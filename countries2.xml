'''The Bahamas''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bahamas.ogg|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|m|ə|z}}, officially the '''Commonwealth of the Bahamas''', is an [[island country]] of the [[Lucayan Archipelago]] consisting of more than 700 [[island]]s, [[cay]]s, and [[islet]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]); northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]; southeast of the US state of [[Florida]] and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. Its capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The designation of &quot;Bahamas&quot; can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]], the Bahamas territory encompasses {{convert|180000|sqmi|km2|disp=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of ocean space.

Originally inhabited by the [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Taíno people|Taino]] people, the Bahamas were the site of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' first landfall in the [[New World]] in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].

The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves: the [[Royal Navy]] resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships; American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today [[Afro-Bahamians|the descendants of slaves and free Africans]] make up nearly 90% of the population; issues related to the slavery years are part of society.

The Bahamas became an independent [[Commonwealth realm]] in 1973, retaining [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its monarch. In terms of [[gross domestic product]] per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]] (following the United States and Canada). Its economy is based on tourism and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Bahamas,%20The&amp;countryCode=bf&amp;regionCode=cam&amp;rank=49#bf Country Comparison :: GDP – per capita (PPP)]. CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Bahamas'' is derived from either the Taino ba ha ma (&quot;big upper middle land&quot;), which was a pronoun for the region used by the indigenous Amerindians,&lt;ref&gt;Bahama Saga: The epic story of the Bahama Islands – Page 47, Peter Barratt – 2004&lt;/ref&gt; while other theories suggest it derives from the Spanish ''baja mar'' (&quot;shallow water or sea&quot; or &quot;[[:es:Bajamar|low tide]]&quot;) reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively it may originate from ''Guanahani'', a local name of unclear meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bahamas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the Bahamas is one of only two countries whose self-standing short name begins with the word &quot;the&quot;, along with [[the Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|title=Ukraine or the Ukraine: Why do some country names have 'the'?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18233844|accessdate=8 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 June 2012}} Habitually, the definite article is sometimes still used when addressing many other countries, including [[Ukraine]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], [[Comoros]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Seychelles]], [[Maldives]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Lebanon]], with varying degrees of accuracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Landing of Columbus (2).jpg|thumb|right||A depiction of Columbus' first landing, claiming possession of the [[New World]] for Spain in [[caravel]]s; the ''[[Niña]]'' and the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]],'' on Watling Island, an island of The Bahamas that the natives called [[Guanahani]] and that he named ''San Salvador'', on October 12, 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03615973 |title=The Journal of Christopher Columbus (during His First Voyage, 1492-93) |page=35 |author=Markham, Clements R. |year=1893 |publisher=London: The Hakluyt Society |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Taíno people|Taino]] people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] people. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in 1492.

Columbus's first landfall in the [[New World]] was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as ''[[Guanahani]]''). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them.

The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to [[Hispaniola]] for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; half of the Taino died from [[smallpox]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;levelId=2100 &quot;Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?&quot;], ''Education Week'', 9 October 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Dumene, Joanne E.

In 1648, the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]], led by [[William Sayle]], migrated from [[Bermuda]]. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named [[Eleuthera]]—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governors]], and administering the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglican&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2009 |url=http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php |title=Diocesan History |publisher=Copyright 2009 Anglican Communications Department |accessdate=7 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090505100933/http://bahamas.anglican.org:80/history.php |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1684 Spanish [[privateer|corsair]] Juan de Alcon [[Raid on Charles Town|raided the capital]], Charles Town (later renamed [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]).

During proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for [[Piracy|pirates]], including the infamous [[Blackbeard]] (c.1680–1718). To put an end to the '[[Pirates' republic]]' and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a [[British overseas territories|crown colony]] in 1718 under the royal governorship of [[Woodes Rogers]]. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, Rogers led local [[militia]] to drive off a [[Battle of Nassau (1720)|Spanish attack]].

During the [[American War of Independence]] in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]]. [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] occupied the capital of Nassau for a [[fortnight]].

In 1782, following the British defeat at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]]. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Before the news was received, however, the [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|islands were recaptured]] by a small British force led by [[Andrew Deveaux]].

After American independence, the British resettled some 7,300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] with their slaves in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.

In 1807, the British abolished the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the [[Royal Navy]] intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.

In the 1820s during the period of the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida, hundreds of American slaves and [[African Seminoles]] escaped from [[Cape Florida]] to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest [[Andros Island]], where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 [[sloop]]s, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at [[Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&amp;SPFTerritory=Florida&amp;SPFType=Site&amp;SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park &quot;Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park&quot;], ''Network to Freedom'', National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vignoles, Charles Blacker (1823) ''Observations on the Floridas'', New York: E.

The United States' [[National Park Service]], which administers the National [[Underground Railroad]] Network to Freedom, is working with the African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) in Nassau on development to identify Red Bays as a site related to American slaves' search for freedom. The museum has researched and documented the African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_partner_details.htm?PARTNERID=13845&amp;PARTNERTerritory=NULL&amp;PARTNERKeywords=Red%20Bays Partners: &quot;African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC)&quot;], Network to Freedom, National Park Service, accessed 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: In trying to retrieve American slaves off the ''Encomium'' from colonial officials (who freed them), the U.S. consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that &quot;he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by Sir Christopher Robinson and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Office in London had ruled that &quot;any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the [[British West Indies]] would be manumitted.&quot; This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;horne103&quot;&gt;[[#Horne|Horne]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The American slave ships ''Comet'' and ''Encomium'' used in the United States domestic [[coastwise slave trade]], were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the ''Comet'' and 48 on the ''Encomium''. Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Horne|Horne]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;debates&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z70-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=brig+Comet+1830&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y_uxAN54OM&amp;sig=l_3rV5PKNYcogWpkSE63wi4aWQ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pclmUZ6CAcng2gWIy4CQAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=brig%20Comet%201830&amp;f=false Register of Debates in Congress, Gales &amp; Seaton], 1837, The section, &quot;Brigs Encomium and Enterprise&quot;, has a collection of lengthy correspondence between US (including M.

Slavery was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished in the British Empire]] on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 American slaves from the ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprise]]'', which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the ''Hermosa'', which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Horne|Horne]], pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable case was that of the ''Creole'' in 1841: as a result of a [[slave revolt]] on board, the leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in [[New Orleans]]. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The ''Creole'' case has been described as the &quot;most successful slave revolt in U.S. history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;williams&quot;&gt;{{cite news

These incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

===20th century===
[[File:The Duke of Windsor (1945).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Edward VIII]], the [[Duke of Windsor]] and [[Governor of the Bahamas]] from 1940 to 1945.]]
In August 1940, after his abdication of the British throne, the [[Duke of Windsor]] was installed as [[Governor of the Bahamas]], arriving with his wife, the [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess]]. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they &quot;tried to make the best of a bad situation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor installed&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as &quot;a third-class British colony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Michael (1982). ''The Duke of Windsor's War,'' London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. ISBN 0-297-77947-8, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the &quot;Out Islands&quot; that November, on [[Axel Wenner-Gren]]'s yacht, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor opened&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Foreign Office]] strenuously objected to the trip because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]] of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor opened&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Michael (1982). ''The Duke of Windsor's War''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. ISBN 0-297-77947-8, pp. 154–159, 230–233&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-white peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in June 1942, when there was a &quot;full-scale riot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor unrest&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on &quot;mischief makers – [[communists]]&quot; and &quot;men of Central European [[Jewish]] descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot;&gt;[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] (1991). ''King Edward VIII: The Official Biography''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-394-57730-2. pp. 471–472&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke resigned the post on 16 March 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]] (September 2004; online edition January 2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31061 &quot;Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor (1894–1972)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/31061}}, retrieved 1 May 2010 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor resigned&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], p. 359 places the date of his resignation as 15 March, and that he left on 5 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir. Roland Symonette Park Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign at the entrance of the Sir Roland Symonette Park in [[North Eleuthera]] district commemorating Sir [[Roland Theodore Symonette]], the Bahamas' first [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Premier]].]]
Modern political development began after the [[Second World War]]. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the [[United Bahamian Party]], as the first Premier.

A new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahaman Proposes Independence Move |work=The Washington Post |date=19 August 1966 |page=A20 |agency=United Press International |url=http://search.proquest.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/142811526/DB2D6A93B41148F2PQ/187?accountid=46320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Lynden Pindling]] of the [[Progressive Liberal Party]], became the first black Premier of the majority-black colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]].

Based on the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.

The [[College of the Bahamas]] is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, COB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. COB is on track to become the national &quot;University of The Bahamas&quot; (UOB) in 2015.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Bahamas 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Bahamas from space. [[NASA]] [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellite image, 2009]]
The country lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[28th parallel north|28°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian west|72°]] and [[80th meridian west|80°W]].

In 1864, the [[Governor of the Bahamas]] reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Albury, Paul (1975). ''The Story of the Bahamas''. London: MacMillan Caribbean, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest island to the United States is [[Bimini]], which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] is to the east of [[Grand Bahama]]. The southeasternmost island is [[Inagua]]. The largest island is [[Andros Island]]. Other inhabited islands include [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], [[Exuma]] and [[Mayaguana]]. [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of [[New Providence]].

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Alvernia]] (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of {{convert|63|m|ft}}.
[[File:Hurricane wilma devastation.jpg|thumb|right|Damaged homes in the Bahamas in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Wilma]] in 2005.]]
To the southeast, the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and three more extensive submarine features called [[Mouchoir Bank]], [[Silver Bank]] and [[Navidad Bank]], are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas.

===Climate===
{{See also|Geography of the Bahamas#Climate}}
The climate of the Bahamas is [[tropical savannah climate]] or ''Aw'' according to [[Köppen climate classification]]. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall into the {{convert|3|-|5|°C}} range for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American landmass. Otherwise, the low latitude, warm tropical [[Gulf Stream]], and low [[elevation]] give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. There is only an 8&amp;nbsp;°C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Islands - Bahamas (rev. 2015)|url=http://www.caribbeanislands.org/the-bahamas/|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sunlight annually.

Tropical storms and hurricanes affect the Bahamas. In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] passed over the northern portions of the islands, and [[Hurricane Floyd]] passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Bahamas}}
[[File:BahamianParliamentPanorama.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Parliament of the Bahamas|Bahamian Parliament]], located in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].]]

The Bahamas is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] headed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the [[Westminster system]]. The Bahamas is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] as a [[Commonwealth realm]], retaining the Queen as [[head of state]] (represented by a [[List of Governors-General of the Bahamas|Governor-General]]).

[[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], which consists of a 38-member [[House of Assembly of the Bahamas|House of Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]), with members elected from [[Plurality voting system|single-member districts]], and a 16-member [[Parliament of The Bahamas#Senate|Senate]], with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the [[Leader of the Opposition|Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]], and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahamas 1973 (rev. 2002)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Bahamas_2002?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is [[Dame Marguerite Pindling]], and the current [[List of heads of government of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]] is [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] [[Perry Christie]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|P.C.]], [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]].

Constitutional safeguards include [[freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of the press|press]], [[Freedom of religion|worship]], [[Freedom of movement|movement]] and [[Freedom of association|association]]. The [[Judicial independence|judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on [[English law]].

===Political culture===
The Bahamas has a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[centre-left]] [[Progressive Liberal Party]] and the [[centre-right]] [[Free National Movement]]. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the [[Bahamas Democratic Movement]], the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the [[Democratic National Alliance (Bahamas)|Democratic National Alliance]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Further|Foreign relations of the Bahamas}}

The Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], represented by an ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[High Commissioner]] in [[London]]. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM).

===Military===
{{Main|Royal Bahamas Defence Force}}

[[File:Hmbsnassau.jpg|100 KBpx|thumb|HMBS Nassau (P-61).]]
Its military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which is composed with a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the [[Elizabeth II of The Bahamas|Queen]], to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community ([[Caricom|CARICOM]])'s Regional Security Task Force.

The RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration, poaching and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Local government in the Bahamas}}
[[File:Districts of the Bahamas (Labeled).png|thumb|350px|Districts of the Bahamas.]]
The districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except [[New Providence]] (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors &amp; Town Committee Members]. Bahamas.gov.bs. Retrieved on 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

The Bahamas uses [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drive-on-the-Left]] traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth.

The districts other than New Providence are:

===National flag===
{{main|Flag of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas.svg|thumb|upright|National flag of the Bahamas]]
The colours embodied in the design of the Bahamian flag symbolise the image and aspirations of the people of the Bahamas; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun, sand and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.

The symbolism of the flag is as follows: Black, a strong colour, represents the vigour and force of a united people, the triangle pointing towards the body of the flag represents the enterprise and determination of the Bahamian people to develop and possess the rich resources of sun and sea symbolised by gold and aquamarine respectively. In reference to the representation of the people with the colour black, some white Bahamians have joked that they are represented in the thread which &quot;holds it all together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flag.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flag]. Bahamasschools.com. Retrieved on 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are rules on how to use the flag for certain events. For a funeral the national flag should be draped over the coffin covering the top completely but not covering the bearers. The black triangle on the flag should be placed over the head of the deceased in the coffin.

===Coat of arms===
{{Main|Coat of arms of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Bahamas.svg|thumb|upright|Bahamian Coat of Arms]]
The coat of arms is like a theme statement that describes the Bahamian people.
The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a [[marlin]] and a [[flamingo]], which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa María]]'' of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is scripted the national motto:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms].

===National flower===
The [[Tecoma stans|yellow elder]] was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama islands, and it blooms throughout the year.

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s—the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the [[Young Women's Christian Association|Y.W.C.A.]] Garden Club.

They reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the [[bougainvillea]], [[hibiscus]] and [[Delonix regia|poinciana]]—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the [[United States Virgin Islands]]) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flower].

By [[List of countries by GDP per capita|the terms of GDP per capita]], the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD GDP (current US$) |Data |Table]. World Bank, Retrieved on 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Prince George Wharf in Nassau Harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Cruise ships]] in Nassau Harbour.]]
The Bahamas relies on [[tourism]] to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html &quot;The Bahamas – Economy&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of the Nations'', Retrieved 21 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of which were cruise visitors.

===Financial services===
After tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.

The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the [[Central Bank of the Bahamas]] (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Central Bank administers restrictions and [[Capital control|controls on capital]] and money market instruments. The [[Bahamas Securities Exchange|Bahamas International Securities Exchange]] consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bahamas.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of the Bahamas exports.]]
The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, [[VAT]], licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributions Table|url=http://www.nib-bahamas.com/_m1722/Brochures/default.aspx|publisher=The National Insurance Board of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{Further|Agriculture in the Bahamas}}

Agriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include [[onion]]s, [[okra]], and [[tomato]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]], [[cucumber]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]]s and [[sweet potato]]es.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of the Bahamas}}
The Bahamas has an estimated population of 382,825, of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate of −2.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html#top Country Comparison &quot;Total fertility rate&quot;], [[CIA World Factbook]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bahamas, the term ''Bahamian'' is most commonly used. The people do not identify as ''West Indian.''

The [[infant mortality rate]] is 23.21 deaths/1,000 live births. Residents have a life expectancy at birth of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, 66.32 years for males. The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
The ethnic makeup of the Bahamas is 85% [[Afro-Bahamians|African]], 12% [[European Bahamian|European]], and 3% [[Asian Bahamian]] or [[Latin American]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; Given intermarriage and interracial unions over the centuries, most families have branches, and even immediate family members, spanning the entire spectrum of skin colour among 'light', 'brown' and 'unequivocally dark brown.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/a_z_of_bahamas_heritage.html |title=A-Z of Bahamas Heritage |publisher=Isbndb.com |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the many degrees of African and European ancestry over centuries of mixed-race unions.

[[File:Gary White Visits Local Schools - Bahamas.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Afro-Bahamian]] children at a local school.]]
[[Afro-Bahamians]] are Bahamian nationals whose primary ancestry was based in [[West Africa]]. The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from [[Bermuda]]; they arrived with the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] looking for new lives.

Since the colonial era of plantations, Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas; in the 21st century, they account for some 85% of the country's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; The [[Haiti]]an community is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Because of an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Nick (20 September 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8257660.stm &quot;Bahamas outlook clouds for Haitians&quot;], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 16,598 European Bahamians at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics&quot;/&gt; [[European Bahamian]]s, or Bahamians of European and mixed European descent, are mainly the descendants of the [[Puritan|English Puritans]] and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|American Loyalists]] who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bhswgw/land.htm The Names of Loyalist Settlers and Grants of Land Which They Received from the British Government: 1778 – 1783]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; They form the largest minority group in the Bahamas, making up some 12% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; Many Southern Loyalists went to [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]], which is about 50% European.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas, Rachel J. and Christmas, Walter (1984) ''Fielding's Bermuda and the Bahamas 1985''.

A small portion of the Euro Bahamian population is descended from [[Greece|Greek]] labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's population, and have preserved their distinct [[Greek Bahamians|Greek Bahamian]] culture.

===Languages===
The [[official language]] of the Bahamas is [[English language|English]]. Many residents speak the [[Bahamian English|Bahamian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahamas-guide.info/travel.basics/languages/ &quot;Bahamas Languages&quot;] – accessed 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 1995 estimates 98.2% of the adult population is literate.

===Religion===
{{Further|Religion in the Bahamas}}

The islands' population is predominantly Christian, with Baptists representing 35.4% of the population, Anglican 15.1%, Roman Catholic 13.5%, Pentecostal 8.1%, Church of God 4.8%, Methodist 4.2%, other Christian 15.2%,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; other Protestant 12%, none or unknown 3%, other 2%&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20130115201437/http://www.thebahamasguide.com/facts/religion.htm Religion, Faith and God in The Bahamas]. thebahamasguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;other&quot; category includes Jews, Muslims, Baha'is, Hindus, Rastafarians and practitioners of [[Obeah]].&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51625.htm &quot;Bahamas – International Religious Freedom Report 2005&quot;] – accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Junkanoo]] celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].]]
In the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called &quot;straw&quot;, is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called &quot;Voodoo dolls&quot;, even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.&lt;ref&gt;Hurbon, Laennec (1995). &quot;American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.&quot; ''Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou''. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: [[UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History]], 181–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of folk magic ([[obeah]]) is practised by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2005 – Bahamas|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51625.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110615023254/http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/statutes/statute_CHAPTER_84.html#Ch84s232 &quot;Practising Obeah, etc.&quot;], Ch. 84 Penal Code. laws.bahamas.gov.bs&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Junkanoo]] is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing' ,music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every [[Boxing Day]] and [[New Year's Day]]. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.

[[Regatta]]s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned [[Boat|work boats]], as well as an onshore festival.

Many dishes are associated with [[Bahamian cuisine]], which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the &quot;Pineapple Fest&quot; in Gregory Town, [[Eleuthera]] or the &quot;Crab Fest&quot; on Andros. Other significant traditions include [[story telling]].

Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders.&lt;ref&gt;Collinwood, Dean W. and Dodge, Steve (1989) ''Modern Bahamian Society'', Caribbean Books, ISBN 0931209013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinwood, Dean and Phillips, Rick  (spring 1990), &quot;The National Literature of the New Bahamas&quot;, ''Weber Studies'', Vol. 7, No. 1: 43–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.

Early civilisations in Myanmar included the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Pyu city-states]] in [[Upper Burma]] and the [[Mon kingdoms]] in [[Lower Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early civilizations of Southeast Asia |publisher=Altamira Press |author=O'Reilly, Dougald JW |year=2007 |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-7591-0279-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century, the [[Bamar people]] entered the upper [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] valley and, following the establishment of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in the 1050s, the [[Burmese language]], [[Culture of Burma|culture]] and [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the [[Taungoo Dynasty]], the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the [[history of Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century [[Konbaung Dynasty]] ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled [[Manipur]] and [[Assam]] as well. The British conquered Myanmar after three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]] in the 19th century and the country became a [[British rule in Burma|British colony]]. Myanmar became an independent nation in [[Independence Day (Burma)|1948]], initially as a [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|democratic nation]] and then, following a [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|coup d'état in 1962]], a [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|military dictatorship]]. While the military dictatorship formally ended in 2011, most of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Party|party]] leaders are former military officers.

For most of its independent years, the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and  [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|Burma's myriad ethnic groups]] have been involved in one of the world's [[List of ongoing armed conflicts|longest-running ongoing civil wars]]. During this time, the [[United Nations]] and several other organisations have reported consistent and systematic [[Human rights in Burma|human rights]] violations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/burma |title=Burma |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/myanmar |title=Myanmar Human Rights |publisher=Amnesty International USA |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-burma |title=World Report 2012: Burma |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130630121229/http://www.hrw.org:80/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-burma |archivedate=30 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] was officially dissolved following a [[Burmese general election, 2010|2010 general election]], and a nominally civilian government was installed.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of Myanmar}}
In 1989, the military government [[Geographical renaming|officially changed]] the English translations of many names dating back to [[British Burma|Burma's colonial period]] or earlier, including that of the country itself: &quot;Burma&quot; became &quot;Myanmar&quot;. The renaming remains a contested issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bV3shLzx0B4C&amp;lpg=PP1|title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics |last=Houtman |first=Gustaaf |year=1999 |series=ILCAA Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa Monograph Series No. 33|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa |pages=43–47 |isbn=978-4-87297-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use &quot;Burma&quot; because they do not recognise the legitimacy of the ruling military government or its authority to rename the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;steinberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=David I. |date=2002 |title=Burma: The State of Myanmar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSTuWZ0BMmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Georgetown University|Georgetown University Press]]|page=xi|isbn=1-58901-285-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's official full name is the &quot;Republic of the Union of Myanmar&quot; ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပြည်ထောင်စုသမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်}}, ''{{transl|my|Pyidaunzu Thanmăda Myăma Nainngandaw}}'', {{IPA-my|pjìdàʊɴzṵ θàɴməda̰ mjəmà nàɪɴŋàɴdɔ̀|pron}}).

In English, the country is popularly known as either &quot;Burma&quot; or &quot;Myanmar&quot; {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Myanmar.ogg|ˈ|m|j|ɑː|n|ˌ|m|ɑr}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; /&gt; Both these names are derived from the name of the majority Burmese [[Bamar people|Bamar]] ethnic group. ''Myanmar'' is considered to be the literary form of the name of the group, while ''Burma'' is derived from &quot;Bamar&quot;, the colloquial form of the group's name. Depending on the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] used, the pronunciation would be ''{{transl|my|Bama}}'' ({{IPA-my|bəmà|pron}}) or ''{{transl|my|Myamah}}'' ({{IPA-my|mjəmà|pron}}). The name ''Burma'' has been in use in English since the 18th century.

''Burma'' continues to be used in English by the governments of many countries, such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dittmer&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world/burma |title=UK and Burma |publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |access-date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official [[United States]] policy retains Burma as the country's name, although the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]'s website lists the country as &quot;Burma (Myanmar)&quot; and [[Barack Obama]] has referred to the country by both names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma or Myanmar?

Archaeological evidence shows that ''[[Homo erectus]]'' lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 400,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=John Stewart Bowman|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50004-3|page=476|url=http://books.google.com.mm/books?id=cYoHOqC7Yx4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first evidence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is dated to about 11,000 BC, in a [[Stone Age]] culture called the ''Anyathian'' with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar. Evidence of [[Neolithic|neolithic age]] domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BC has been discovered in the form of [[cave painting]]s near the city of [[Taunggyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooler |first=Richard M. |title=The Art and Culture of Burma (Chapter 1) |year=2002 |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/BurmaArt_TOC.htm |publisher=Northern Illinois University |location=DeKalb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bronze Age]] arrived ''circa'' 1500 BC when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iron Age]] began around 500 BC with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BC and 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson |first=Bob |title=A Pyu Homeland in the Samon Valley: a new theory of the origins of Myanmar's early urban system |url=http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/~hudson/BH2005Jan.pdf |journal=Myanmar Historical Commission Golden Jubilee International Conference |date=March 2005 |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131126021929/http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/~hudson/BH2005Jan.pdf |archivedate=26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences from outside sources such as India and Thailand, as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places, possibly through trade.&lt;ref&gt;Coupey, A. S. (2008). Infant and child burials in the Samon valley, Myanmar.

===Early city-states===
Around the second century BC the first-known [[city-state]]s emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Pyu city-states]], the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=D.G.E. |title=Burma |edition=3rd |year=1960 |publisher=Hutchinson University Library|isbn=978-1-4067-3503-1|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Elizabeth H. |title=Early Landscapes of Myanmar |year=2007 |publisher=River Books |location=Bangkok |isbn=974-9863-31-3|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with [[India]], importing [[Buddhism]] as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from [[Nanzhao]] between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the [[Bamar people]] founded a small settlement at [[Bagan]]. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Burma===
{{Main|Pagan Kingdom|Taungoo Dynasty|Konbaung Dynasty}}

[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|[[Pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s in present-day [[Bagan]], the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]].]]
Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when [[Anawrahta]] founded the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the [[Khmer Empire]] were two main powers in [[mainland Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burmese language]] and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms by the late 12th century.&lt;ref name=mha-63-65&gt;{{cite book |last=Htin Aung |first=Maung |title=A History of Burma |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York and London |year=1967|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] slowly began to spread to the village level, although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Burmese folk religion|folk religion]] remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301) toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.&lt;ref name=mha-63-65 /&gt;

[[File:MysticalMraukU.jpg|thumb|Temples at [[Mrauk U]].]]

Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [[Shan people|Shan migrants]] who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing [[Shan States]] came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, [[Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437.

Early on, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] (1385–1424) but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the [[Confederation of Shan States]] conquered Ava itself, and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.

Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [[Culture of Myanmar|Burmese culture]]. [[Burmese literature]] &quot;grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse&quot;, and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest [[Burmese chronicles|pan-Burma chronicles]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period.

===Taungoo and colonialism===
[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|Bayinnaung's Empire in 1580.]]
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, due to the efforts of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]], a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious king [[Tabinshwehti]] defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the [[Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1534–41)]]. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of [[mainland Southeast Asia]] including the Shan states, [[Lan Na]], [[Manipur]], [[Mong Mao]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mercenaries established [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] at [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam).

The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Meitei people|Meithei]] raids into [[Upper Myanmar]] and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].]]

After the fall of Ava, the [[Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War]] involved one resistance group under [[Alaungpaya]] defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759, he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur, and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of [[Laos]] (1765) and fought and won the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)]] against Ayutthaya and the [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–69)]] against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] (1765–1769).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 184–187&lt;/ref&gt;

With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770, and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The breadth of this empire was short lived. Burma lost Arakan, [[Manipur]], [[Assam]] and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826). In 1852, the British easily seized [[Lower Burma]] in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. King [[Mindon Min]] tried to modernise the kingdom, and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885.

Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms, and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 202–206&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.

The country was colonised by Britain following three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]] (1824–1885). British rule brought social, economic, cultural and administrative changes.

With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being [[Third Anglo-Burmese War#Annexation and resistance|annexed]] on 1 January 1886. Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]] community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an important port between Calcutta and Singapore.

Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Yangon (Rangoon) on occasion all the way until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Collis |year=1945 |title=Trials in Burma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for [[Burmese culture]] and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. [[U Wisara]], an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes while imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Heinz |last=Bechert |year=1984 |title=The World of Buddhism-Buddhist Monks and Nuns in Society and Culture |isbn=978-0-87196-982-8 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain and [[Ba Maw]] the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule and he opposed the participation of Great Britain, and by extension Burma, in World War II. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before Japan formally entered the Second World War, [[Aung San]] formed the [[Burma Independence Army]] in Japan.

A major battleground, Burma was devastated during [[World War II]]. By [[Japanese conquest of Burma|March 1942]], within months after they entered the war, [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed. A [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Burmese Executive Administration]] headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Wingate's British [[Chindits]] were formed into [[long-range penetration]] groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bennett, Will |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/chindits-remember-their-fallen-comrades-1597019.html |title=Chindits remember their fallen comrades |work=The Independent |date=20 August 1995 |accessdate=20 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar American unit, [[Merrill's Marauders]], followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/vets/stories/cbi-marauders.html |title=China-Burma-India: Merrill's Marauders.

The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma. Only 1,700 prisoners were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Towle, Philip |author2=Kosuge, Margaret |author3=Kibata, Yōichi |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&amp;pg=PA48|title=Japanese prisoners of war |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |page=48 |isbn=1-85285-192-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese as part of the Burma Independence Army, many Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, served in the British Burma Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Fellowes-Gordon |year=1971 |title=The Battle For Naw Seng's Kingdom: General Stilwel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burma National Army]] and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945.

Following World War II, [[Aung San]] negotiated the [[Panglong Agreement]] with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Myanmar as a unified state. Aung Zan Wai, Pe Khin, [[Hmu Aung|Bo Hmu Aung]], Sir Maung Gyi, Dr. Sein Mya Maung, [[Myoma U Than Kywe]] were among the negotiators of the historical Panglong Conference negotiated with Bamar leader General Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947.

[[File:Sao Shwe Thaik and Hubert Elvin Rance.jpg|thumb|British governor [[Hubert Elvin Rance]] and Sao Shwe Thaik at the flag raising ceremony on 4 January 1948 ([[Independence Day of Burma]]).]]
On [[Independence Day (Burma)|4 January 1948]], the nation became an independent republic, named the ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first President and [[U Nu]] as its first Prime Minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A [[bicameral]] parliament was formed, consisting of a [[Chamber of Deputies (Burma)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Chamber of Nationalities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm |title=The Constitution of the Union of Burma |accessdate=7 July 2006 |year=1947 |publisher=DVB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615072018/http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm|archivedate=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections were held in [[Burmese general election, 1951–1952|1951–1952]], [[Burmese general election, 1956|1956]] and [[Burmese general election, 1960|1960]].

The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the [[Panglong Agreement]], which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of [[Lower Burma]] and [[Upper Burma]], and the [[Frontier Areas]], which had been administered separately by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Smith |year=1991 |title=Burma -Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity |publisher=Zed Books |location=London and New Jersey |pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[U Thant]], then the Union of Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former Secretary to the Prime Minister, was elected [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], a position he held for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=14|issue=9|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7610

===Military rule (1962–2011)===
On 2 March 1962, the military led by General [[Ne Win]] [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|took control of Burma through a coup d'état]] and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a [[Union Revolutionary Council|revolutionary council]] headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were [[nationalised]] or brought under government control under the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;thantmyintu&quot;&gt;[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]]&lt;/ref&gt; which combined [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style nationalisation and [[central planning]].

A new [[Constitution of Burma|constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma]] was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the country was ruled as a [[One-party state|one-party system]], with the General and other military officers resigning and ruling through the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP).&lt;ref name=&quot;christinafink&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Fink |year=2001 |title=Living Silence: Burma under Military Rule |isbn=1-85649-926-X |publisher=White Lotus |location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Myanmar became one of the world's most impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/28/burma.uk |title=The Burma road to ruin |work=The Guardian |location=London  |first=Mark |last=Tallentire |date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:8888 Uprising.jpg|right|thumb|Protesters gathering in central [[Rangoon]], 1988.]]
There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years and these were almost always violently suppressed. On [[1962 Rangoon University Protests|7 July 1962]], the government broke up demonstrations at [[Yangon University|Rangoon University]], killing 15 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;thantmyintu&quot; /&gt; In 1974, the military violently suppressed [[U Thant Funeral Crisis|anti-government protests]] at the funeral of [[U Thant]]. Student protests in 1975, 1976 and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.&lt;ref name=&quot;christinafink&quot; /&gt;

In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General [[Saw Maung]] staged a coup d'état and formed the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared [[martial law]] after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/pyithu_hluttaw_election_law.htm |title=Pyithu Hluttaw Election Law |accessdate=11 July 2006 |date=31 May 1989 |work=State Law and Order Restoration Council |publisher=iBiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; SLORC changed the country's official English name from the &quot;Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma&quot; to the &quot;Union of Myanmar&quot; in 1989.

In May 1990, the government held [[free elections]] for the first time in almost 30 years and the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), the party of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Burmese general election, 1990|won 392 out of a total 492 seats]] (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/Elections-02.htm |title=1990 Multi-party Democracy General Elections |author=Han, Khin Kyaw |date=1 February 2003 |work=National League for Democracy |publisher=iBiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to rule the nation as SLORC until 1997, and then as the [[State Peace and Development Council]] (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011.

On 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from [[Yangon]] to a site near [[Pyinmana]] in November 2005, officially named the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], meaning &quot;city of the kings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm |title=Burma's new capital stages parade |publisher=BBC News |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically [[Bamar people|Bamar]] central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restricted Areas in Burma |url=http://www.tourismburma.com/restricted-areas-in-burma/ |publisher=Tourism Burma |accessdate=27 March 2013 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130102230338/http://www.tourismburma.com:80/restricted-areas-in-burma/ |archivedate=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed conflict between [[Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army|ethnic Chinese rebels]] and the [[Tatmadaw|Myanmar Armed Forces]] have resulted in the [[2015 Kokang offensive|Kokang offensive]] in February 2015. The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the Chinese side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/tens-thousands-flee-war-airstrikes-kokang-region/48271|title=Tens of thousands flee war, airstrikes in Kokang region|work=DVB Multimedia Group|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the incident the government of China was accused of giving military assistance to the [[Kokang people|ethnic Chinese]] rebels. Burmese officials have been historically 'manipulated' and pressured by the communist Chinese government throughout Burmese modern history to create closer and binding ties with China, creating a Chinese satellite state in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/kokang-02132015185129.html Myanmar Kokang Rebels Deny Receiving Chinese Weapons]&quot;.

===Democratic reforms===
{{Main|2011–12 Burmese political reforms}}
The goal of the [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008|Burmese constitutional referendum of 2008]], held on 10 May 2008, is the creation of a &quot;discipline-flourishing democracy&quot;. As part of the referendum process, the name of the country was changed from the &quot;Union of Myanmar&quot; to the &quot;Republic of the Union of Myanmar&quot;, and general [[Burmese general election, 2010|elections]] were held under the new constitution in 2010. Observer accounts of the 2010 election describe the event as mostly peaceful; however, allegations of polling station irregularities were raised, and the United Nations (UN) and a number of [[Western world|Western]] countries condemned the elections as fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2064470,00.html |title=The Slow Thaw of Burma's Notorious Military Junta |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=1 September 2011 |author=Marshall, Andrew |date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] declared victory in the 2010 elections, stating that it had been favoured by 80 percent of the votes; however, the claim was disputed by numerous pro-democracy opposition groups who asserted that the military regime had engaged in rampant fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;tni.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/world/asia/22nations.html |title=U.N.

Opinions differ whether the transition to [[liberal democracy]] is underway. According to some reports, the military's presence continues as the label 'disciplined democracy' suggests. This label asserts that the Burmese military is allowing certain civil liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into [[Politics of Myanmar|Burmese politics]]. Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition—here, &quot;transition&quot; does not refer to a transition to a [[liberal democracy]], but transition to a quasi-military rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0095327X13492943|title=Burma's Transition to Quasi-Military Rule: From Rulers to Guardians?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|volume=40|issue=4|pages=742|year=2013|last1=Bunte |first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2010 election, the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards [[liberal democracy]], a [[mixed economy]], and reconciliation, although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms. The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from house arrest, the establishment of the [[Myanmar National Human Rights Commission|National Human Rights Commission]], the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968 |title=Obstacles lie ahead in Burma's bid for reform |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |author=Loyn, David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the post-election reforms has been observed in numerous areas, including ASEAN's approval of Myanmar's bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabellero-Anthony|first1=Mely|title=&quot;Myanmar's Chairmanship of ASEAN: Challenges and Opportunities&quot;, Myanmar's Growing Regional Role|journal=NBR Special report|date=March 2014|url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=741}}&lt;/ref&gt; the visit by United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in December 2011 for the encouragement of further progress—it was the first visit by a Secretary of State in more than fifty years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Budding Friendship on Display as Clinton, Burma's Suu Kyi Meet Again|author=Hepler, Lauren|author2=Voorhees, Josh|url=http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/18/hillary_clinton_to_visit_myanmar_burma_first_trip_by_secretary_of_state_in_more_than_50_years.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617073614/http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/18/hillary_clinton_to_visit_myanmar_burma_first_trip_by_secretary_of_state_in_more_than_50_years.html|archivedate=17 June 2013|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=1 December 2011|quote=Wrapping up a historic three-day visit to Myanmar [Burma], the first by a secretary of state to the Southeast Asian nation in more than 50 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Clinton met with the Burmese president and former military commander [[Thein Sein]], as well as opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Myers, Steven Lee |title=Clinton Says U.S. Will Relax Some Restrictions on Myanmar |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/asia/us-will-relax-curbs-on-aid-to-myanmar.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 December 2011 |page=A6 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the participation of Aung San Suu Kyi's [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) party in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government's abolition of the laws that previously barred the NLD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15787052 |title=US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to visit Burma |publisher=BBC |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2013, about 100&lt;ref name=&quot;mmtimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar set to release some 70 prisoners|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/7577-myanmar-set-to-release-some-70-prisoners.html|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=The Myanmar Times|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;irrawaddy1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Weng|first=Lawi|title=Burma Govt Releases 73 Political Prisoners|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burma-govt-releases-73-political-prisoners.html|accessdate=24 July 2013|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; political prisoners remain imprisoned, while conflict between the Burmese Army and local insurgent groups continues.

In 1 April 2012 [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|by-elections]] the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats; previously an illegal organisation, the NLD had never won a Burmese election until this time.

===2015 Myanmar general elections===
{{main|Myanmar general election, 2015}}
Myanmar general elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since 1990. The results gave the [[National League for Democracy]] an [[absolute majority]] of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is constitutionally barred from the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Wins Majority in Myanmar |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34805806 |accessdate=13 November 2015 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The new parliament is expected to convene on 1 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Suu Kyi's novice MPs learn ropes in outgoing Myanmar parliament|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/suu-kyi-s-novice-mps/2464054.html|website=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Myanmar}}

[[File:Un-myanmar.png|thumb|450px|A map of Myanmar]]
Myanmar has a total area of {{convert|678500|km2}}. It lies between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[29th parallel north|29°N]], and longitudes [[92nd meridian east|92°]] and [[102nd meridian east|102°E]]. As of February 2011, Myanmar consisted of 14 states and regions, 67 districts, 330 townships, 64 sub-townships, 377 towns, 2,914 Wards, 14,220 village tracts and 68,290 villages.

Burma is bordered in the northwest by the [[Chittagong Division]] of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] states of India. Its north and northeast border is with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[Yunnan]] province for a Sino-Burman border total of {{convert|2185|km|abbr=on}}. It is bounded by [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] to the southeast. Burma has {{convert|1930|km|abbr=on}} of contiguous coastline along the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Andaman Sea]] to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt;

In the north, the [[Hengduan Mountains]] form the border with China. [[Hkakabo Razi]], located in [[Kachin State]], at an elevation of {{convert|5881|m|ft|0}}, is the highest point in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Dr. Patrick Hesp |year=2000 |title=Geographica's World Reference |publisher=Random House Australia |pages=738, 741|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mountain ranges, such as the [[Rakhine Yoma]], the [[Bago Yoma]], the [[Shan Hills]] and the [[Tenasserim Hills]] exist within Myanmar, all of which run north-to-south from the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;myathan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Mya |last=Than |year=2005 |title=Myanmar in ASEAN: Regional Co-operation Experience |isbn=9812302107 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain chains divide Myanmar's three river systems, which are the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]], [[Salween River|Salween (Thanlwin)]], and the [[Sittaung River|Sittaung]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;myatthein&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Myat |last=Thein |year=2005 |title=Economic Development of Myanmar |isbn=9812302115 |publisher=Inst. of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar's longest river, nearly {{convert|2170|km|mi|0}} long, flows into the [[Gulf of Martaban]]. Fertile plains exist in the valleys between the mountain chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;myathan&quot; /&gt; The majority of Myanmar's population lives in the Irrawaddy valley, which is situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan Plateau.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Myanmar}}

{{Burma Administrative Divisions Image Map}}
Myanmar is divided into seven states ({{my|ပြည်နယ်}}) and seven regions ({{my|တိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}), formerly called divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar/index.htm |title=Myanmar. States &amp; Regions |publisher=Myanmar's NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regions are predominantly [[Bamar people|Bamar]] (that is, mainly inhabited by the dominant ethnic group). States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into [[Districts of Myanmar|districts]], which are further subdivided into townships, [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]], and villages.

Below are the number of districts, townships, cities/towns, wards, village groups and villages in each divisions and states of Myanmar as of 31 December 2001:&lt;ref&gt;''List of Districts, Townships, Cities/Towns, Wards, Village Groups and Villages in Union of Myanmar'' published by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Union of Myanmar on 31 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Myanmar}}
[[File:MonStateMudon.jpg|thumb|The limestone landscape of [[Mon State]].]]
Much of the country lies between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Equator]]. It lies in the [[monsoon]] region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually. Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] in the [[river delta|delta]] region is approximately {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, while average annual rainfall in the Dry Zone in central Myanmar is less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The Northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}}. Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;myatthein&quot; /&gt;

===Wildlife===
Myanmar's slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and [[ecosystem]]s. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable [[teak]] in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of [[acacia]], [[bamboo]], [[Hopea odorata|ironwood]] and ''[[Magnolia champaca]]''. [[Coconut]] and [[Areca catechu|betel palm]] and rubber have been introduced. In the highlands of the north, [[oak]], [[pine]] and various [[rhododendron]]s cover much of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199909/msg00690.html |title=Myanmar's Forest Law and Rules |publisher=BurmaLibrary.org |accessdate=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest acreage and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Robert |last2=Bindloss |first2=Joseph |last3=Butler |first3=Stuart |year=2009 |chapter=Environment: National Parks |title=Myanmar (Burma)|edition=10th |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=Footscray, Victoria, Australia |page=85 |isbn=978-1-74104-718-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands along the coast support all varieties of [[tropical fruit]]s and once had large areas of [[Burmese Coast mangroves|mangroves]] although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared. In much of central Myanmar (the Dry Zone), vegetation is sparse and stunted.

Typical [[jungle]] animals, particularly tigers and [[leopard]]s, occur sparsely in Myanmar. In upper Myanmar, there are [[rhinoceros]], wild [[Bubalus|buffalo]], [[wild boar]]s, [[deer]], [[antelope]], and elephants, which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the [[timber|lumber industry]]. Smaller mammals are also numerous, ranging from [[gibbon]]s and [[monkey]]s to [[flying fox]]es and [[tapir]]s. The abundance of birds is notable with over 800 species, including parrots, [[peafowl]], [[pheasant]]s, [[crow]]s, [[heron]]s, and [[paddy field|paddybirds]]. Among reptile species there are [[crocodile]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[cobra]]s, [[Burmese python]]s, and [[turtle]]s. Hundreds of species of [[freshwater]] fish are wide-ranging, plentiful and are very important food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-culture/myanmar-flora-fauna.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514182454/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-culture/myanmar-flora-fauna.htm |archivedate=14 May 2012 |title=&quot;Flora and Fauna&quot; at |publisher=Myanmars.net |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of protected areas, see [[List of protected areas of Myanmar]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Myanmar}}
[[File:Myanmar-Lower-House-Parliament.jpg|right|thumb|[[Assembly of the Union]] (Pyidaungsu Hluttaw)]]
The constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The country is governed as a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary republic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA geos&quot; /&gt; with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] (with a [[President of Myanmar|President]] accountable to the legislature), with a portion of legislators appointed by the military and others elected in general elections. The current president, inaugurated on 30 March 2011, is [[Thein Sein]].

The legislature, called the [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]], is bicameral and made up of two houses: the 224-seat upper house [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (House of Nationalities) and the 440-seat lower house [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] (House of Representatives). The upper house consists of 224 members, of whom 168 are directly elected and 56 are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces. The lower house consists of 440 members, of whom 330 are directly elected and 110 are appointed by the armed forces.

===Political culture===

In May 2013, Thein Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the [[White House]] in 47 years; the last Burmese leader to visit the White House was [[Ne Win]] in September 1966. President [[Barack Obama]] praised the former general for political and economic reforms, and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and the United States. Political activists objected to the visit due to concerns over human rights abuses in Myanmar but Obama assured Thein Sein that Myanmar will receive US support. The two leaders discussed to release more political prisoners, the institutionalisation of political reform and rule of law, and ending ethnic conflict in Myanmar—the two governments agreed to sign a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Vows US Support As Myanmar Leader Visits|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=185449969|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521150924/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=185449969|archivedate=21 May 2013|publisher=NPR|date=20 May 2013|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Child soldiers====
Child soldiers have and continue to play a major part in the Burmese Army as well as Burmese rebel movements. ''The Independent'' reported in June 2012 that &quot;Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Burmese children a week conscripted into military |newspaper=The Independent, |author=Taylor, Jerome |date=19 June 2012 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/two-burmese-children-a-week-conscripted-into-military-7858858.html |accessdate=15 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], who stepped down from her position a week later, met representatives of the [[Government of Myanmar]] on 5 July 2012 and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action plan would &quot;signal a transformation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2012/120705_Guest.doc.htm |title=Press Conference on Action Plan to End Recruitment of Child Soldiers in Myanmar |publisher=United Nations |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the [[Myanmar Armed Forces]] released 42 child soldiers and the [[International Labour Organization]] met with representatives of the government as well as the [[Kachin Independence Army]] to secure the release of more child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ILO in Talks with Kachins over Child Soldiers |author=Weng, Lawi |work=The Irrawaddy|date=5 September 2012 |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/13354 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samantha Power]], a US delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in October 2012.

A ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' article on 23 December 2012 reported that the [[Myanmar Armed Forces]] continued to use child soldiers including during the army's large offensive against the KIA in December 2012.

The [[Rohingya people]] have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied [[Burmese citizenship]] since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law.&lt;ref name=rohingya&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7872635.stm|title=What drive the Rohingya to sea? |publisher=BBC |date=5 February 2009|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Head, Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823, but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws. Naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/burma/burm005-02.htm |title=2000 Human Rights Report III.

Rohingya are also not allowed to travel without official permission, are banned from owning land and are required to sign a commitment to have no more than two children.&lt;ref name=rohingya /&gt; As of July 2012, the Myanmar Government does not include the Rohingya minority group—classified as [[Statelessness|stateless]] Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and, therefore, the government states that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3703383.ece|title=Rohingyas are not citizens: Myanmar minister|date=30 July 2012 |location=Chennai, India|work=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the German professor [[Bassam Tibi]] suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an [[Islamist]] political agenda to impose religious laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bassam |first=T |year=2007 |title=Political Islam, World Politics and Europe: Democratic Peace and EuroIslam versus Global Jihad |location=New York |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while non-religious causes have also been raised, such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]] in World War II—during this time period the British allied themselves with the Rohingya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defeat Into Victory: Battling Japan in Burma and India, 1942–1945|author=Slim, William |year=2009|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=0-330-50997-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fought against the [[State of Burma|puppet government of Burma]] (composed mostly of Bamar Japanese) that helped to establish the [[Tatmadaw]] military organisation that remains in power as of March 2013.

Rohingya have been fleeing [[Rakhine State]] by boat in recent years.  Often, the boats are very small and dangerous on the open seas.

=====2012 Rakhine State riots=====
{{Main|2012 Rakhine State riots}}
A widely publicised Burmese conflict was the [[2012 Rakhine State riots]], a series of conflicts that primarily involved the ethnic [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] Buddhist people and the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslim people in the northern [[Rakhine State]]—an estimated 90,000 people were displaced as a result of the riots.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma unrest: UN body says 90,000 displaced by violence|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18517412|accessdate=27 March 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Burmese Muslims by ethnic Rakhine after the rape and murder of a Rakhine woman as the main cause.&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Lauras |first=Didier |title=Myanmar stung by global censure over unrest |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse in the Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole villages have been &quot;decimated&quot;.&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer /&gt; Over 300 houses and a number of public buildings have been razed.

However, as explained by one editorial in the exiled press ''[[The Irrawaddy]]'', this new &quot;freedom&quot; has caused some Burmese journalists to simply see the new law as an attempt to create an environment of [[self-censorship]] as journalists &quot;are required to follow 16 guidelines towards protecting the three national causes&amp;nbsp;— non-disintegration of the Union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, perpetuation of sovereignty&amp;nbsp;— and &quot;journalistic ethics&quot; to ensure their stories are accurate and do not jeopardise national security.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt; In July 2014 five journalists were sentenced to 10 years in jail after publishing a report saying the country was  planning to build a new chemical weapons plant. Journalists described the jailings as a blow to the recently-won news media freedoms that had followed five decades of censorship and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report on chemical weapons earn Myanmar journalists jail term with hard labour|url=http://www.myanmarnews.net/index.php/sid/223727241/scat/c3891022f175b678/ht/Report-on-chemical-weapons-earn-Myanmar-journalists-jail-term-with-hard-labour|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Myanmar News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at [[Chatham House]], he revealed that &quot;We [Myanmar government] are reviewing all cases.

Myanmar is one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia, suffering from decades of stagnation, mismanagement and isolation. The lack of an educated workforce skilled in modern technology hinders Myanmar's economy, although recent reforms and developments carried out by the new government, in collaboration with foreign countries and organisations aim to make this a thing of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Brown |year=2005 |title=A Colonial Economy In Crisis |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-30580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure. Goods travel primarily across the Thai border (where most illegal drugs are exported) and along the [[Irrawaddy River]]. Railways are old and rudimentary, with few repairs since their construction in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/asia_pacific/burma/upload/chap3.pdf |title=Challenges to Democratization in Burma |accessdate=12 July 2006 |date=November 2001 |format=PDF |publisher=International IDEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highways are normally unpaved, except in the major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;idea&quot; /&gt; Energy shortages are common throughout the country including in [[Yangon]] and only 25% of the country's population has electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma just opened up after 50 years.

[[File:Rijstvelden Myanmar 2006.jpg|thumb|Rice is Myanmar's largest agricultural product.]]

===Economic history===
Under British administration, Myanmar was the second-wealthiest country in South-East Asia. It had been the world's largest exporter of rice. Myanmar also had a wealth of natural and labour resources. [[British Burma]] began exporting [[crude oil]] in 1853, making it one of the earliest petroleum producers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://burma.total.com/myanmar-en/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar-900130.html&lt;/ref&gt; It produced 75% of the world's [[teak]] and had a highly literate population.&lt;ref name=&quot;steinberg&quot; /&gt; The wealth was however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined, and did not recover for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64274.pdf|journal=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research|volume=1|issue=1|date=Spring 2003|issn=1479-8484|title=The Burma Development Disaster in Comparative Historical Perspective|author=Booth, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the British destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister [[U Nu]] embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |accessdate=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San Jose State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]], a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture. The catastrophic programme turned Myanmar into one of the world's most impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruin&quot; /&gt; Myanmar's admittance to [[least developed country]] status by the UN in 1987 highlighted its economic bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026045553/http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm|archivedate=26 October 2013|title=List of Least Developed Countries |publisher=UN-OHRLLS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{Further|Agriculture in Myanmar}}

The major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the [[International Rice Research Institute]] 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19&amp;nbsp;million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.irri.org/media/facts/pdfs/myanmar.pdf Myanmar and IRRI]|21.2&amp;nbsp;KB}}, Facts About Cooperation, International Rice Research Institute.

===Drug production===
Myanmar is also the world's second largest producer of [[opium]], accounting for 25% of entire world production and is a major source of [[illegal drug]]s, including [[amphetamines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/myanmar/myanmar_country_profile_2005.pdf |title=Myanmar Country Profile |accessdate=9 July 2006 |date=December 2005 |format=PDF |work=Office on Drugs and Crime |pages=5–6 |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opium bans implemented since 2002 after international pressure have left ex-poppy farmers without sustainable sources of income in the Kokang and Wa regions. They depend on casual labour for income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/briefing/golden-triangle-rubber-belt Drug Policy Briefing nr.29] of the [[Transnational Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
Myanmar produces precious stones such as [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, [[pearl]]s, and [[jade]]. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and [[hue]]. Thailand buys the majority of the country's [[Gemstone|gems]]. Myanmar's &quot;Valley of Rubies&quot;, the mountainous [[Mogok Township|Mogok]] area, {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]], is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/gemecology/index.html |title=Gems of Burma and their Environmental Impact |publisher=Uvm.edu |accessdate=20 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120214095726/http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/gemecology/index.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many US and European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany, and Cartier, refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/11/11/burma-gem-trade-bolsters-military-regime-fuels-atrocities |title=Burma: Gem Trade Bolsters Military Regime, Fuels Atrocities |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ferro, Shane |date=19 July 2011 |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/38144/burmese-gem-emporium-rakes-in-15-billion-despite-human-rights-abuse-concerns/ |title=Burmese Gem Emporium Rakes in $1.5 Billion Despite Human Rights Abuse Concerns |publisher=Blouin ARTINFO |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products, construction materials, gems, metals, oil and [[natural gas]].

[[Myanmar Engineering Society]] has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to [[Yangon]] which is a significant underutilized resource for electrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DuByne|first=David|title=Geothermal Energy in Myanmar Securing Electricity for Eastern Border Development  |journal=Myanmar Business Today Magazine |date=November 2015|url=http://www.oilseedcrops.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geothermal-Energy-in-Myanmar-Securing-Electricity-for-Eastern-Border-Development-David-DuByne.pdf|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Myanmar}}
[[File:Inle Lake Burma Resort 1.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses at [[Inle Lake]].]]
Since 1992, the government has encouraged tourism in the country; however, fewer than 270,000 tourists entered the country in 2006 according to the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitors By Nationalities|url=http://www.myanmar-tourism.com/key_stat.html|publisher=myanmar-tourism.com|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar's [[Ministry of Hotels and Tourism (Burma)|Minister of Hotels and Tourism]] Saw Lwin has stated that the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Enescu, Raluca  |url=http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/12/24/re.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430235921/http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/12/24/re.htm |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Burma Digest |publisher=Tayzathuria.org.uk |date=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]; religious sites in [[Mon State]], [[Pindaya]], [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] and [[Hpa-An]]; nature trails in [[Inle Lake]], [[Kengtung]], [[Putao]], [[Pyin Oo Lwin]]; ancient cities such as [[Bagan]] and [[Mrauk-U]]; as well as beaches in [[Nabule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernmyanmar.com/beaches-2/|title=Southern Myanmar |page=Tourist Destinations |website=southernmyanmar.com |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ngapali]], [[Ngwe Saung Beach|Ngwe-Saung]], [[Mergui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birma.com/destinations-in-myanmar |title=Myanmar Travel Agency |page=Tourist Destinations |website=birma.com |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny. They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit &quot;unnecessary contact&quot; between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/action_holiday.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429173300/http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/action_holiday.html |archivedate=29 April 2009 |title=The Tourism Campaign&amp;nbsp;– Campaigns |publisher=The Burma Campaign UK |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way for travellers to enter the country seems to be by air.&lt;ref name=LP1&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting there &amp; away|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/myanmar-burma/transport/getting-there-away|publisher=lonelyplanet.com|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the website ''[[Lonely Planet]]'', getting into Myanmar is problematic: &quot;No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border&amp;nbsp;– you must walk across.&quot;, and states that, &quot;It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river.&quot;&lt;ref name=LP1 /&gt; There are a small number of border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles, such as the border between [[Ruili]] (China) to [[Muse, Burma|Mu-se]], the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Ban Phu Nam Ron (Thailand) (the most direct border between [[Dawei]] and [[Kanchanaburi]]), and the border between [[Myawaddy]] (Myanmar) and [[Mae Sot]] (Thailand). At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragoman.com/holidays/details/south-east-asia-between-kunming-and-bangkok-via-burma Dragoman]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;From [[Mae Sai Subdistrict|Mae Sai]] (Thailand) you can cross to [[Tachileik]], but can only go as far as [[Kengtung]]. Those in Thailand on a visa run can cross to [[Kawthaung]] but cannot venture farther into Myanmar.&quot;&lt;ref name=LP1 /&gt;

Flights are available from most countries, though direct flights are limited to mainly Thai and other ASEAN airlines.

===Economic liberalisation, post–2011===
In March 2012, a draft foreign investment law emerged, the first in more than 2 decades.

===Units of measurement===

Myanmar's fertility rate as of 2011 is 2.23, which is slightly above [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement level]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt; and is low compared to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries of similar economic standing, such Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41).&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt; There has been a significant decline in fertility, from a rate of 4.7 children per woman in 1983, down to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national population policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Gavin W. |year=2007 |title=Delayed Marriage and Very Low Fertility in Pacific Asia |journal=Population and Development Review |publisher=The Population Council, Inc. |volume=33 |issue=33 |pages=453–478 |url=http://dahuang.dhxy.info/population/Delayed_Marriage_Fertility09.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2007.00180.x }}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |year=2013 |title=Demographic changes in Myanmar since 1983: An examination of official data |journal=Population and Development Review |publisher=Population Council |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=309–324 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00593.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00593.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mya&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myat |year=2008 |title=The Economic Position of Women in Burma |journal=Asian Studies Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=243–255 |doi=10.1111/1467-8403.00076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fertility rate is much lower in urban areas.

The relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several factors, including extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled among developing countries in the region), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of single, unmarried women of reproductive age, with 25.9% of women aged 30–34 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25–34 single.&lt;ref name=&quot;mya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=mar&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldmarriage/worldmarriagepatterns2000.pdf WorldMarriage Patterns 2000].

These patterns stem from several cultural and economic dynamics. The first is economic hardship, which results in the delay of marriage and family-building;&lt;ref name=&quot;mya&quot; /&gt; the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;mya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=mar /&gt; The second is the social acceptability of [[celibacy]] among the Burmese, who are predominantly Buddhist and value celibacy as a means of spiritual development.&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=Master's |chapter=V: Conclusion and Recommendation |title=The Determinants of Age at First Marriage in Myanmar |url=http://mulinet10.li.mahidol.ac.th/e-thesis/4738657.pdf |author=Nyi, Nyi |year=2005 |publisher=Mahidol University |accessdate=20 September 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethnolinguistic map of Burma 1972 en.svg|thumb|An ethnolinguistic map of Burma.]]

Myanmar is ethnically diverse. The government recognises [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|135 distinct ethnic groups]]. While it is extremely difficult to verify this statement, there are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct [[Tibeto-Burman]] peoples, but with sizeable populations of [[Tai–Kadai-speaking peoples|Tai–Kadai]], Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MM |title=Languages of Myanmar |accessdate=13 January 2007 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mon people|Mon]], who form 2% of the population, are ethno-linguistically related to the [[Khmer people|Khmer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statedept&quot; /&gt; [[Burmese Indians|Overseas Indians]] are 2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;statedept&quot; /&gt; The remainder are [[Kachin people|Kachin]], [[Chin people|Chin]], [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], [[Anglo-Indian]]s, [[Gurkha]], [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] and other ethnic minorities. Included in this group are the [[Anglo-Burmese]]. Once forming a large and influential community, the Anglo-Burmese left the country in steady streams from 1958 onwards, principally to Australia and the UK. It is estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar. {{As of|2009}}, 110,000 Burmese [[refugee]]s were living in refugee camps in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kato|first=Mariko|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/02/18/national/myanmar-refugees-to-try-resettling/ |title=Myanmar refugees to try resettling |work=Japan Times |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refugee camps exist along Indian, Bangladeshi and Thai borders while several thousand are in Malaysia. Conservative estimates state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar, with the majority being [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Red Karen|Karenni]] are principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&amp;id=449676844 |title=Myanmar Refugees in South East Asia |accessdate=13 July 2006 |date=April 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=UNHCR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060621015621/http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&amp;id=449676844 |archivedate=21 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of which were established in the mid-1980s.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Myanmar}}

Myanmar is home to four major language families: [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MM |title=Languages of Myanmar |accessdate=14 July 2006 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], [[Chin people|Chin]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The primary Tai–Kadai language is [[Shan language|Shan]]. [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Palaung language|Palaung]], and [[Va people|Wa]] are the major [[Austroasiatic]] languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are [[Pāli|Pali]], the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethno&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90150 |title=Language Family Trees: Sino-Tibetan |accessdate=9 July 2006 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burmese language|Burmese]], the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[Chinese language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ethno&quot; /&gt; It is written in a [[Burmese script|script]] consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the [[Mon language|Mon script]], which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write [[Pāli|Pali]], the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and [[diacritic]]s for each language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |title=Proposal for encoding characters for Myanmar minority languages in the UCS |accessdate=9 July 2006 |date=2 April 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060723083627/http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese language incorporates widespread usage of [[honorific]]s and is age-oriented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myam-ma&quot; /&gt; Burmese society has traditionally stressed the importance of education. In villages, secular schooling often takes place in [[monastery|monasteries]]. Secondary and tertiary education take place at government schools.

Many religions are practised in Myanmar. Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years. Festivals can be held on a grand scale. The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ethnic and Religious Diversity: Myanmar's Unfolding Nemesis&quot;, Matthews, Bruce, Institute of South East Asian Studies, Visiting Researcher Series, Volume 2001, No. 3. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in Eastern Myanmar, where over 3000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbbc.org/resources.html#reports |title=Internal Displacement in Eastern Burma 2006 Survey |accessdate=4 February 2007 |author=Thailand Burma Border Consortium |year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515121040/http://www.tbbc.org/resources.html |archivedate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Priestly |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5380 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160146/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5380 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |title=The Outsiders |work=[[The Irrawaddy]] |date=17 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isrc.payap.ac.th/document/papers/paper23.pdf |title=The Encounter of Missionary Christianity and Resurgent Buddhism in Post-colonial Myanmar |accessdate=14 July 2006 |author=Ling, Samuel Ngun |year=2003 |format=PDF |publisher=Payap University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302235658/http://isrc.payap.ac.th/document/papers/paper23.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh over the last 20 years to escape [[Islamophobic]] persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zatko|first1=Martin|title=The Rough Guide to Myanmar|date=2015|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dummett |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7019882.stm |title=Burmese exiles in desperate conditions |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pew Research]], 7% of the population identifies as Christian; 4% as Muslim; 1% follows traditional [[animism|animistic]] beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[East Asian religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html#People |title=CIA Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Burma |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90131.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007&amp;nbsp;– Burma |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm |title=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs&amp;nbsp;– Background Note: Burma |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a [[US State Department]]'s 2010 international religious freedom report, official statistics are alleged to underestimate the non-Buddhist population.

Although Hinduism is practised by 2% of the population, it was a major religion in Myanmar's past. Several strains of Hinduism existed alongside both Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism in the Mon and [[Pyu city-states|Pyu period]] in the first millennium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aung-Thwin |first=Michael A. |title=The Mists of Rāmañña: The Legend that was Lower Burma |edition=illustrated |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |year=2005 |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0-8248-2886-8|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and down to the [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan period]] (9th to 13th centuries) when &quot;[[Shaivism|Saivite]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishana]] elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Myanmar}}

The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&amp;subsecID=900003&amp;contentID=254167 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427103224/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&amp;subsecID=900003&amp;contentID=254167 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Myanmar.shtml  |title=Myanmar junta faulted for rampant diseases |date=28 June 2007 |author=Anwar, Yasmin |publisher=UC Berkeley News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.

The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240. This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 47.

Myanmar's government spends the least percentage of its GDP on health care of any country in the world, and international donor organisations give less to Myanmar, per capita, than any other country except India.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090225081933/http://www.msf.org/source/countries/asia/myanmar/2008/PreventableFate/PreventableFatereport.pdf A preventable fate: The failure of ART scale-up in Myanmar].

[[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], recognised as a disease of concern by the [[Ministry of Health (Myanmar)|Burmese Ministry of Health]], is most prevalent among [[sex worker]]s and [[intravenous drug]] users. In 2005, the estimated adult [[HIV/AIDS in Myanmar|HIV prevalence rate in Myanmar]] was 1.3% (200,000–570,000 people), according to [[UNAIDS]], and early indicators of any progress against the HIV epidemic are inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/myanmar_statistics.html#25 |title=At a glance: Myanmar&amp;nbsp;– statistics |accessdate=9 January 2007 |work=UNICEF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/UNA-docs/REPORT_ICAAP_01July05_en.pdf |title=A scaled-up response to AIDS in Asia and the Pacific |accessdate=10 January 2007 |date=1 July 2005 |format=PDF |work=UNAIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;06decUNAIDS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/EpiReport/2006/05-Asia_2006_EpiUpdate_eng.pdf |title=Asia |accessdate=9 January 2007 |format=PDF |work=UNAIDS |date=December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National AIDS Programme Myanmar found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Myanmar have HIV.&lt;ref name=&quot;06decUNAIDS&quot; /&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Myanmar}}

[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Students on their way to school, [[Kalaymyo]], [[Sagaing Region]], Myanmar.]]

According to the [[UNESCO]] Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's official [[literacy rate]] as of 2000 was 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/html/Exceltables/education/Literacy_Regional_April2006.xls|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625071529/http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/html/Exceltables/education/Literacy_Regional_April2006.xls|archivedate=25 June 2007|title=Adult (15+) Literacy Rates and Illiterate Population by Region and Gender for |accessdate=13 July 2006 |date=April 2006 |format=XLS |publisher=UNESCO Institute of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates. To qualify for [[least developed country]] status by the UN to receive debt relief, Myanmar lowered its official literacy rate from 79% to 19% in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Robert I Rotberg |year=1998 |title=Burma: Prospects for a Democratic Future }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=this story is incomplete&amp;nbsp;— and then what? when was it changed back?|date=May 2013}}

The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Ministry of Education]]. The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately about 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.

There are 101 universities, 12 institutes, 9 degree colleges and 24 colleges in Myanmar, a total of 146 higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of National Development Comparison Between Period Preceding 1988 and after (up to 31 December 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 Technical Training Schools, 23 nursing training schools, 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools. There are 2047 Basic Education High Schools, 2605 Basic Education Middle Schools, 29944 Basic Education Primary Schools and 5952 Post Primary Schools. 1692 multimedia classrooms exist within this system.

There are four international schools acknowledged by WASC and College Board—[[The International School Yangon]] (ISY), Crane International School Yangon (CISM), [[Yangon International School]] (YIS) and [[Yangon International Educare Center|International School of Myanmar]] (ISM) in Yangon.

Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of [[opium]] after [[Opium production in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], producing some 25% of the world's opium, and forms part of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Myanmar}}

[[File:Burmese Ramayana dance.jpg|thumb|Burmese [[Kinnara|Kinnayi Kinnaya]] dance]]
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, the majority culture is primarily [[Buddhism in Burma|Buddhist]] and [[Bamar people|Bamar]]. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the ''[[Yama Zatdaw]]'', an adaptation of India's ''[[Ramayana]]'', has been influenced greatly by Thai, [[Mon people|Mon]], and Indian versions of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm |title=Ramayana in Myanmar's heart |accessdate=13 July 2006 |date=13 September 2003 |publisher=Goldenland Pages |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060426233452/http://www.goldenlandpages.com:80/hotspots/rama/rama.htm |archivedate=26 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism is practised along with [[nat (spirit)|nat worship]], which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

However, the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40%, which is implicitly contrasted with CIA report (official US report).

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Burmese cuisine}}

Burmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products like [[fish sauce]] , [[ngapi]] (fermented seafood) and dried prawn.

[[Mohinga]] is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national dish. Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities such as [[Sittwe]], [[Kyaukpyu]], [[Mawlamyaing]] (formerly Moulmein), [[Mergui]] (Myeik) and [[Dawei]], while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like [[Mandalay]]. Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed.

Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (''[[a thoke]]''), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, [[kaffir lime]], long bean, [[lahpet]] (pickled tea leaves), and [[ngapi]] (fish paste).

===Art===
{{Main|Burmese contemporary art}}
Burmese [[contemporary art]] has developed rather on its own terms and quite rapidly.

One of the first to study western art was [[Ba Nyan]]. Together with [[Ngwe Gaing]] and a handful of other artists, they were pioneers of western painting style in Myanmar. Later, most of the students learnt from masters through apprenticeship. Some well known contemporary artists are [[Lun Gywe]], Aung Kyaw Htet, [[MPP Yei Myint]], Myint Swe, Min Wai Aung, [[Aung Myint]], [[Khin Maung Yin]], [[Po Po]] and [[Zaw Zaw Aung]].

Most of the young artists who were born in the 1980s have greater chances of art practises inside and outside the country. Performance art is a popular genre among Burmese young artists.

===Media and communications===
{{Main|Media of Myanmar}}
Due to Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population, although a certain number exists. Some are privately owned. All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board.

The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it will stop censoring media before publication. Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma Abolishes Censorship|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/08/20/burma-abolishes-censorship.html |work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012. For the first time in numerous decades, the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar shows new signs of press freedom|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia/2013/04/201341115227284132.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=1 April 2013|author=Sukri, Azhar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to communications infrastructure, Myanmar is the last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. With 148 countries reported on, Myanmar ranked number 146 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf |title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No data is currently available for previous years.

===Film===
{{Main|Cinema of Myanmar}}
Myanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein&amp;nbsp;— a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in [[London]]. The first Burmese [[silent film]] Myitta Ne Thuya ([[Love and Liquor]]) in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera position and inadequate film accessories. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese [[sound film]] was produced in 1932 in [[Bombay]], [[India]] with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It). After [[World War II]], Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early [[Cold War]] era had a strong propaganda element to them.

In the era that followed the [[8888 Uprising|political events of 1988]], the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films. The government issues strict rules on [[censorship]] and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zaw, Aung |title=Celluloid Disillusions|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2004/vol12.3/cover.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213182520/http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2004/vol12.3/cover.html|archivedate=13 February 2005|journal=Irrawaddy|volume=12|issue=3|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower budget [[direct-to-video]] films.

Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies.&lt;ref&gt;Kyi Soe Tun quoted in the Bangkok Post, 11 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20120328075748/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14937 Through the Director’s Lens].

Myanmar is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled ''Chroniques Birmanes'' by [[Quebec City|Québécois]] author and animator, [[Guy Delisle]]. The graphic novel was translated into English under the title ''[[Burma Chronicles]]'' in 2008. In 2009, a documentary about Burmese [[videojournalist]]s called ''[[Burma VJ]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://burmavjmovie.com/ |title=Burma VJ&amp;nbsp;– Academy Award Nominee&amp;nbsp;– Best Documentary Feature |publisher=Burmavjmovie.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards|2010 Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dannyfisher.org/2010/02/02/burma-vj-nominated-for-a-2010-academy-award-for-best-documentary-feature/ |title=Burma VJ Nominated for the 2010 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Rev.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is extremely rich in natural resources, but political instability, a lack of infrastructure, deep rooted corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation have limited holistic development. Besides the capital, [[Kinshasa]], the other major cities, [[Lubumbashi]] and [[Mbuji-Mayi]], are both mining communities. DR Congo's largest export is raw minerals, with China accepting over 50% of DRC's exports in 2012. As of 2013, according to the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), DR Congo has a low level of human development, ranking 176 out of 187 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2015_statistical_annex.pdf |title=2015 Human Development Report  |year=2015 |accessdate=14 December 2015 |publisher=United Nations Development Programme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{further|Name of the Congo}}
The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly known as, in chronological order, [[Congo Free State]], [[Belgian Congo]], [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)]], [[Republic of Zaire]] and Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

The country was known officially as the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot; from 1965 to 1971, when it was changed to the &quot;Republic of Zaïre.&quot; In 1992, the Sovereign National Conference voted to change the name of the country to the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo,&quot; but the change was not put into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nzongola-Ntalaja, Georges |title=From Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvjNXc0tsyEC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2004|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-538-4|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's name was restored by former president [[Laurent Kabila]] following the fall of long time dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yusuf, A.

[[File:Nyangwe.jpg|thumb|Village attacked by Arab-Swahili slavers near [[Nyangwe]], end of 19th century]]

The area now known as the DR Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at Katanda, one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, and which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |title=Katanda Bone Harpoon Point &amp;#124; The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program |publisher=Humanorigins.si.edu |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021659928822 |title=Barbed Bone Points: Tradition and Continuity in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Springerlink.com |date=1 September 1998 |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians think that [[Bantu peoples]] began settling in the extreme northwest of Central Africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward.

Their propagation was accelerated by the transition from [[Stone Age]] to [[Iron Age]] techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were mostly [[Bushmen|San Bushmen]] and hunter-gatherer groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and [[animal husbandry]]. This led to the displacement of the [[hunter-gatherer]] groups in the east and southeast.

The 10th century marked the [[Bantu expansion|final expansion of the Bantu]] in West-Central Africa. Rising populations soon made possible intricate local, regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in salt, iron and copper.

===Congo Free State (1877–1908)===

[[Belgian Congo|Belgian exploration]] and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of [[King Leopold II of Belgium]]. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from Arab–Swahili [[Arab slave trade|slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml The East African slave trade].

Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the [[Conference of Berlin]] in 1885 and made the land his private property and named it the Congo Free State.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfskeyes&quot;/&gt; Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|railway that ran from the coast to the capital]] of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). It took eight years to complete. Nearly all such projects were aimed at increasing the assets which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;[[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild, Adam]]. ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999; ISBN 0-547-52573-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Free State, colonists brutalized the local population to produce rubber, for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. The sale of rubber made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'', was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;google748&quot;&gt;Fage, John D.

During the period of 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower [[Congo River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google748&quot;/&gt; A government commission later concluded that the population of the Congo had been &quot;reduced by half&quot; during this period,&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; but determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

===Belgian Congo (1908–1960)===
{{Main|Belgian Congo}}
In 1908, the Belgian parliament, despite initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially that from the United Kingdom) and took over the Free State from [[King Leopold II]]. On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. Executive power rested with the Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels) and the Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo. In 1926, the colonial capital moved from Boma to Léopoldville, some 300&amp;nbsp;km further upstream in the interior.

The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a break but it was also marked by a large degree of continuity. The last Governor-general of the Congo Free State, Baron Wahis, remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II’s administration with him.&lt;ref&gt;Stengers, Jean (2005), ''Congo: Mythes et réalités'', Brussels: Editions Racine.&lt;/ref&gt; Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches for the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion – however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.
[[File:Congo belge campagne 1918.jpg|thumb|[[Force Publique]] soldiers in the Belgian Congo in 1918. At its peak, the Force Publique had around 19,000 African soldiers, led by 420 white officers.]]
Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and one of indigenous courts, ''tribunaux indigènes''). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. In 1936 it was recorded that there were 728 Belgian administrators controlling the Colony. No political activity was permitted in the Congo whatsoever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meredith|first=Martin|title=The Fate of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Force Publique]]'', a locally recruited army under Belgian command, put down any attempts at rebellion.

The Belgian population of the colony increased from 1,928 in 1910 to nearly 89,000 in 1959.

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During [[World War I]], an initial stand-off between the ''Force Publique'' and the German colonial army in German East Africa (Tanganyika) turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]]. The ''Force Publique'' gained a notable victory when it marched into [[Tabora]] in September 1916, under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] after heavy fighting.

After the war, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the ''Force Publique'' in the East African campaign with a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the former German colony of Ruanda-Urundi. During [[World War II]], the Belgian Congo was a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London. The ''Force Publique'' again participated in the Allied campaigns in Africa. Belgian Congolese forces under the command of Belgian officers notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Ethiopia in [[Asosa]], [[Bortaï]] and [[Saïo]] under Major-General [[Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert]] during the second [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=McCrummen|first=Stephanie|title=Nearly Forgotten Forces of WWII|agency=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=4 August 2009|work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/03/AR2009080302959.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence and political crisis (1960–1965)===
{{Main|Congo Crisis}}

[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|[[Patrice Lumumba]] was the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.]]
In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] or MNC Party, led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the parliamentary elections. Patrice Lumumba thus became the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The parliament elected as President [[Joseph Kasavubu]], of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (or PSA) led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple (or PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]]. (Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium).

The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name &quot;République du Congo&quot; (&quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot; in English). Shortly after independence, the provinces of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] (led by [[Moise Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html Jungle Shipwreck]&quot;, ''Time'', 25 July 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm|title=The United Nations and the Congo |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk|date=30 March 2007|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/4/6/0/pages254609/p254609-19.php &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;], allacademic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

As the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as &quot;Congo-Léopoldville&quot; and &quot;Congo-Brazzaville&quot;, after their capital cities.

On 5 September 1960, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared Kasavubu's action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed. (cf. ''Sécession au Katanga'' – J.Gerald-Libois -Brussels- CRISP)

On 14 September, Lumumba was arrested by forces loyal to [[Joseph Mobutu]]. On 17 January 1961, he was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgian-led Katangese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/21/patrice_lumumba_50_years_later_remembering|title=Patrice Lumumba: 50 Years Later, Remembering the U.S.-Backed Assassination of Congo’s First Democratically Elected Leader|work=Democracy Now!|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (Collège des Commissaires) with [[Evariste Kimba]]. The Katanga secession was ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments, of [[Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]] and Moise Tshombe, took over in quick succession.

Lumumba had previously appointed [[Joseph Mobutu]] chief of staff of the new Congo army, [[Military of the Democratic Republic of Congo|Armée Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Lumumba, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to maintain &quot;order&quot; in the new state by neutralizing Kasavubu and Lumumba in a [[coup d'état|coup]] by proxy. A [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum, 1964|constitutional referendum]] after Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the country's official name being changed to the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to &quot;Republic of Zaïre&quot;.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payanzo|first1=Ntsomo|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zaïre (1971–1997)===
{{Main|Zaïre}}

[[File:Mobutu Nixon.gif|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C., 1973.]]
The new president had the support of the United States because of his staunch [[Anti-communism|opposition]] to Communism, believing that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A one-party system was established, and Mobutu declared himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe human rights violations, political repression, a [[cult of personality]] and corruption.

Corruption became so prevalent the term &quot;le mal Zairois&quot; or &quot;Zaïrean Sickness&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html|title=&quot;Zaïre: The Hoax of Independence&quot;, The Aida Parker Newsletter #203, 4 August 1997|publisher=cycad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Young, C. &amp; Turner, T. (1985) ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State'', p. 74; ISBN 978-0-299-10110-7&lt;/ref&gt;  International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaïre became a &quot;[[kleptocracy]]&quot; as Mobutu and his associates [[embezzlement|embezzled]] government funds.

In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became [[Kinshasa]] [the country was now Democratic Republic of The Congo&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;Kinshasa], Stanleyville became [[Kisangani]], Elisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]], and Coquilhatville became [[Mbandaka]]. This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s.

In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaïre'', its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaïre River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Johns, Michael (29 June 1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060715000000/http://www.heritage.org/research/africa/upload/91612_1.pdf &quot;Zaïre's Mobutu Visits America&quot;], Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #239.&lt;!-- date?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally. Opponents within Zaïre stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee Zaire, in 1997.

===Civil wars (1996–present)===
{{Main|First Congo War|Second Congo War|Kivu Conflict}}

[[File:DRC Rwanda line.jpg|thumb|Civilians waiting to cross the DRC-Rwanda border (2001). By 2008 the [[Second Congo War]] and its aftermath had killed 5.4&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;

By 1996, following the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide]] and the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government in Rwanda, Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) fled to eastern Zaïre and used refugee camps as a base for incursion against Rwanda. They allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaïre.&lt;ref&gt;Thom, William G. [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060821184303/http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/bin/get5.cgi?directory=fall99/&amp;filename=THOM.htm &quot;Congo-Zaïre's 1996–97 civil war in the context of evolving patterns of military conflict in Africa in the era of independence&quot;], ''Conflict Studies Journal at the University of New Brunswick'', Vol. XIX No. 2, Fall 1999.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaïre to overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately to control the mineral resources of Zaïre, launching the [[First Congo War]]. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the [[Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre]] (AFDL). In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries—he had concerns that the Rwandan officers running his army were plotting a coup in order to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to the Rwandan president, [[Paul Kagame]]. Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new Tutsi-led rebel military movement called the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] (RCD) to fight against Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]. The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the [[Second Congo War]] by attacking the DRC army in 1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian militaries entered on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son, [[Joseph Kabila]], succeeded him and called for multilateral peace-talks. UN peacekeepers, [[MONUC]], now known as MONUSCO, arrived in April 2001. Talks led to the signing of a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. A [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] was set up until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters, and on 30 July 2006 DRC held its [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first multi-party elections]]. An election-result dispute between Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba turned into an all-out battle between their supporters in the streets of [[Kinshasa]]. MONUC took control of the city. A new election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and on December 2006 he was sworn in as President.

However, [[Laurent Nkunda]], a member of an RCD branch integrated to the army, [[RCD-Goma]], defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (CNDP), which began an armed rebellion against the government, starting the [[Kivu conflict]]. They were believed{{by whom|date=May 2015}} to be again backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the Hutu group, [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR). In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-U_1NZdVdXyssb9DPt47IHx7j7Q|title=DR Congo government, CNDP rebels 'sign peace deal'|date=23 March 2012|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|accessdate=18 November 2012|archivedate=18 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CKVBitcD|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the leader of the CNDP, [[Bosco Ntaganda]], and troops loyal to him, mutinied and formed the rebel military [[March 23 Movement]], claiming a violation of the treaty by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201204040870.html|title=Congo-Kinshasa: General Ntaganda and Loyalists Desert Armed Forces|first=Melanie|last=Gouby|date=4 April 2012|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=18 November 2012|archivedate=18 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CKVC5lJo|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[2015 Congolese protests|major protests]] broke out across the country and protesters demanded that [[Joseph Kabila]] step down as President. The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that, if also passed by the Congolese upper house, would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted (a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections, which he is constitutionally barred from participating in).

This bill passed; however, it was gutted of the provision that would keep Joseph Kabila in power until a census took place.  A census is supposed to take place, but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place.  {{As of |2015}} elections are scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace holds over the Congo.

==Geography==
[[File:Cg-map.png|thumb|right|The map of Democratic Republic of Congo]]
{{Main|Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is located in central [[sub-Saharan Africa]], bounded by (clockwise from the southwest) [[Angola]], the South Atlantic Ocean, the [[Republic of Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[South Sudan]], Uganda, [[Rwanda]], Burundi, [[Tanzania]] across [[Lake Tanganyika]], and [[Zambia]]. The country lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°N]] and [[14th parallel south|14°S]], and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[32nd meridian east|32°E]]. It straddles the [[Equator]], with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of Congo, {{convert|2345408|km2|sqmi}}, is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway.

As a result of its equatorial location, the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of {{convert|2000|mm|in|disp=5}} in some places, and the area sustains the [[Congo Rainforest]], the second largest rain forest in the world (after the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]). This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central [[drainage basin|basin]] of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense grasslands extending beyond the [[Congo River]] in the north. High, glaciated mountains are found in the extreme eastern region ([[Rwenzori Mountains]]). {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The [[tropical climate]] has also produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The river and its tributaries (major offshoots include the [[Kasai River|Kasai]], [[Sangha]], [[Ubangi River|Ubangi]], Ruzizi River (Kivu), [[Aruwimi]], and [[Lulonga River|Lulonga]]) form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation.

The sources of the Congo are in the [[Albertine Rift Mountains]] that flank the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], as well as [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Mweru]]. The river flows generally west from [[Kisangani]] just below [[Boyoma Falls]], then gradually bends southwest, passing by [[Mbandaka]], joining with the [[Ubangi River]], and running into the [[Pool Malebo]] (Stanley Pool). [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]] are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool (see NASA image). Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the [[Livingstone Falls]]), and then running past [[Boma, Congo|Boma]] into the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest [[drainage basin|watershed]] of any river in the world (trailing the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] in both respects). The river and a 37&amp;nbsp;km wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country's only outlet to the Atlantic. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The previously mentioned [[Albertine Rift]] plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the rift's [[tectonics|tectonic]] activities, this area also experiences [[volcanic]] activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the famous [[African Great Lakes]], three of which lie on the Congo's eastern frontier: [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] (known during the Mobutu era as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko), Lake Kivu (Unknown until late 1712), [[Lake Edward]] (known during the [[Idi Amin|Amin]] era as Lake Idi Amin Dada), and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. Lake Edward and Lake Albert are connected by the [[Semliki River]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The [[Rift valley]] has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. [[Cobalt]], copper, [[cadmium]], industrial and gem-quality [[diamonds]], gold, silver, [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[tin]], [[germanium]], [[uranium]], [[radium]], [[bauxite]], iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern Katanga region. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:La rivière Lulilaka, parc national de Salonga, 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Salonga National Park]].]]
On 17 January 2002 [[Mount Nyiragongo]] erupted in Congo, with the lava running out at 64&amp;nbsp;km/h (40&amp;nbsp;mph) and 46 m (50 yards) wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of [[Goma]], killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava poisoned the water of [[Lake Kivu]], killing fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, entrapping several airplanes. Six months after the 2002 eruption, nearby [[Mount Nyamulagira]] also erupted. Mount Nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The 2006 [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|constitution]] mandated an [[Proposed provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|increase in the number of provinces to 26]] but these changes have not yet been implemented. On 2 March 2015 President Kabila imposed a 120-day deadline for its implementation ({{lang-fr|découpage}}). Several regions have resisted the changes and some commentators have accused Kabila of using ''découpage'' as a ploy to delay upcoming elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wille |first=Christoph |date=21 May 2015 |title=Carving Up Congo:President Kabila's Latest Ploy to Stay in Power |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/democratic-republic-congo/2015-05-21/carving-congo |newspaper=[[Foreign Affairs]] |location=|access-date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pham |first=J.

===Flora and fauna===
{{Main|Wildlife of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The [[rainforest]]s of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great [[biodiversity]], including many rare and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, such as the [[common chimpanzee]] and the [[bonobo]], the [[African forest elephant]], [[mountain gorilla]], [[okapi]] and [[white rhino]]. Five of the country's [[national park]]s are listed as [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Garamba National Park|Garumba]], [[Kahuzi-Biega National Park|Kahuzi-Biega]], [[Salonga National Park|Salonga]] and [[Virunga National Park]]s, and the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]].
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html|title=Lambertini, A Naturalist's Guide to the Tropics, excerpt|accessdate=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity. Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work. All five sites are listed by [[UNESCO]] as World Heritage in Danger. Over the past century or so, the DRC has developed into the center of what has been called the Central African &quot;[[bushmeat]]&quot; problem, which is regarded by many as a major environmental as well as socio-economic crisis. &quot;Bushmeat&quot; is another word for the meat of wild animals. It is typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with shotguns, poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bas-congo.JPG|[[Bas-Congo]] landscape
File:Male gorilla in SF zoo.jpg|A male [[Western gorilla]]
File:Hippo pod edit.jpg|[[Hippopotamus]]
File:African Forest Elephant.jpg|The [[African forest elephant]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[bushmeat]] crisis has emerged in the DRC mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it. A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions has forced many Congolese to become dependent on bushmeat, either as a means of acquiring income (hunting the meat and selling), or are dependent on it for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of [[Kinshasa]] into the prime market for commercial bushmeat. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

This combination has caused not only widespread endangerment of local fauna, but has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's rainforests (from corporate logging, in addition to farmers clearing out forest for agriculture), which allows hunters much easier access to previously unreachable jungle terrain, while simultaneously eroding away at the [[habitats]] of animals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050908074106/http://www.bushmeat.org/pdf/19%20May%2001%20AM%2001%20Policy-Fotabong%20and%20Gartlan.pdf &quot;The Bushman crisis: long term solutions – international, national and local policies&quot;], ''[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deforestation]] is accelerating in Central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaja, Abiose [http://www.scidev.net/global/policy/news/deforestation-accelerating-in-central-africa.html Deforestation accelerating in Central Africa], scidev.net, 8 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A case that has particularly alarmed conservationists is that of [[primates]]. The Congo is inhabited by several [[great ape]] species&amp;nbsp; — the [[common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes''), the [[bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus''), the [[eastern gorilla]] (''Gorilla beringei''), and possibly the [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9404/0 Gorilla gorilla] IUCN Red List&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee, the bonobo and the gorilla, each of whose population once numbered in the millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000&lt;ref name=&quot;gorillas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=556&amp;ArticleID=6033&amp;l=en&amp;t=long|title=Gorillas on Thin Ice|date=15 January 2009|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; gorillas, 100,000&lt;ref name=&quot;chimpanzees&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vigilant, Linda|year=2004|title=Chimpanzees|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=10|pages=R369–R371|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.05.006|pmid=15186757}}&lt;/ref&gt; chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000&lt;ref name=&quot;chimpanzees&quot;/&gt; bonobos.

==Politics==

===Government===
{{Main|Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

[[File:Joseph kabila.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Kabila]] has been President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since January 2001.]]
After a four-year interlude between two constitutions, with new political institutions established at the various levels of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable [[presidential system|presidential]] [[democratic republic]].
The 2003 transitional constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[s:fr:Constitution de la transition de la République démocratique du Congo (2003)|Full text of constitution (in French)]]&lt;/ref&gt; had established a parliament with a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, consisting of a [[Senate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Senate]] and a [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|National Assembly]].

The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly.

The government&amp;nbsp;– not the President&amp;nbsp;– is responsible to the Parliament. The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments, creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the [[Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congo (Democratic Republic of the) 2005 (rev. 2011)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_2011?lang=en#940|website=Constitute|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although located in the Central African [[United Nations geoscheme|UN subregion]], the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member States |work=Southern African Development Community: Towards a common future |url=http://www.sadc.int/member-states }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption===
Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the DRC, which he renamed [[Zaire|Zaïre]], from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: &quot;Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out ten. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine.&quot;&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Arnold M.|year=2002|title=King of the Mountain: The Nature of Political Leadership|page=72|isbn=0-8131-2233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to an [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#1990s|economic collapse in 1996]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Nafziger|first=E.

According to Yakin Ertürk, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] on Violence against Women who toured eastern Congo in July 2007, violence against women in North and South Kivu included 'unimaginable brutality'. &quot;Armed groups attack local communities, loot, rape, kidnap women and children, and make them work as sexual slaves&quot;, Ertürk added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/73524/drc-pendulum-displacement-in-the-kivus|title=DRC: 'Pendulum displacement' in the Kivus|date=1 August 2007|agency=IRIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 GuardianFilms of ''[[The Guardian]]'' released a film documenting the testimony of over 400 women and girls who had been abused by marauding militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/dec/05/congo|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Rape in a lawless land|first=Christian|last=Bennett|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China, India, Russia, Brazil and other [[Developing country|developing countries]] require that [[Developed country|developed countries]] employ new, integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring, on a continual basis, an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs. Highlighting the DR Congo's importance to United States national security, the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the U.S. to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

There are economic and strategic incentives to bringing more security to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as [[cobalt]]. Cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many diverse industrial and military applications. The largest use of cobalt is in [[superalloy]]s, which are used to make [[jet engine]] parts. Cobalt is also used in [[magnetic alloy]]s and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented [[carbide]]s. The [[chemical industry]] consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain enamels; decolourisers for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics, paints, and plastics. The country contains 80% of the world's cobalt reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vandiver, John|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/gis-retrain-congo-troops-known-for-being-violent-1.101774|title=An April 2009 report to Congress by the National Defense Stockpile Center|publisher=Stripes.com|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coltan mines are small, and non-mechanized.

Despite such vast mineral wealth, the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. The African country generated up to 70% of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s, and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time. By 2005, 90% of the DRC's revenues derived from its minerals (Exenberger and Hartmann 2007:10).&lt;ref name=ExenbergerHartmann2007&gt;

The DRC is also one of the twenty lowest ranked countries on the [[Corruption Perception Index]].

===Mining===
{{main|Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Diamonds- Zaire, (DR Congo) (8458935824).jpg|thumb|Rough diamonds ~1 to 1.5 mm in size from DR Congo.]]
The Congo is the world's largest producer of [[cobalt]] ore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/cobalt/cobalt_t8.html|title=Cobalt: World Mine Production, By Country|accessdate=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a major producer of copper and diamonds, the latter coming from the Kasai province in the West. By far the largest mines in the Congo are located in the Katanga (formerly Shaba) province in the south, and are highly mechanized, with a maximum capacity of several millions of tons per year of copper and cobalt ore, and with the capability of refining it into metal. In terms of annual carats produced, the DRC is the second largest diamond-producing nation in the world, with artisanal and small-scale miners accounting for most production.

At the time of its independence in 1960, DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa; it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091125042436/http://www.societecivile.cd/node/4243 Province orientale: le diamant et l'or quelle part dans la reconstruction socio – économique de la Province?] (in French) @ societecivile.cd, 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The two recent conflicts (the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have increased external debt, and have resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war, and associated [[famine]] and disease. [[Malnutrition]] affects approximately two thirds of the country's population. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The war has intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.

Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Joseph Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data. A [[United Nations Human Development Index]] report shows human development to be one of the worst in decades. Through 2011 the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries, classified lower than [[Niger]] despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country from 2010's numbers. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In September 2004 the state-owned [[Gécamines]], signed an agreement with Global Enterprises Corporate (GEC), a company formed by the merging of [[Dan Gertler|Dan Gertler International]] in partnership with [[Beny Steinmetz Global]], to rehabilitate and operate the [[Kananga Mine|Kananga]] and [[Tilwezembe Mine|Tilwezembe]] copper mines. The deal was ratified by presidential decree. In 2007 a World Bank report reviewed The Democratic Republic of Congo's three biggest mining contracts finding that the 2005 deals including one with [[Global Enterprises Company]], a company co-owned by Dan Getler, were approved with &quot;a complete lack of transparency&quot; (Mahtani, 3 January 2007).&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes20070103&gt;{{cite news|magazine=Financial Times|author=Mahtani, Dino |date=3 January 2007|title=Transparency fears lead to review of Congo contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sergeant20070403&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineweb.com/archive/nikanors-drc-mining-contract-quandary/|title=Nikanor's DRC mining contract quandary|author=Sergeant, Barry |date=3 April 2007|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006 Gertler's DGI took a major stake in DEM Mining, a cobalt-copper mining and services company based in Katanga.&lt;ref name=Sergeant20070403/&gt; In June 2006 Gertler bought [[Tremalt]], which had a half share in the [[Mukondo Mine]] for about $60m from the Zimbabwean businessman [[John Bredenkamp]]. In 2007 Tremalt was owned by Prairie International Ltd, of which Dan Gertler's family trust was a major shareholder. Tremalt owned 80% of Savannah Mining, which held concessions C17 and C18 in Katanga Province and 50% of the Mukondo project. The other 50% of Mukonda was held by Boss Mining, which in turn was 80% owned by [[Central African Mining &amp; Exploration Company]] (CAMEC). Boss Mining had rented and operated Bredenkamp's half of Mukondo. Gertler terminated this arrangement.&lt;ref name=Sergeant20070403/&gt;

[[Katanga Mining|Katanga Mining Limited]], a Swiss-owned company, owns the Luilu Metallurgical Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and 8,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world. After a major rehabilitation program, the company restarted copper production in December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katangamining.com/media/news-releases/2008/2008-08-12.aspx|title=Katanga Project Update and 2Q 2008 Financials, Katanga Mining Limited, 12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, anti-corruption NGOs revealed that tax authorities in the country had failed to account for $88 million from the mining sector, despite booming production figures and positive industrial performance. The missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have reportedly paid them into the central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/watchdog-says-88m-missing-in-congolese-mining-taxes-2013-04-16|title=Watchdog says $88m missing in Congolese mining taxes|year=2013|work=[[Mining Weekly]]|publication-place=South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2013 the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] suspended the country as a candidate for membership due to insufficient reporting, monitoring and independence of audits. In July 2013 the country improved its accounting and transparency to the point where the EITI gave the country full membership.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:First train in Kindu, DRC.jpg|thumb|right|Train from [[Lubumbashi]] arriving in [[Kindu]] on a newly refurbished line.]]
Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the [[Congo Basin]] present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflicts have led to long-term under-investment.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Train rdc.svg|300px|thumb|right|Map of rail network]]
Rail transportation is provided by the [[Congo Railroad Company]] (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo) and the [[Office National des Transports (Congo)]] (ONATRA) and the Office of the Uele Railways (Office des Chemins de fer des Ueles, CFU).

====Road====
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa — a total of 2250&amp;nbsp;km, of which only 1226&amp;nbsp;km is in good condition (see below). To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500&amp;nbsp;km (e.g. Matadi to Lubumbushi, 2700&amp;nbsp;km by road). The figure of 2250&amp;nbsp;km converts to 35&amp;nbsp;km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population. Comparative figures for Zambia and Botswana are 721&amp;nbsp;km and 3427&amp;nbsp;km respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The figures are obtained by dividing the population figures in the Wikipedia country articles by the paved roads figure in the 'Transport in [country]' articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three routes in the [[Trans-African Highway network]] pass through DR Congo:
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]: this route crosses the western extremity of the country on National Road No. 1 between Kinshasa and [[Matadi]], a distance of 285&amp;nbsp;km on one of the only paved sections in fair condition.
* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]: the DR Congo is the main missing link in this east-west highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function.
* [[Beira-Lobito Highway]]: this east-west highway crosses [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and requires re-construction over most of its length, being an earth track between the Angolan border and [[Kolwezi]], a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and [[Lubumbashi]], and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the Zambian border.

====Water====
The Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of [[navigable]] [[waterway]]s, and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.

====Air====
As of April 2014 DR Congo had two major national airlines ([[Compagnie Africaine d'Aviation|CAA]] and [[Korongo Airlines]]) which offered flights inside DR Congo and to a small number of international locations. [[Korongo Airlines]] was based in Lumbumbashi and [[Compagnie Africaine d'Aviation|CAA]] was based in Kinshasa but both airlines operated many of the same flight routes. Several international airlines offer flights to the country's two international airports [[N'djili Airport|Kinshasa (Ndjili) International Airport (FIH)]] and [[Lubumbashi International Airport]]. All air carriers certified by the DRC have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission, due to inadequate safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110430124922/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf List of airlines banned within the EU], Official EC list, updated 20 April 2011.

===Migration===
[[File:Opening ceremony of new PNC headquarters in Goma (7134901927).jpg|thumb|Population fleeing their villages due to fighting between FARDC and rebels groups, Sake North Kivu 30 April 2012]]
Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes Region]] – constituting an important subset of the population in the country. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMProfile&quot;/&gt;

Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of immigrants in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Official figures are unavailable on migrant workers, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMProfile&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=41_42&amp;products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en République Démocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe. The DRC has produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of whom were living in other African countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMProfile&quot;/&gt;&gt;

Since 2003, more than 400,000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from [[Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/05/calls-for-angola-to-investigate-abuse-of-congolese-migrants &quot;Calls for Angola to Investigate Abuse of Congolese Migrants&quot;], Inter Press Service. 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity is the majority religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by about 95% of the population according to [[Pew Research Center]]&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-percentages/|title=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 estimate, and 80% according to [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; and [[Pew Research Center]] 2013 data.&lt;ref name=&quot;religion2&quot;/&gt; Indigenous beliefs accounts for about 1.8–10%, and Islam for 10–12%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;religion2&quot;/&gt;

There are about 35 million Catholics in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; There are six [[archdiocese]]s and 41 [[dioceses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|qview5|Structured View of Dioceses|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo is difficult to overestimate. Schatzberg has called it the country's &quot;only truly national institution apart from the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schatzberg, Michael G (February 1980) Politics and Class in Zaire: Bureaucracy, Business and Beer in Lisala, Africana Pub.

The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals, schools, and clinics, as well as many diocesan economic enterprises, including farms, ranches, stores, and artisans' shops. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[Kimbanguism]] was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians. Kimbanguism, officially &quot;the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu&quot;, now has about three million members,&lt;ref name=Adherents&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20010707120530/http://www.adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_365.html &quot;Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo)&quot;, Adherents.com – Religion by Location.] Sources quoted are ''The World Factbook'' (1998), 'official government web site' of ''Democratic Republic of Congo''.

Sixty-two of the Protestant denominations in the country are federated under the umbrella of the [[Church of Christ in Congo]]. It is often simply referred to as ''the Protestant Church'', since it covers most of the DRC Protestants. With more than 25 million members, it constitutes [[List of the largest Protestant churches|one of the largest Protestant bodies]] in the world.

The first members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later the first local administrative council was elected. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly (national administrative council) was first elected.  Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments, the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s. In 2012 plans were announced to build a national [[Baha'i House of Worship]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahaiwritings.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ridvan-message-2012.pdf Ridvan Message 2012]. p. 3.

Traditional religions embody such concepts as [[monotheism]], [[animism]], [[vitalism]], [[spirit worship|spirit]] and [[ancestor worship]], [[witchcraft]], and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups. The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity. New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread, led by US-inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderly.{{Clarify|reason=What is the new belief?

The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft) and can lead to physical violence against these children.{{Clarify|reason=What leads to violence?|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Democratic Republic of the Congo|work=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|publisher=US Department of State|year=2011|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154340.htm|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-denominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for [[exorcisms]].

===Languages===
[[File:Map - DR Congo, major languages.svg|thumb|Major Bantu languages in the Congo]]
{{Main|Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
French is the [[official language]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is culturally accepted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo. According to the 2014 [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] report, 33 million Congolese people (47% of the population) can read and write French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] |title=La langue française dans le monde 2014 |url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/ |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Nathan |page=17 |date=2014 |isbn=978-2-09-882654-0 |access-date=2015-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital city [[Kinshasa]], 67% of the population can read and write French, and 68.5% can speak and understand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] |title=La langue française dans le monde 2014 |url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/ |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Nathan |page=30 |date=2014 |isbn=978-2-09-882654-0 |access-date=2015-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country, but only four have the status of national languages: [[Kituba language|Kituba]] (&quot;Kikongo ya leta&quot;), [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]], and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language. Lingala was made the official language of the colonial army, the &quot;[[Force Publique]]&quot;, under Belgian colonial rule, and it remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces. Since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent.

When the country was a Belgian colony, the Belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. This trend was reversed after independence with French made the sole language of education at all levels.&lt;ref name=lang_educ&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] |title=La langue française dans le monde 2014 |url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/ |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Nathan |page=117 |date=2014 |isbn=978-2-09-882654-0 |access-date=2015-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1975, the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education, with French becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards, but in practice many primary schools in urban areas use solely French since the 1st year of education.&lt;ref name=lang_educ /&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

[[File:Hemba male figure1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Hemba]] male statue]]
The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s and their differing ways of life throughout the country&amp;nbsp; — from the mouth of the [[Congo River|River Congo]] on the coast, upriver through the [[rainforest]] and [[savanna]] in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by [[colonialism]], the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s. Despite these pressures, the [[convention (norm)|customs]] and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country's 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural. The 30% who live in urban areas have been the most open to [[Western culture|Western]] influences.

===Music===
Another notable feature in Congo culture is its music. The DRC has blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], and [[merengue music|merengue]] to give birth to [[soukous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEeTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|author=Stone, Ruth M. |title=The Garland Handbook of African Music |page=133 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other African nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous. Some of the African bands sing in [[Lingala]], one of the main languages in the DRC. The same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of &quot;le sapeur&quot;, [[Papa Wemba]], has set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designers' clothes, they came to be known as the 4th generation of Congolese music and they mostly come from the former well-known band Wenge Musica. The Congo is also known for its art. Traditional art includes masks and wooden statues.

===Sports===
Many sports are played in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including [[Football in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|football]], basketball and [[Rugby union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|rugby]]. The sports are played in numerous stadiums throughout the country, including the [[Stade Frederic Kibassa Maliba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstadiums.com/africa/countries/dr_congo.shtml Stadiums in the Democratic Republic Congo]. World Stadiums. Retrieved 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, the country is especially famous for its [[NBA]] players. [[Dikembe Mutombo]] is one of the best African basketball players to ever play the game. Mutombo is well known for humanitarian projects in his home country. [[Serge Ibaka]], [[Bismack Biyombo]], [[Christian Eyenga]] and [[Emmanuel Mudiay]] are others who gained significant international attention.

Since 1968 the Democratic Republic of the Congo has participated in the [[DR Congo at the Olympics|Olympic Games]].

===Food===
{{Main|Congolese cuisine}}

===Media===
Newspapers of the DRC include ''[[L'Avenir (newspaper)|L'Avenir]]'', ''La Cité africaine de Matadi'', ''La Conscience'', ''L'Observateur'', ''Le Phare'', ''[[Le Potentiel]]'', ''Le Soft'' and ''LeCongolais.CD'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International|first1=Courrier|title=Le Congolais|url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/notule-source/le-congolais|website=http://www.courrierinternational.com/|publisher=Courrier International}}&lt;/ref&gt; a web-based daily.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/africa/congok/congoknews.html Countries: Democatric Republic of the Congo: News]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6PAgrjRnm Archive]).{{sic}} [[Stanford University]] Libraries &amp; Academic Information Resources. Retrieved 28 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Télévision Nationale Congolaise (RTNC) is the national broadcaster of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. RTNC currently broadcasts in [[Lingala language|Lingala]], French, and English.

==Environmental issues==
A dense tropical rainforest in the DRC's central river basin and eastern highlands is bordered on the west within the Albertine Rift (the western branch of Africa's Great Rift System) and includes several of Africa's Great Lakes.

'''Major environmental issues'''

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's major environmental issues include:

* deforestation
* poaching, which threatens wildlife populations
* water pollution
* displaced refugees, who cause or are otherwise responsible for most of these problems: significant deforestation, soil erosion, wildlife poaching
* mining of minerals (coltan - a mineral used in creating capacitors, diamonds, and gold), causing environmental damage

==Renewable energy==
Because of sunlight, potential for solar development is very high in the DRC.  Already there are in DRC about 836 solar power systems, with a total power of 83&amp;nbsp;kW, located in Equateur (167), Katanga (159), Nord-Kivu (170), the two Kasaï provinces (170), and Bas-Congo (170).  Also, the 148 Caritas network system has a total power of 6.31 kW7.

The '''Republic of the Congo''' ({{lang-fr|République du Congo}}), also known as '''Congo''', '''Congo Republic''',&lt;ref&gt;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/congo/ New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; '''West Congo''', or '''Congo-Brazzaville''', is a [[Sovereign state|country]] located in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by five countries: [[Gabon]] to the west; [[Cameroon]] to the northwest; the [[Central African Republic]] to the northeast; the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the east and south; and the [[Angola]]n [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] to the southwest.

The region was dominated by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]-speaking tribes, who built trade links leading into the [[Congo River]] basin. Congo-Brazzaville was formerly part of the [[France|French]] colony of [[French Equatorial Africa|Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cf.html |title=Congo, Republic of the |publisher=CIA – The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon independence in 1960, the former colony of [[French Congo]] became the Republic of the Congo. The [[People's Republic of the Congo]] was a Marxist–Leninist [[one-party state]] from 1970 to 1991. Multi-party elections have been held since 1992, although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 [[Republic of the Congo Civil War]] and President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] has ruled for 26 of the past 36 years.

==History==
{{main|History of the Republic of the Congo}}

===Pre-colonial===
[[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking peoples]] who founded tribes during the [[Bantu expansion]]s largely displaced and absorbed the earliest inhabitants of the region, the [[Pygmy]] people, about 1500 BC. The [[Bakongo]], a Bantu ethnicity that also occupied parts of present-day Angola, Gabon and Democratic Republic of the Congo, formed the basis for ethnic affinities and rivalries among those countries. Several Bantu kingdoms—notably those of the  [[Kongo Empire|Kongo]], the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]], and the [[Kingdom of Anziku|Teke]]—built trade links leading into the Congo River basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;dos2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2825.htm|title=Background Note: Republic of the Congo|publisher=Department of State|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Court of Loango.png|thumb|left|The court of [[N'Gangue M'voumbe Niambi]], from the book ''Description of Africa'' (1668)]]

The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Diogo Cão]] reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484.&lt;ref name=&quot;DicImp&quot;/&gt; Commercial relationships quickly grew up between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded various commodities, manufactured goods, and people captured from the hinterlands. For centuries the Congo river delta served as a major commercial hub for transatlantic trade. However, direct European colonization of the area began in the late 19th century and eroded the power of the Bantu societies in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, C. R. ''The Portuguese Seaborne Empire, 1415–1825'', A. A. Knopf, 1969, ISBN 0090979400&lt;/ref&gt;

===French colonial era===
The area north of the Congo River came under French sovereignty in 1880 as a result of [[Pierre de Brazza]]'s treaty with [[Makoko (chief)|Makoko]] of the [[Bateke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DicImp&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This Congo Colony became known first as '''[[French Congo]]''', then as '''[[Middle Congo]]''' in 1903. In 1908, France organized [[French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), comprising Middle Congo, [[French Gabon|Gabon]], [[French Chad|Chad]], and [[Oubangui-Chari]] (the modern [[Central African Republic]]). The French designated [[Brazzaville]] as the federal capital. Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural-resource extraction. The methods were often brutal: establishment of the [[Congo–Ocean Railroad]] following [[World War I]] has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;DicImp&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Nazi occupation of France]] during [[World War II]], Brazzaville functioned as the symbolic capital of [[Free France]] between 1940 and 1943.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]] heralded a period of major reform in French colonial policy. Congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville.&lt;ref name=&quot;dos2009&quot;/&gt; It also received a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]].

Following the revision of the French constitution that established the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958, the AEF dissolved into its constituent parts, each of which became an autonomous colony within the [[French Community]]. During these reforms, Middle Congo became known as the Republic of the Congo in 1958&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Antagonism between the pro-[[Jacques Opangault|Opangault]] [[Mbochi]]s and the pro-[[Fulbert Youlou|Youlou]] Balalis resulted in a series of riots in Brazzaville in February 1959, which the [[French Army]] subdued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/1959/02/27/BGY503110492/?s=evacuations CONGO REPUBLIC: BRAZZAVILLE RIOTS AFTERMATH]. Reuters (February 27, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence era===
[[File:Alphonse Massamba-Debat.png|thumb|left|[[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]]'s one-party rule (1963–1968) attempted to implement a [[political economy|political economic]] strategy of &quot;[[scientific socialism]].&quot;]]
The Republic of the Congo received full independence from France on August 15, 1960. [[Fulbert Youlou]] ruled as the country's first president until labour elements and rival political parties instigated a [[Trois Glorieuses (1963)|three-day uprising]] that ousted him. The Congolese military took charge of the country briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]].

Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-Débat was elected President for a five-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;dos2009&quot;/&gt; During [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat#Congo under Massamba-Débat (1963-1968)|Massamba-Débat's term in office]] the regime adopted &quot;[[scientific socialism]]&quot; as the country's constitutional ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;shillington301&quot;/&gt; In 1965, Congo established relations with the [[Soviet Union]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shillington301&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African history|author=Shillington, Kevin |page=301|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=1579582451}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Massamba-Débat's regime also invited several hundred [[Cuba]]n army troops into the country to train his party's militia units and these troops helped his government survive a [[1966 Republic of the Congo coup d'état attempt|coup in 1966]] led by paratroopers loyal to future President [[Marien Ngouabi]]. Nevertheless, Massamba-Débat was unable to reconcile various institutional, tribal and ideological factions within the country&lt;ref name=&quot;shillington301&quot;/&gt; and his regime ended abruptly with a bloodless [[1968 Republic of the Congo coup d'état|coup d'état in September 1968]]. 
[[File:Marien Ngouabi.jpg|thumb|[[Marien Ngouabi]] changed the country's name to the [[People's Republic of the Congo]], declaring it to be [[Africa]]'s first Marxist–Leninist state and was assassinated in 1977.]]
[[Marien Ngouabi]], who had participated in the coup, assumed the presidency on December 31, 1968. One year later, President Ngouabi proclaimed Congo Africa's first &quot;people's republic&quot;, the [[People's Republic of the Congo]], and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the [[Congolese Party of Labour|Congolese Labour Party]] (PCT). Ngouabi survived an [[1972 Republic of the Congo coup d'état attempt|attempted coup in 1972]] but was assassinated on March 16, 1977. An 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was then named to head an interim government with [[Joachim Yhombi-Opango]] to serve as President of the Republic. Two years later, Yhombi-Opango was forced from power and [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] become the new president.&lt;ref name=&quot;dos2009&quot;/&gt;

Sassou Nguesso aligned the country with the [[Eastern Bloc]] and signed a twenty-year friendship pact with the Soviet Union. Over the years, Sassou had to rely more on [[political repression]] and less on [[patronage]] to maintain his dictatorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;shillington302&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African history|author=Shillington, Kevin |page=302|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=1579582451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pascal Lissouba]], who became Congo's first elected president (1992–1997) during the period of multi-party democracy, attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalise the economy. In June 1996 the IMF approved a three-year [[Special drawing rights|SDR]]69.5m (US$100m) enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in Congo in mid-1997.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Country Report Congo-Brazzaville|year=2003|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit|page=24|url=http://store.eiu.com/Product.aspx?pid=50000205&amp;gid=1310000331&amp;sid=735820073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congo's democratic progress was derailed in 1997 when Lissouba and Sassou started to fight for power in the [[Republic of the Congo Civil War|civil war]]. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. On June 5, President Lissouba's government forces surrounded Sassou's compound in Brazzaville and Sassou ordered members of his private militia (known as &quot;Cobras&quot;) to resist. Thus began a four-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville and caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths. In early October, the Angolan socialist régime began an invasion of Congo to install Sassou in power. In mid-October, the Lissouba government fell. Soon thereafter, Sassou declared himself president.&lt;ref name=&quot;dos2009&quot;/&gt;

In the controversial [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 2002|elections in 2002]], Sassou won with almost 90% of the vote cast. His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival, [[Andre Milongo]], advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;freedomhouse&quot;&gt;

International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum, both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo's era of the one-party state.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Sassou also won the following [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 2009|presidential election in July 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
[[File:Denis Sassou-Nguesso.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] served as President from 1979 to 1992 and has remained in power ever since his rebel forces ousted President [[Pascal Lissouba]] during the [[Republic of the Congo Civil War|1997 Civil War]].]]
{{main|Politics of the Republic of the Congo}}&lt;!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series--&gt;
{{see also|Foreign relations of the Republic of the Congo|Military of the Republic of the Congo}}
Congo-Brazzaville has had a multi-party political system since the early 1990s, although the system is heavily dominated by President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]]; he has lacked serious competition in the presidential elections held under his rule. Sassou Nguesso is backed by his own [[Congolese Labour Party]] ({{lang-fr|Parti Congolais du Travail}}) as well as a range of smaller parties.

Internationally, Sassou's regime has been hit by corruption revelations despite attempts to censor them. One French investigation found over 110 bank accounts and dozens of lavish properties in France; Sassou denounced embezzlement investigations as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;colonial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6948281.stm|title=Congo leader son fails in gag bid|publisher=BBC|date=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6209|title=Propping Up Africa's Dictators|publisher=Foreign Policy In Focus|date=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033107/http://af.reuters.com/article/idAFLR9382820090429?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=FACTBOX-African leaders' French assets under scrutiny|publisher=Reuters|date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2015 Sassou Nguesso announced that his government would hold a referendum to change the country's 2002 constitution and allow him to run for a third consecutive term in office.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Aaron (March 27, 2015) [http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-congo-president-idUSKBN0MN25N20150327 Congo Republic president says expects referendum over third term]. ''Reuters'' &lt;/ref&gt; On October 25 the government held a referendum to allow Sassou Nguesso to run in the next election. The government claimed that the proposal as approved by 92 percent of voters with 72 percent of eligible voters participating. The opposition, who had boycotted the referendum claimed that the government's statistics were false and that the vote was a sham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/30/us-congo-opposition-idUSKCN0SO24720151030#6gUx7xJL8tLmw1OB.97|title=Congo opposition holds ceremony for killed protesters=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===

In 2008, the main media were owned by the government, but many more privately run forms of media were being created. There is one government-owned television station and around 10 small private television channels.

It is also bounded by [[Gabon]] to the west, [[Cameroon]] and the [[Central African Republic]] to the north, and [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] ([[Angola]]) to the southwest. It has a short coast on the Atlantic Ocean.

The capital, [[Brazzaville]], is located on the Congo River, in the south of the country, immediately across from [[Kinshasa]], the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The southwest of the country is a coastal plain for which the primary drainage is the [[Kouilou-Niari River]]; the interior of the country consists of a central plateau between two basins to the south and north. Forests are under increasing exploitation pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.wri.org/gfw_congo_atlas_v1_affiche_fr.pdf Map: Situation de l'exploitation forestière en République du Congo]. (PDF) . Retrieved on February 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the country is located on the Equator, the climate is consistent year-round, with the average day temperature being a humid {{convert|24|C|F}} and nights generally between {{convert|16|C|F}} and {{convert|21|C|F}}. The average yearly rainfall ranges from {{convert|1100|mm|in}} in south in the [[Niari Valley]] to over {{convert|2000|mm|in}} in central parts of the country. The dry season is from June to August while in the majority of the country the wet season has two rainfall maxima: one in March–May and another in September–November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2006–07, researchers from the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] studied gorillas in heavily forested regions centered on the Ouesso district of the [[Sangha Region]]. They suggest a population on the order of 125,000 [[Western Lowland Gorilla]]s, whose isolation from humans has been largely preserved by inhospitable swamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93254830 |title='Mother Lode' Of Gorillas Found In Congo Forests : NPR |accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manihot esculenta - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-090.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cassava]] is an important food crop in the Republic of Congo.]]

The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on [[petroleum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323115110/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/congo2.html|title=Congo-Brazzaville|publisher=Energy Information Administration, U.S. Government|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; support services, and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Petroleum extraction has supplanted [[forestry]] as the mainstay of the economy. In 2008, oil sector accounted for 65% of the GDP, 85% of government revenue, and 92% of exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/CONGOEXTN/0,,menuPK:349223~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:349199,00.html Republic of Congo] World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; The country also has large untapped [[Mining in the Republic of Congo|mineral]] wealth.

In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its petroleum earnings, contributing to a shortage of revenues. January 12, 1994 devaluation of [[CFA franc|Franc Zone]] currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 46% in 1994, but inflation has subsided since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations, notably the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. When Sassou Nguesso returned to power at the end of the war in October 1997, he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit.

The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic problems of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty, despite record-high oil prices since 2003. Natural gas and diamonds are also recent major Congolese exports, although Congo was excluded from the [[Kimberley Process]] in 2004 amid allegations that most of its diamond exports were in fact being smuggled out of the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]; it was re-admitted to the group in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transportation==

Transport in the Republic of the Congo includes land, air and water transportation. The country's [[Congo–Ocean Railway|rail system]] was built by forced laborers during the 1930s and largely remains in operation. There are also over 1000&amp;nbsp;km of paved roads and two major international airports ([[Maya-Maya Airport]] and [[Pointe Noire Airport]]) which have flights to Paris and many African cities. The country also has a large port on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Pointe-Noire]] and others along the [[Congo River]] at [[Brazzaville]] and [[Impfondo]].

The Republic of the Congo's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country, leaving the vast areas of tropical [[jungle]] in the north virtually uninhabited. Thus, Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa, with 70% of its total population living in a few urban areas, namely in [[Brazzaville]], [[Pointe-Noire]] or one of the small cities or villages lining the {{convert|534|km|sing=on}} railway which connects the two cities. In rural areas, industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years, leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDept&quot;/&gt;

Ethnically and linguistically the population of the Republic of the Congo is diverse—[[Ethnologue]] recognises 62 spoken languages in the country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CG |title=Languages of Congo |publisher=SIL International |accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but can be grouped into three categories. The [[Kongo people|Kongo]] are the largest ethnic group and form roughly half of the population. The most significant subgroups of the Kongo are [[Lari (ethnic group)|Laari]] in Brazzaville and Pool regions and Vili around Pointe-Noire and along the Atlantic coast. The second largest group are the [[Bateke|Teke]] who live to the north of Brazzaville with 17% of the population. [[Mbochi|Boulangui]] (M’Boshi) live in the northwest and in Brazzaville and form 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnic groups worldwide |author=Levinson, David |year=1998 |pages=120–121 |isbn=978-1-57356-019-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=4141 |title=Congo Overview |publisher=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pygmies]] make up 2% of Congo's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/08/05/les-pygmees-du-congo-en-danger-d-extinction_1556735_3212.html#ens_id=1259967 Les pygmées du Congo en &quot;danger d'extinction].

Before the 1997 war, about 9,000 [[Europe]]ans and other non-Africans lived in Congo, most of whom were [[France|French]]; only a fraction of this number remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDept&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2825.htm#people Background Note: Republic of the Congo] [[United States Department of State]].

The people of Republic of the Congo are largely a mix of [[Catholics]] (33.1%), [[Awakening (religious movement)|Awakening Lutherans]] (22.3%) and [[Protestants]] (19.9%). Followers of [[Islam]] make up 1.6%, and this is primarily due to an influx of foreign workers into the urban centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

According to a 2011–12 survey, total fertility rate was 5.1 children born per woman, with 4.5 in urban areas and 6.5 in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR267/FR267.pdf Congo.

Education between ages six and sixteen is compulsory. Pupils who complete six years of primary school and seven years of secondary school obtain a baccalaureate. At the university, students can obtain a bachelor's degree in three years and a master's after four. Marien Ngouabi University—which offers courses in medicine, law and several other fields—is the country's only public university. Instruction at all levels is in [[French language|French]], and the educational system as a whole models the French system. The educational infrastructure has been seriously degraded as a result of political and economic crises. There are no seats in most classrooms, forcing children to sit on the floor. Enterprising individuals have set up private schools, but they often lack the technical knowledge and familiarity with the national curriculum to teach effectively. Families frequently enroll their children in private schools only to find they cannot make the payments.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{See also|Macedonia naming dispute}}
The country's name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Μακεδονία (''Makedonía''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599 Μακεδονία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonia&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Macedonia Macedonia], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]].

===Medieval and Ottoman period===
{{Main|South Slavs}}
{{Further|Bulgaria (theme)|Ottoman Vardar Macedonia}}

[[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] settled in the Balkan region including Macedonia by the late 6th century. During the 580s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] literature attests to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] raiding Byzantine territories in the region of Macedonia, later aided by [[Bulgars]]. Historical records document that in c. 680 a group of Bulgars, Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called [[Kuber]] settled in the region of the Keramisian plain, centred on the city of [[Bitola]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acta Sancti Demetrii&quot;, V 195–207, Гръцки извори за българската история, 3, стр. 159–166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian's]] reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. The Slavic peoples that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].

In 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated the armies of [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria]], and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (including Macedonia) for the first time since the 7th century. However, by the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.

In the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]], who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine [[despotism]]. [[Skopje]] became the capital of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dusan]]'s empire.

Following Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] into Europe. The [[Kingdom of Prilep]] was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the [[Serbian Empire]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC&amp;pg=PA275|title=The last Centuries of Byzantium, (1261–1453)|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-43991-6|page=500|author1=Nicol, Donald Macgillivray}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remained under its domination for five centuries.

Several movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO). In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after [[World War I]] the organisation separated into the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) and the [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (ITRO).

In the early years of the organisation membership was open only to Bulgarians, but later it was opened to all inhabitants of European Turkey, ''regardless of their nationality or religion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA136 ''Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe'', Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, ISBN 3825813878, p. 136.]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of its members, however, were [[Macedonian Bulgarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA209|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey: Volume 2, Reform, Revolution, and Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey 1808–1975|author=Stanford J.

The uprising and the forming of the Krushevo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the Macedonian state.

Following the two [[Balkan Wars|Balkan wars]] of 1912 and 1913 and the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], most of its European-held territories were divided between [[Greece]], Bulgaria and [[Serbia]]. The territory of the modern Macedonian state was annexed by Serbia and named ''{{lang|sr|Južna Srbija}}'', &quot;[[Macedonia (terminology)|Southern Serbia]]&quot;. Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control.&lt;ref name=Banac&gt;{{cite book |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia.

In the fall of 1915 Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] in the [[First World War]] and gained control over most of the territory of the present day Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Banac/&gt; After the end of the First World War the area returned to Serbian control as part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and saw a reintroduction of the anti-Bulgarian measures of the first occupation (1913 - 1915):  Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved.&lt;ref name=Banac/&gt;

The Serbian government pursued a policy of [[Serbianisation|Serbisation]] in the region, which included systematic repression of Bulgarian activists, altering family surnames, internal colonisation, forced labor, and intense propaganda. To aid the implementation of this policy, some 50,000 Serbian army and gendermerie were stationed in Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Banac/&gt; By 1940 about 280 Serbian colonies (comprising 4,200 families) were established as part of the government's internal colonisation program (initial plans envisaged 50,000 families settling in Macedonia).&lt;ref name=Banac/&gt;

In 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and divided into provinces called [[banovina (region)|banovinas]]. Southern Serbia, including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia, became known as the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The concept of a [[United Macedonia]] was used by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) in the [[interbellum]]. Its leaders&amp;nbsp;– including [[Todor Alexandrov]], [[Aleksandar Protogerov]], and [[Ivan Mihailov]]&amp;nbsp;– promoted independence of the Macedonian territory split between Serbia and Greece for the whole population, regardless of religion and ethnicity {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Banovina, together with [[Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]], which also conducted guerilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there. In 1923 in Stip a paramilitary organisation called [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]] was formed by Serbian chetniks, IMRO renegades and [[Macedonian Federative Organization]] (MFO) members to oppose IMRO and MMTRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vassil Karloukovski |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/ag/ag_4_6.html |title=Гиза, Антони, &quot;Балканските държави и Македония&quot;, Македонски Научен Институт  София, 2001 г |publisher=Promacedonia.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macedonist ideas increased during the [[interbellum]], in Yugoslav [[Vardar Macedonia]], and among the left diaspora in Bulgaria, and were supported by the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ilGfCIF4Ao4C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=macedonism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wTPbTu-4HcXQsga37qTuCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=macedonism&amp;f=false Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev,  Scarecrow Press, 2009, ISBN 0-8108-5565-8, pp. 139–140.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 it issued a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the Macedonian Question|special resolution]] in which for the first time directions were provided for recognizing the existence of a separate [[Macedonian nation]] and [[Macedonian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Perry, &quot;The Republic of Macedonia: finding its way&quot; in Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parrot (eds.), Politics, power and the struggle for Democracy in South-Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liberation of Skopje.jpg|thumb|left|160|[[Metodija Andonov Chento]] greeted in Skopje after the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia]] in 1944.]]

During World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] from 1941 to 1945. The [[Vardar Banovina]] was divided between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Italy|Italian]]-occupied [[Albania]]. [[Bulgarian Action Committees]] were established to prepare the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bugarash/bccc_1941/index.html Bulgarian Campaign Committees in Macedonia&amp;nbsp;– 1941] Dimitre Mičev&lt;/ref&gt; The Committees were mostly formed by former members of IMRO, but some communists such as [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Strahil Gigov]] and [[Metodi Shatorov]] also participated.

As leader of the Vardar Macedonia communists, Shatorov switched from the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]] to the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WC5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Shatorov+bulgarian&amp;dq=Shatorov+bulgarian&amp;lr=&amp;hl=bg&amp;pgis=1 Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Valentina Georgieva, Sasha Konechni, Scarecrow Press, 1998, ISBN 0-8108-3336-0, p. 223].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j_NbmSoRsRcC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=Metodi+Shatorov+bulgarian+communist |title=Who are the Macedonians?|author=Hugh Poulton|publisher=C.

The Bulgarian authorities, under German pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]], but under German pressure those Jews from their newly annexed territories without Bulgarian citizenship were deported, such as those from Vardar Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]].

He began in earnest to organise armed resistance to the Bulgarian rule and sharply criticised Sharlo's pro-Bulgarian policy. At a meeting of the partisan brigades, as well as a group of battalions in the Resen region on 21 December 1943, Tempo makes the following comments about Shatorov and the leadership of the MCP: &quot;They thought that the Macedonian people were Bulgarians and that they were oppressed by the hegemony of Great Serbia and had to be transferred to Bulgaria. Their basic slogan is: 'All non-Macedonians out of Macedonia'. The capital J [Serbo-Croatian spelling of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavian, etc.] was deleted from all documents. In fact they did not want Yugoslavia, no matter where it stood politically. When the war started, the initial decision of this leadership was to be separate from Yugoslavia and from Tito. They declared that Macedonia would be free as soon as the Bulgarians came....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation War]] ensued, with German forces being driven out of Macedonia by the end of 1944.

In Vardar Macedonia, after the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]] the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, four armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilised and reorganised. Most of them re-entered occupied Yugoslavia in early October 1944 and moved from Sofia to [[Niš]], Skopje and [[Pristina]] with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A8X6UH58dlgC&amp;pg=PA33 Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941–45, Nigel Thomas, K. Mikulan, Darko Pavlović, Osprey Publishing, 1995, ISBN 1-85532-473-3, p. 33.]&lt;/ref&gt; Compelled by the Soviet Union with a view towards the creation of a large South Slav Federation, the Bulgarian government once again offered to give Pirin Macedonia to such a United Macedonia in 1945.

}}
In 1944 the [[ASNOM|Anti-Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM)]] proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the ''People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''. ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of [[Krste Misirkov|Krste Petkov Misirkov]].

The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1963, the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed, becoming the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. During the [[Greek Civil War|civil war in Greece]] (1946–1949) Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there. The state dropped the &quot;Socialist&quot; from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.

===Declaration of independence===&lt;!--linked from [[Template:Yugoslavia topics]]--&gt;
The country officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as [[Independence Day (Republic of Macedonia)|Independence day]] ({{lang-mk|Ден на независноста}}, ''Den na nezavisnosta''), with regard to [[Macedonian independence referendum, 1991|the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia]], albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising ([[Elijah|St. Elijah]]'s Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the [[Republic Day (Republic of Macedonia)|Day of the Republic]].

[[Robert Badinter]] as the head of the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia]] recommended EC recognition in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20050215223455/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |title=Recognition of States: Annex 3 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albanian Protesters 2.jpg|thumb|[[2012 Republic of Macedonia inter-ethnic violence|Republic of Macedonia inter-ethnic violence]] in 2012]]
Macedonia remained at peace through the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. However, it was seriously destabilised by the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. Although they departed shortly after the war, soon after, [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|Albanian nationalists]] on both sides of the border took up arms in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of Macedonia.

===Albanian insurgency===
{{Main|Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia}}
A [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|conflict]] took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001. The war ended with the intervention of a [[NATO]] ceasefire monitoring force. Under the terms of the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority. The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all Macedonian institutions fully. In addition, according to this accord, the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|NLA]] were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvfan.net/ria-novosti-clashes-between-macedonians-and-albanians-in-macedonia/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galicica-viewfromKorita.JPG|thumb|[[Galičica]], view from [[Korita, Republic of Macedonia|Korita]]]]

Macedonia has a total area of {{convert|25713|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It lies between latitudes [[40th parallel north|40°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]] (a small area lies east of 23°). Macedonia has some {{convert|748|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of boundaries, shared with [[Serbia]] ({{convert|62|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the North, Kosovo ({{convert|159|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the northwest, [[Bulgaria]] ({{convert|148|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the east, [[Greece]] ({{convert|228|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the south, and [[Albania]] ({{convert|151|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the west. It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the east. It is part of a larger region also known as [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which also includes a [[Macedonia (Greece)|region of northern Greece]] of the same name and the [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad province]] in southwestern [[geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].

===Topography===
{{Main|Mountains of the Republic of Macedonia}}

Macedonia is a [[landlocked country]] that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The terrain is mostly rugged, located between the [[Šar Mountains]] and [[Osogovo]], which frame the valley of the [[Vardar]] river. Three large lakes&amp;nbsp;— [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Dojran Lake]]&amp;nbsp;— lie on the southern borders, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |title=Macedonian Ministry of Environment |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080119010740/http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |archivedate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000.

Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different [[mountain range]]s: the first is the Šar Mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523838/Sar-Mountains |title=Britannica's article about Sar Mountains |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euratlas.com/Atlasphys/Sarplanina2.htm |title=Sar Mountains on the Euratlas map of the Europe's most significant mountain ranges |publisher=Euratlas.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continues to the West Vardar/Pelagonia group of mountains ([[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]], [[Nidže]], [[Kožuf|Kozuf]] and [[Jakupica]]), also known as the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric range]]. The second range is the [[Osogovo]]–[[Belasica]] mountain chain, also known as the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope range]]. The mountains belonging to the Šar Mountains and the West Vardar/Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains of the Osogovo-Belasica mountain group. [[Mount Korab]] of the Šar Mountains on the Albanian border, at 2,764 m (9,068&amp;nbsp;ft), is the tallest mountain in Macedonia.

===Hydrography===
[[File:SmolareWaterfall.JPG|thumb|right|[[Smolare Waterfall]]]]
In the Republic of Macedonia there are 1,100 large sources of water. The rivers flow into three different basins: the Aegean, the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/links/geography.htm |title=Macedonia |publisher=Mymacedonia.net |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean basin is the largest. It covers 87% of the territory of the Republic, which is {{convert|22075|km2|0|abbr=out}}. [[Vardar]], the largest river in this basin, drains 80% of the territory or {{convert|20459|km2|0|abbr=out}}. Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country. The project named 'The Vardar Valley' is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country.

The river [[Black Drin]] forms the Adriatic basin, which covers an area of about {{convert|3320|km2|0|abbr=on}}, i.e., 13% of the territory. It receives water from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid.

The Black Sea basin is the smallest with only {{convert|37|km2|0|abbr=on}}. It covers the northern side of Mount [[Skopska Crna Gora]]. This is the source of the river Binachka Morava, which joins the [[Great Morava|Morava]], and later, the [[Danube]], which flows into the Black Sea.

Macedonia has around fifty ponds and three natural lakes, [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Lake Dojran]].

In Macedonia there are nine spa towns and resorts: Banište, Banja Bansko, Istibanja, Katlanovo, [[Kežovica]], Kosovrasti, Banja Kočani, Kumanovski Banji and Negorci.

===Climate===
{{See also|Geography of Republic of Macedonia#Climate|l1=Climate of the Republic of Macedonia}}

Macedonia has a transitional climate from Mediterranean to continental. The summers are hot and dry, and the winters are moderately cold. Average annual precipitation varies from {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the western mountainous area to {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the eastern area. There are three main climatic zones in the country: temperate Mediterranean, mountainous, and mildly continental. Along the valleys of the [[Vardar]] and [[Strumica]] rivers, in the regions of [[Gevgelija]], [[Valandovo]], [[Dojran]], Strumica, and [[Radoviš]], the climate is temperate Mediterranean. The warmest regions are [[Demir Kapija]] and Gevgelija, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds {{convert|40|°C|°F}}. The mountainous climate is present in the mountainous regions of the country, and it is characterised by long and snowy winters and short and cold summers. The spring is colder than the fall. The majority of Macedonia has a moderate [[continental climate]] with warm and dry summers and relatively cold and wet winters. There are thirty main and regular weather stations in the country.

===National parks===
The country has three [[national park]]s:

[[File:Pinus peuce Habitus BotGardBln0906.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian Pine or Molika, one of Macedonia's most recognisable trees]]

The [[flora]] of Republic of Macedonia is represented by around 210 [[family (biology)|families]], 920 [[genus (biology)|genera]], and around 3,700 plant [[species]]. The most abundant group are the [[flowering plant]]s with around 3,200 species, which is followed by [[moss]]es (350 species) and [[fern]]s (42).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], [[Balkan]] mixed forests, [[Rhodopes]] mixed forests and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and mixed forests.

[[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|National Park of Pelister]] in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic [[Macedonian Pine]], as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a [[relict]] of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine [[Macedonian Pine|Molika]], was first noted on Pelister in 1893.

Macedonia's limited forest growth also includes [[Macedonian Oak]]s, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on Šar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia—the poppy. The quality of thick [[poppy]] juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese [[opium]] contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opiums in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=246 |title=Macedonian Flora |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Fauna of Macedonia}}

The fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears, wild boars, wolves, foxes, squirrels, chamois and deer. The lynx is found, although very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of Demir Kapija. Forest birds include the blackcap, the grouse, the black grouse, the imperial eagle and the forest owl.

The three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&amp;nbsp;million years; similar species can only be found in [[Lake Baikal]]. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the [[European eel]] and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant [[Sargasso Sea]], thousands of kilometres away, and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10&amp;nbsp;years. When sexually mature, the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to set off back to its point of birth. There it spawns and dies, leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew.

===Domestic animals===
The shepherd dog of Šar Mountain is known worldwide as [[Šarplaninac|Šarplaninec]] (Yugoslav shepherd). It stands some 60&amp;nbsp;centimeters tall and is a brave and fierce fighter that may be called upon to fight bears or wolf packs in guarding and defending flocks. The Šarplaninec originates from the shepherd's dog of the ancient Epirotes, the molossus, but the Šarplaninec was recognised as its own breed in 1939 under the name of &quot;Illyrian shepherd&quot; and since 1956 has been known as Šarplaninec.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Macedonia-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|Map of the Republic of Macedonia.]]
Macedonia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with an [[executive (government)|executive government]] composed of a coalition of parties from the [[unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] ({{lang|mk|Собрание, ''Sobranie''}}) and an independent [[judiciary|judicial branch]] with a [[constitutional court]]. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the President of the Government. The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state armed forces and a president of the [[National security|state Security]] Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most. On the second run of the [[Macedonian presidential election, 2009|presidential elections held on 5 April 2009]], [[Gjorge Ivanov]] was elected as new Macedonian president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ivanov-elected-new-macedonian-president |title=Ivanov Elected New Macedonian President |publisher=BalkanInsight |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities ({{lang|mk|општини, ''opštini''}}; [[Grammatical number|singular]]: {{lang|mk|општина, ''opština''}}). The capital, [[Skopje]], is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the &quot;City of Skopje&quot;. Municipalities in Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.

The country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, Macedonia's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.

After a troublesome pre-election campaign, Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|elections held on 5 July 2006]]. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party [[VMRO–DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] led by [[Nikola Gruevski]]. Gruevski's decision to include the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]] in the new government, instead of the [[Democratic Union for Integration]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population. However, a dialogue was later established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO-DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limun.hr/en/main.aspx?id=127474 |title=Ahmeti accepts the invitation for dialog with Gruevski |publisher=Limun.hr |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early parliamentary elections held in 2008, VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Union for Integration formed a ruling coalition in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/07/08/feature-02 |title=VMRO-DPMNE and DUI form ruling coalition in Macedonia |publisher=SeTimes |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, presidential and local elections in the country were carried out peacefully, which was crucial for Macedonian aspirations to join the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0322/breaking39.htm |title=Macedonia elections pass off peacefully |publisher=Irish Times |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling conservative VMRO-DPMNE party won a victory in the local elections and the candidate supported by the party, Gjorgi Ivanov, was elected as the new president.

===Parliament===
{{Main|Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia}}

Macedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia. It is referred to within the UN as &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;, pending a resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute|long-running dispute]] with [[Greece]] about the country's name.

The major interest of the country is a full integration in the European and the [[wikt:transatlantic|Trans-Atlantic]] integration processes. Five foreign policy priorities are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=308 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commencing negotiations for full-fledged membership in the European Union
* Lifting the [[visa (document)|visa]] regime for Macedonian nationals
* NATO membership
* Resolving the naming issue with Greece
* Strengthening the economic and [[public diplomacy]]

Macedonia is a member of the following international and regional organisations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=314 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (since 1992), [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (since 1993), [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]] (since 1993), [[Central European Initiative]] (since 1993), [[Council of Europe]] (since 1995), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] (since 1995), [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative|SECI]] (since 1996), [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] (since 2003), [[Central European Free Trade Agreement|CEFTA]] (since 2006), [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]] (since 2001).

In 2005, the country was officially recognised as a [[European Union]] candidate state.

On the NATO summit held in [[Bucharest]] in April 2008, Macedonia failed to gain an invitation to join the organisation because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M3 Web&amp;nbsp;– http://m3web.bg |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91875 |title=Bulgaria: Macedonia Remains Out of NATO Because of Greek Veto over Name Dispute&amp;nbsp;– Novinite.com&amp;nbsp;– Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USA had previously expressed support for an invitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/2/worldupdates/2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |title=Greece stands by NATO veto threat for Macedonia |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the summit then decided to extend an invitation only on condition of a resolution of the naming conflict with Greece.

In March 2009 the [[European Parliament]] expressed support for Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ep-urges-accession-talks-for-macedonia |title=EP Urges Accession Talks For Macedonia |publisher=BalkanInsight.com |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for accession talks as a result of the naming dispute. The EU's stance is similar to NATO's in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of accession talks.

In October 2012 the EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Štefan Füle]] proposed a start of accession negotiations with Macedonia for the fourth time,  while the previous efforts were blocked each time by Greece. At the same time Füle visited Bulgaria in a bid to clarify the state's position with respect to Macedonia. He established that Bulgaria almost has joined Greece in vetoing the accession talks with Macedonia. Bulgarian position was that Sofia cannot grant an EU certificate to Skopje, which is systematically employing an ideology of hate towards Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/bulgaria-vetoes-macedonia-eu-acc-news-515809 EurActiv, 2 November 2012, Bulgaria vetoes Macedonia’s EU accession.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Naming dispute====
{{Main|Macedonia naming dispute}}
{{See also|Macedonia (terminology)}}
After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the name of Macedonia became the object of a dispute between Greece and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910/ |title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM |accessdate=11 February 2008 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the south, the Republic of Macedonia borders the region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]], which administratively is split into three [[Peripheries of Greece|peripheries]] (one of them comprising both [[Western Thrace]] and a part of Greek Macedonia). Citing [[Macedonia naming dispute#Greek position|historical and territorial concerns]] resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|kingdom of Macedon]] which falls within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposes the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier, supporting a compound name (such as &quot;Northern Macedonia&quot;) for use by all and for all purposes (''[[erga omnes]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ FYROM Name Issue], Hellenic Republic&amp;nbsp;– Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonians]], unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects to the use of the term &quot;Macedonian&quot; for the neighboring country's largest [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic group]]. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of [[Culture of Greece|Greece's culture]] (such as [[Vergina Sun]], a symbol associated with the ancient kingdom of Macedon, and [[Alexander the Great]]), and of promoting the [[irredentist]] concept of a [[United Macedonia]], which would include territories of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Serbia]].

From 1992 to 1995, the two countries engaged in a dispute over the Macedonian state's new flag, which incorporated the [[Vergina Sun]] symbol. This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995.

The UN adopted the provisional reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; ({{lang-mk|Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија}}) when the country was admitted to the organisation in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r225.htm |title=United Nations Resolution 225 (1993) |publisher=United Nations |date=8 April 1993 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most international organisations, such as the [[European Union]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]], adopted the same convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=European Commission |title=Background information&amp;nbsp;— The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia |url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/international/bilateral/background/mk1_en.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071223150634/http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/international/bilateral/background/mk1_en.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=European Broadcasting Union |title=Members' Logos |url=http://www.ebu.ch/members/members_logos.php |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/pdf/key_documents/2005/package/sec_1425_final_analytical_report_mk_en.pdf |title=Analytical Report for the Opinion on the application from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for EU membership |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/maps/applicants/fyrom_en.htm |title=Europa&amp;nbsp;– The EU at a glance&amp;nbsp;– Maps&amp;nbsp;– FYROM |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=International Olympic Committee |title=List of national olympic committees participating in the xix olympic winter games in salt lake city |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_258.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] also uses the reference in official documents but adds an explanation on which member countries recognise the constitutional name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=North Atlantic Treaty Organisation |title=The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is critical |url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/0723/e0725a.htm |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same reference is also used in any discussion to which Greece is a party&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1737425.stm Bid to settle Macedonia name row], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most UN member countries have abandoned the provisional reference and have recognised the country as the ''Republic of Macedonia'' instead. These include four of the five permanent [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] members—the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US snubs Greece over Macedonia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3981499.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=4 November 2004 |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]], United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China; several members of the European Union such as [[Bulgaria]], Poland, and [[Slovenia]]; and over 100 other [[List of United Nations member states|UN members]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Opinion/comm_20050916Tziampiris.html Naming the solution]&quot;, ''[[Kathimerini]]'' English edition, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has set up a negotiating process with a mediator, [[Matthew Nimetz]], and the two parties to the dispute, Macedonia and Greece, to try to mediate the dispute. Negotiations continue between the two sides but have yet to reach any settlement of the dispute.

Initially the [[European Community]]-nominated Arbitration Commission's opinion was that &quot;the use of the name 'Macedonia' cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20050215223455/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |title=European Journal of International Law |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the commission's opinion, Greece continued to object to the establishment of relations between the Community and the Republic under its constitutional name.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite web |publisher=in: Kourvetaris et al.

A Name for a Conflict? FYROM's Dispute with Greece Revisited|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the coming to power in 2006, and especially since Macedonia's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government has pursued a policy of &quot;[[Macedonian nationalism#Post-independence period and Antiquisation|Antiquisation]]&quot; (&quot;Antikvizatzija&quot;) as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgievski&quot;&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, 27 October 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] have been built in several cities across the country. Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums have been renamed after Alexander and Philip. These actions are seen as deliberate provocations in neighboring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling Macedonia's EU and NATO applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Greece slates Skopje's provocative Alexander statue'' Sinisa Jakov Marusic, Balkan Insight, 15 June 2011 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-slates-skopje-s-provocative-alexander-statue]&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgievski&quot;/&gt;

In November 2008, Macedonia instituted proceedings before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against [[Greece]] alleging violations of the 1995 Interim Accord that blocked its accession to NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Davorin&amp;nbsp;– Ljubljana |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081117-macedonia-sues-greece-blocking-nato-entry-membership-name |title=Macedonia sues Greece for blocking NATO entry |publisher=France 24 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICJ was requested to order Greece to observe its obligations within the Accord, which is legally binding for both countries.  In 2011 The United Nations' International Court of Justice ruled that Greece violated Article 11 of the 1995 Interim Accord by vetoing Macedonia's bid for [[NATO]] membership at the 2008 summit in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia institutes proceedings against Greece for a violation of Article 11 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, however, did not consider it necessary to grant Macedonia's request that it instruct Greece to refrain from similar actions in the future since &quot;[a]s a general rule, there is no reason to suppose that a State whose act or conduct has been declared wrongful by the Court will repeat that act or conduct in the future, since its good faith must be presumed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/16827.pdf|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor has there been to date a change in the EU's stance that Macedonia's accession negotiations cannot begin until the name issue is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21541400 The Economist, 11 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia}}

The Republic of Macedonia is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the U.N. Geneva [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]], and the Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.

There do, however, continue to be problems with [[human rights]]. According to human rights organisations, in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions, threats against, and intimidation of, human rights activists and opposition journalists, and allegations of [[torture]] by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/macedonia?page=2 |title=Amnesty International&amp;nbsp;– Summary&amp;nbsp;– Macedonia |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/macedonia/ Human Rights Watch&amp;nbsp;– Campaigns&amp;nbsp;– Conflict in Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{Main|Military of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Mi-24 Macedonian.jpg|thumb|right|[[Macedonian Air Force]] [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] helicopter]]
The [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Armed Forces]] comprise the army, [[Macedonian Air Force|air force]] and [[Wolves (military)|Special Forces]]. The government's national defence policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, the integrity of its land area and airspace and its constitutional order. Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the Armed Forces in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and the European Union member states and their capability to participate in the full range of NATO missions.

The Ministry of Defence develops the Republic's defence strategy and assesses possible threats and risks. It is also responsible for the defence system, including training, readiness, equipment, and development, and for drawing up and presenting the defence budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morm.gov.mk/morm/en/ARM/Defence-Structure.html National Command Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Macedonia}}
Ranked as the fourth &quot;best reformatory state&quot; out of 178 countries ranked by the [[World Bank]] in 2009, Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/eca/eca.nsf/f27e125b8411fe0e852567d10013f34a/fffd3db0d7306bfd85256c250061ac88/$FILE/Macedonia%20Country%20Brief.pdf |title=Macedonia Country Brief |publisher=The World Bank |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has developed an [[open economy]] with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years. Since 1996, Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, [[economic growth]] with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005. This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-devdata&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf |title=World Bank development data |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an [[inflation rate]] of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank&quot;/&gt; and has implemented policies focused on attracting [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The current government introduced a [[flat tax]] system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment. The flat tax rate was 12% in 2007 and was further lowered to 10% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080127122623/http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archivedate=27 January 2008 |title=Government of the Republic of Macedonia |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/macedonias-new-flat-tax-51002.aspx |title=Macedonia's Flat Tax |publisher=Nuwireinvestor.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, as of 2005 Macedonia's [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] was 37.2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org.mk/ |title=Macedonian unemployment rate |publisher=Worldbank.org.mk |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2006 its [[poverty threshold|poverty rate]] was 22%.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-devdata&quot;/&gt; However, due to a number of employment measures as well as the successful process of attracting multinational corporations, and according to the Macedonian State Statistical Office, country's unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2015 decreased to 27.3%.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?rbrtxt=98 Active population - Unemployment data]&lt;/ref&gt; Government's policies and efforts in regards to foreign direct investments have resulted with the establishment of local subsidiaries of several world leading manufacturing companies, especially from the automotive industry, such as: [[Johnson Controls|Johnson Controls Inc.]], [[Van Hool|Van Hool NV]], [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson Matthey plc]], [[Lear Corporation|Lear Corp.]], [[Visteon|Visteon Corp.]], [[Kostal-Gruppe|Kostal GmbH]], [[Gentherm Incorporated|Gentherm Inc.]], [[Dräxlmaier Group]], [[Kromberg &amp; Schubert]], [[Marquardt Group|Marquardt GmbH]], [[Amphenol|Amphenol Corp.]], [[Tekno Hose SpA]], [[KEMET Corporation|KEMET Corp.]], [[Key Safety Systems Inc.]], [[ODW-Elektrik GmbH]], etc.

Macedonia has one of the highest shares of people struggling financially, with 72% of its citizens stating that they could only manage on their household’s income &quot;with difficulty&quot; or &quot;with great difficulty&quot;, though Macedonia, along with Croatia, was the only country in the Western Balkans to not report an increase in this statistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkan-monitor.eu/files/BalkanMonitor-2010_Summary_of_Findings.pdf Gallup Balkan Monitor], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful [[economic development]]. Macedonia still has one of the lowest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita GDPs]] in Europe. Furthermore, the country's [[grey market]] is estimated at close to 20% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;The 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA Factbook]] [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html CIA Factbook Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of GDP structure, as of 2013 the manufacturing sector, including mining and construction constituted the largest part of GDP at 21.4%, up from 21.1% in 2012. The trade, transportation and accommodation sector represents 18.2% of GDP in 2013, up from 16.7% in 2012, while agriculture represents 9.6%, up from 9.1% in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?id=32&amp;rbr=1495 Gross domestic product 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of foreign trade, the largest sector contributing to the country's export in 2014 was &quot;chemicals and related products&quot; at 21.4%, followed by the &quot;machinery and transport equipment&quot; sector at 21.1%. Macedonia's main import sectors in 2014 were &quot;manufactured goods classified chiefly by material&quot; with 34.2%, &quot;machinery and transport equipment&quot; with 18.7% and &quot;mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials&quot; with 14.4% of the total imports. Even 68.8% of the foreign trade in 2014 was done with the EU which makes the Union by far the largest trading partner of Macedonia (23.3% with Germany, 7.9% with the UK, 7.3% with Greece, 6.2% with Italy, etc.). Almost 12% of the total external trade in 2014 was done with the Western Balkan countries.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?id=78&amp;rbr=1590 External trade volume 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a GDP per capita of US$9,157 at [[purchasing power parity]] and a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] of 0.701, Macedonia is less developed and has a considerably smaller economy than most of the former Yugoslav states.

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Macedonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 36% of the EU average in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure and e-infrastructure===
Macedonia (along with [[Montenegro]], Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Kosovo]]) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia. It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav [[internal market]] collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist [[Eastern Europe|East European]] countries during the transition to a [[market economy]]. Its main land and rail exports route, through [[Serbia]], remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany. Macedonia's IT market increased 63.8% year on year in 2007, which is the fastest growing in the Adriatic region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idc-cema.com/?showproduct=34598 &quot;Investment in Government, Finance, and Telecom Sectors Makes Macedonia's IT Market the Fastest Growing in the Adriatic Region, Says IDC&quot;], ''IDC'' (global provider of market intelligence)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade and investment===
The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on [[Serbia and Montenegro]] caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia. When Greece imposed a [[embargo|trade embargo]] on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected. Some relief was afforded by the end of the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian war]] in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation.

Since the end of the Greek embargo, Greece has become the country's most important business partner. (See [[Greek investments in the Republic of Macedonia]].) Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=19&amp;article=24108 |title=Greek investments in FYROM at 1 bil.

However, local cross-border trade between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia sees thousands of Greek shoppers visiting to purchase cheaper domestic products.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Other key partners are Germany, Italy, the United States, Slovenia, Austria and Turkey.

===Municipalities===
{{Main|Municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia}}

In August 2004, the Republic of Macedonia was reorganised into 84 municipalities (''{{lang|mk|opštini}}''; sing. ''{{lang|mk|opština}}''); 10 of the municipalities constitute the [[Greater Skopje|City of Skopje]], a distinct unit of local self-government and the country's capital.

Most of the current municipalities were unaltered or merely amalgamated from the previous 123 municipalities established in September 1996; others were consolidated and their borders changed. Prior to this, local government was organised into 34 administrative districts, communes, or counties (also opštini).

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the majority faith of the Republic of Macedonia making up 64.7% of the population, the vast majority of which belong to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. Various other [[Christian denomination]]s account for 0.37% of the population. Muslims comprise 33.3% of the population; Macedonia has the fifth-highest proportion of Muslims in Europe, after those of [[Turkey]] (96%), [[Kosovo]] (90%), [[Albania]] (60%), and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (45%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslims are [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], or [[Romani people|Romani]], although few are [[Macedonian Muslims]].

Altogether, there were 1,842 churches and 580 mosques in the country at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnevnik&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/?ItemID=A080C78F46FF724BB7AA82A63C63251E|title=Во Македонија има 1.842 цркви и 580 џамии|date=28 December 2011|publisher=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje. There is an Orthodox [[Seminary|theological college]] in the capital. The Macedonian Orthodox Church has jurisdiction over 10 provinces (seven in the country and three abroad), has 10 bishops and about 350 priests. A total of 30,000 people are baptised in all the provinces every year.

There is a tension between the Macedonian and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]es which arose from the former's separation and self-declared [[autocephaly]] in 1967. After the negotiations between the two churches were suspended, the Serbian Orthodox Church recognised a group led by Zoran Vraniškovski (also known as [[Archbishop Jovan VI of Ohrid|Archbishop Jovan of Ohrid]], a former Macedonian church bishop, as the [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric|Archbishop of Ohrid]].

The reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the new Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering Macedonia. Bishop Jovan was jailed for 18&amp;nbsp;months for &quot;defaming the Macedonian Orthodox church and harming the religious feelings of local citizens&quot; by distributing Serbian Orthodox church calendars and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=257037&amp;apc_state=henibcr200508 |title=Church Rivalry Threatens to Brim Over |publisher=Iwpr.net |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Macedonian Byzantine Catholic Church]] has approximately 11,000 adherents in Macedonia. The Church was established in 1918, and is made up mostly of converts to Catholicism and their descendants. The Church is of the [[Byzantine Rite]] and is in communion with the Roman and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Its liturgical worship is performed in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|mk|Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Македонска ханукија - מקדוני חנוכייה - Macedonian Hanukkah menorah.jpg|thumb|left|A 19th-century Macedonian silver [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah Menorah]]]]

There is a small [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community. The most famous Protestant in the country is the late president [[Boris Trajkovski]]. He was from the [[Methodism|Methodist]] community, which is the largest and oldest Protestant church in the Republic, dating back to the late 19th century. Since the 1980s the Protestant community has grown, partly through new confidence and partly with outside missionary help.

The Macedonian [[Judaism|Jewish community]], which numbered some 7,200 people on the eve of World War II, was almost entirely destroyed during the war: only [[Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia|2% of Macedonian Jews survived]] the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/2007/03/14/macedonia%E2%80%99s-jewish-community-commemorates-the-holocaust-and-embraces-the-future/ |title=Blog Archives » Macedonia's Jewish Community Commemorates the Holocaust, and Embraces the Future |publisher=Balkanalysis.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their liberation and the end of the War, most opted to emigrate to [[Israel]]. Today, the country's Jewish community numbers approximately 200 persons, almost all of whom live in Skopje. Most Macedonian Jews are [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]]&amp;nbsp;– the descendants of 15th-century refugees who had fled the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s.

According to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/publikacii/knigaIX.pdf |title=naslovna-9PUB |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official and most widely spoken language is [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], which belongs to the Eastern branch of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] language group. In municipalities where ethnic groups are represented with over 20% of the total population, the language of that ethnic group is co-official.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.president.gov.mk/en/about-macedonia/basic-facts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonian is closely related to and [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Bulgarian language|Standard Bulgarian]]. It also has some similarities with standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and the intermediate [[Torlak]]ian and [[Shopi|Shop]] dialects spoken mostly in southern Serbia and western Bulgaria (and by speakers in the north and east of Macedonia). The [[standard language]] was [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the period following [[World War II]] and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. Although it is the only language explicitly designated as an official [[national language]] in the constitution, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is part of another [[minority group|ethnic minority]], those individual languages are used for official purposes in local government, alongside Macedonian.

According to the last census, 1,344,815 Macedonian citizens declared that they spoke Macedonian, 507,989 declared [[Albanian language|Albanian]], 71,757 [[Turkish language|Turkish]], 38,528 [[Romani language|Romani]], 6,884 [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], 24,773 [[Serbian language|Serbian]], 8,560 [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and 19,241 spoke other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf Macedonian census, language and religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of languages are spoken in Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Besides the official national language, Macedonian, [[minority language]]s with substantial numbers of speakers are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (including [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish language|Balkan Gagauz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Serbian language|Serbian]]/[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (including [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Document&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/974c7c980fa0cce7802566870032a38e?Opendocument|title=Core document forming part of the reports of States Parties : The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurominority&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/eng/minority-state2.asp?id_states=28|title=Macedonia ethnic and linguistic minorities|publisher=Eurominority |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/maps/map-european-languages.asp|title=Map of the European languages|publisher=Eurominority|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/83/1983-004-1B1C7082.gif|title=Indo-European languages in contemporary Eurasia|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/macedonia.shtml|title=BBC: Languages across Europe&amp;nbsp;– Macedonia|publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eupedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/maps_of_europe.shtml#languages|title=Europe languages map|publisher=Eupedia|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few villages of [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] speakers and an immigrant [[Greek language|Greek]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Lewis, M.

The [[history of film]] making in the republic dates back over 110&amp;nbsp;years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in Bitola. Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at [[film festival]]s around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards. The first Macedonian feature film was ''Frosina'', released in 1952.

===Culture===
{{Main|Macedonian culture (Slavic)|List of Macedonians (ethnic group)|Music of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Robevci house.jpg|thumb|[[Robevi family house]]&amp;nbsp;– typical Macedonian architecture]]
Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry, and music. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually. [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian music]] styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music. Macedonia has a significant number of preserved Byzantine fresco paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of [[fresco|fresco painting]] preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting.

The most important cultural events in the country are the [[Ohrid]] Summer festival of classical music and drama, the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]] which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, International Camera Festival in [[Bitola]], Open Youth Theatre and [[Skopje Jazz Festival]] in Skopje etc.
The [[Macedonian Opera]] opened in 1947 with a performance of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' under the direction of Branko Pomorisac. Every year, the May Opera Evenings are held in Skopje for around 20 nights. The first May Opera performance was that of [[Kiril Makedonski]]'s ''Tsar Samuil'' in May 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=19442&amp;rub=35 |title=Macedonian Opera Marks 60th Anniversary.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Тавче гравче.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tavče Gravče]]]]
Macedonian cuisine is a representative of that of the [[Balkans]]—reflecting [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] ([[Greek cuisine|Greek]]) and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] ([[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]]) influences, and to a lesser extent [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[German cuisine|German]] and Eastern European (especially [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]) ones. The relatively warm climate in Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.

Famous for its rich [[Šopska salad]], an appetiser and side dish which accompanies almost every meal, Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tavče Gravče]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of the Republic of Macedonia, respectively.

===Sport===
[[File:The Macedonian Basketball Team.JPG|thumb|Macedonia basketball team at a time out during a match with [[Latvia]]]]
[[Association football|Football]] and [[team handball|handball]] are the most popular sports in Macedonia. The [[Macedonia national football team|national football team]] is controlled by the [[Football Federation of Macedonia]]. Their home stadium is the [[Philip II Arena]].

Handball is the other important team sport in the country. In 2002 Kometal Skopje won the [[EHF Champions League|EHF Women's Champions League]] European Cup. The [[European Women's Handball Championship]] took place in 2008 in Macedonia. The venues in which the tournament took place were located in Skopje and Ohrid; the [[Macedonia women's national handball team|national team]] finished seventh place.

The [[Macedonian national basketball team]] represents the Republic of Macedonia in international basketball. The team is run by the Basketball Federation of Macedonia, the governing body of basketball in Macedonia which was created in 1992 and joined FIBA in 1993. Macedonia has participated in three [[Eurobasket]]s since then with its best finish at 4th place in [[EuroBasket 2011|2011]]. It plays its home games at the [[Boris Trajkovski Arena]] in [[Skopje]].

In the summer months The [[Ohrid Swimming Marathon]] is an annual event on [[Lake Ohrid]] and during the winter months there is skiing in Macedonia's winter sports centres. Macedonia also takes part in the Olympic Games. Participation in the Games is organised by the Macedonian Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World InfoZone|url=http://worldinfozone.com/country.php?country=Macedonia&amp;page=2|title=Macedonia Information |publisher=worldinfozone.com |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federated States of Micronesia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Micronesia.ogg|ˌ|m|aɪ|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|n|iː|ʒ|ə}}; abbreviated '''FSM''') is an independent [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] [[island nation]] and a [[United States]] [[associated state]] consisting of four [[Federal state|states]]{{spaced ndash}} from west to east, [[Yap State|Yap]], [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], [[Pohnpei State|Pohnpei]] and [[Kosrae State|Kosrae]]{{spaced ndash}}that are spread across the [[Western Pacific Ocean]]. Together, the states comprise around 607 islands (a combined [[land area]] of approximately {{convert|702|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) that cover a [[Longitude|longitudinal]] distance of almost {{convert|2700|km|0|abbr=on}} just north of the [[equator]]. They lie northeast of [[New Guinea]], south of [[Guam]] and the [[Marianas]], west of [[Nauru]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], east of [[Palau]] and the [[Philippines]], about {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} north of eastern [[Australia]] and some {{convert|4000|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of the main islands of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

While the FSM's total land area is quite small, it occupies more than {{convert|2600000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Ocean]], giving the country the 14th largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/01/daily-chart-10?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/dc/st/dropsintheocean The Economist]&lt;/ref&gt; The capital is [[Palikir]], located on [[Pohnpei Island]], while the largest city is [[Weno]], located in the [[Chuuk Atoll]].

Each of its four states is centered on one or more main [[high island]]s, and all but Kosrae include numerous outlying [[atoll]]s. The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the [[Caroline Islands]] in the wider region of [[Micronesia]], which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term ''Micronesia'' may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.

The FSM was formerly a part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI), a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986 under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (RMI) and the [[Republic of Palau]] (ROP). The FSM has a seat in the United Nations.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Federated States of Micronesia}}
The ancestors of the Micronesians settled over four thousand years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Yap.

[[Nan Madol]], consisting of a series of small [[artificial island]]s linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about [[Anno Domini|AD]] 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.

European explorers—first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in search of the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] ([[Indonesia]]) and then the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]—reached the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the [[Spanish East Indies]] and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of ''Santiago de la Ascension'' in what today is [[Kolonia]] on the island of Pohnpei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micsem.org/pubs/books/catholic/pohnpei/index.htm The Catholic Church in Pohnpei]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]], the Spanish sold the archipelago to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899 under the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany incorporated it into [[German New Guinea]].

During [[World War I]], it was captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the war, the [[League of Nations]] awarded a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] for Japan to administer the islands as part of the [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|South Pacific Mandate]].

During [[World War II]], a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in [[Truk Lagoon]]. In February 1944, [[Operation Hailstone]], one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.

Following World War II, it was administered by the [[United States]] under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].

On May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] chose not to participate. The FSM signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683|Security Council Resolution 683]]. The Compact was renewed in 2004.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

The Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the 1979 constitution, which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators—one from each state—serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.

The president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.

In international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly - Overall Votes - Comparison with U.S. vote] lists Micronesia as in the country with the fourth high coincidence of votes. Micronesia has always been in the top four.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View of Kolonia Town from Sokehs Ridge in [[Pohnpei]].]]
{{main|Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

The Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 [[island]]s extending {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} across the [[archipelago]] of the [[Caroline Islands]] east of the [[Philippines]]. The islands have a combined area of {{convert|702|km2|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia-fsm /&gt;

The islands are grouped into four states, which are Yap, Chuuk (called Truk until January 1990), [[Pohnpei State|Pohnpei]] (known as &quot;Ponape&quot; until November 1984), and [[Kosrae]] (formerly Kusaie). These four states are each represented by a white star on the national flag. The capital is [[Palikir]], on Pohnpei.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

Economic activity in the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily of [[subsistence farming]] and [[fishing]]. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade [[phosphate]]. [[longline fishing|Long line]] fishing of [[tuna]] is also viable with foreign vessels from [[China]] operated in the 1990s. The potential for a [[tourist industry]] exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. [[United States foreign aid|Financial assistance from the U.S.]] is the primary source of revenue, with the U.S. pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in 1986–2001; the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] lists high dependence on U.S. aid as one of the main concerns of the FSM.&lt;ref name=cia-fsm&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|fm|Federated States of Micronesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/SIDS-states/profiles/fed_st_micronesia.htm |title=Federated States of Micronesia |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The Federated States of Micronesia is served by four international airports.
* [[Pohnpei International Airport]], on the main island of [[Pohnpei State]].
* [[Chuuk International Airport]], located on the main island of [[Chuuk State]].
* [[Kosrae International Airport]], located on the main island of [[Kosrae State]].
* [[Yap International Airport]], located on the main island of [[Yap State]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

The indigenous population of the nation, which is predominantly Micronesian, consists of various ethnolinguistic groups. It has a nearly 100% Pacific Islander and Asian population. [[Chuukese people|Chuukese]] 48.8%, Pohnpeian 24.2%, Kosraean 6.2%, Yapese 5.2%, Yap outer islands 4.5%, [[Asian ethnic groups|Asian]] 1.8%, [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] 1.5%, other 6.4%, unknown 1.4%. A sizeable minority also have some [[Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia|Japanese ancestry]], which is a result of intermarriages between Japanese settlers and Micronesians during the Japanese colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr12120a.htm President Emanuel Mori Meets With Japan Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda]; [http://www.aesonline.org/3056 AESonline.org] Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a growing expatriate population of Americans, Australians, Europeans, and residents from China and the Philippines since the 1990s. [[English language|English]] has become the common language of the government, and for secondary and tertiary education. Outside of the main capital towns of the four FSM states, the local languages are primarily spoken. Population growth remains high at more than 3% annually, offset somewhat by net emigration. Pohnpei is notable for the prevalence of the extreme form of [[color blindness]] known as [[Pingelap#Color-blindness|maskun]].

==Culture==
[[File:Yap Stone Money.jpg|thumb|A large (approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;m or about 8&amp;nbsp;ft in height) example of Yapese stone money ([[Rai stones]]) in the village of Gachpar.]]
{{see also|Music of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

Each of the four States has its own culture and traditions, but there are also common cultural and economic bonds that are centuries old. For example, cultural similarities like the importance of the traditional extended family and clan systems can be found on all the islands.

The island of Yap is notable for its &quot;stone money&quot; ([[Rai stones]]), large disks usually of calcite, up to 4&amp;nbsp;m (about 13&amp;nbsp;ft)  in diameter, with a hole in the middle. The islanders, aware of the owner of a piece, do not necessarily move them when ownership changes. There are five major types: ''Mmbul'', ''Gaw'', ''Ray'', ''Yar'', and ''Reng'', the last being only  {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}}  in diameter. Their value is based on both size and history, many of them having been brought from other islands, as far as [[New Guinea]], but most coming in ancient times from [[Palau]].

In October 2002, the Palestinian Legislative Council adopted the Law on the Capital, which stipulates that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian State, the main seat of its three branches of government. The State of Palestine is the sovereign of Jerusalem and of its holy places. Any statute or agreement that diminishes the rights of the Palestinian State in Jerusalem is invalid. This statute can be amended only with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Council. The 2003 Basic Law also asserts that Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Palestine.}} Reprinted from: [[Rüdiger Wolfrum|Wolfrum, Rüdiger]] (ed.) (online 2008-, print 2011).

{{Further|Palestine (region)#Etymology|Timeline of the name &quot;Palestine&quot;}}
Since the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], the term &quot;[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]&quot; has been associated with the geographical area that currently covers the State of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 1999, {{Google books |id=A9FVtIjyFtYC |page=186 |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: The Arab world }}.&lt;/ref&gt; General use of the term &quot;Palestine&quot; or related terms to the area at the southeast corner of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] beside [[Syria]] has [[Timeline of the name &quot;Palestine&quot;|historically been taking place]] since the times of [[Ancient Greece]], with [[Herodotus]] writing of a &quot;district of Syria, called Palaistine&quot; in which [[Phoenicians]] interacted with other maritime peoples in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Herodotus, Volume 4''.

==History==
{{main|History of the State of Palestine}}
In 1947, the UN adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan]] for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] declared the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] according to the proposed UN plan. The [[Arab Higher Committee]] did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Egypt]], and the other members of the [[Arab League]] of the time, commenced military action resulting in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were expected to form part of the Arab state under the UN plan. Egypt [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied]] the Gaza Strip and Transjordan [[Jordanian occupation of the West Bank|occupied]] the West Bank. Egypt initially supported the creation of an [[All-Palestine Government]], but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form [[Jordan]]. The annexation was ratified in 1950 but was rejected by the international community. The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Egypt, Jordan, and [[Syria]] fought against Israel, ended with Israel being in occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, besides other territories.

In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The [[Palestinian National Charter]] of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but later relocated to [[Lebanon]] after [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] in 1971.

The October [[1974 Arab League summit]] designated the PLO as the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot; and reaffirmed &quot;their right to establish an independent state of urgency.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=al Madfai, Madiha Rashid |year=1993 |title=Jordan, the United States and the Middle East Peace Process, 1974–1991 |series=Cambridge Middle East Library |volume=28 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-41523-1 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] granting them [[Member states of the United Nations#Observers and non-members|observer status]] as a &quot;non-state entity&quot; at the UN.&lt;ref name=GA3237&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/3237(XXIX) |body=A |type=R |session=29 |resolution_number=3237 (XXIX) |title=Observer status for the Palestine Liberation Organization |date=22 November 1974 |meeting=2296th plenary meeting |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isolated States: A Comparative Analysis |series=Cambridge Studies in International Relations |volume=15 |page=155 |author=Geldenhuys, Deon |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-40268-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknowledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation &quot;Palestine&quot; instead of &quot;Palestine Liberation Organization&quot; in the UN.&lt;ref name=GA43177&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/43/117 |body=A |type=R |session=43 |resolution_number=43/117 |title=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date=8 December 1988 |meeting=75th plenary meeting |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tim |last1=Hillier |title=Sourcebook on Public International Law |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-84314-380-2 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |url={{Google books |id=ukWq9mMUeesC |page=205 |plainurl=yes }} |pages=205 |publisher=Cavendish Publishing |edition=Cavendish Publishing sourcebook series}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/55/PV.54 |body=A |type=A |session=55 |document_number=36 |title=Bethlehem 2000 Draft resolution (A/55/L.3) |page=10 |meeting=54th plenary meeting |date=7 November 2000 |meetingtime=3 p.m. |speakername=[[Nasser al-Qudwa|Al-Kidwa, Nasser]] |speakernation=Palestine |language=Arabic |accessdate=10 June 2014}} &quot;Moreover, we are confident that in the near future we will truly be able to join the international community, represented in the Organization as Palestine, the State that encompasses Bethlehem.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, through the [[Camp David Accords]], Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan [[Jordan's disengagement from the West Bank|ceded its claims to the West Bank]]—with the exception of guardianship over [[Haram al-Sharif]]—to the PLO. In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the &quot;State of Palestine&quot;. In the month following, it was quickly recognised by many states, including Egypt and Jordan. In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the &quot;Palestinian territory&quot;, without explicitly specifying further. Because of this, some of the countries that recognised the State of Palestine in their statements of recognition refer to the &quot;1967 borders&quot;, thus recognizing as its territory only the occupied Palestinian territory, and not Israel. The UN membership application submitted by the State of Palestine also specified that it is based on the &quot;1967 borders&quot;.&lt;ref name=only1967 /&gt; During the negotiations of the Oslo Accords, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist, and Israel recognised the PLO as representative of the Palestinian people. Between 1993 and 1998, the PLO made commitments to change the provisions of its Palestinian National Charter that are inconsistent with the aim for a two-state solution and peaceful coexistence with Israel.

After Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish [[Israeli settlement]]s there. These were organised into [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria district]] (West Bank) and [[Hof Aza Regional Council]] (Gaza Strip) in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]]. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the [[Israeli Civil Administration]] of the [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] and by local [[Municipality (Palestinian Authority)|municipal councils]] present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arij.org/atlas40/chapter2.3.html|title=40 Years Of Israeli Occupation|work=arij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, in the [[Oslo Accords]], [[Israel]] acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as &quot;representing the Palestinian people&quot;, in return for the PLO recognizing Israel's right to exist in peace, acceptance of [[UN Security Council resolution]]s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]], and its rejection of &quot;violence and terrorism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Kim |last1=Murphy |title=Israel and PLO, in Historic Bid for Peace, Agree to Mutual Recognition : Mideast: After decades of conflict, accord underscores both sides' readiness to coexist.

As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA. It was given civilian control in [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area B]] and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in Area C. In 2005, following the implementation of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, the PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and [[territorial waters]].{{ref label|control|iii|}} Following the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict|inter-Palestinian conflict]] in 2006, [[Hamas]] took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and [[Fatah]] took control of the West Bank. From 2007, the Gaza Strip was [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|governed by]] Hamas, and the West Bank by Fatah.

These should be distinguished from the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]], [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] (PLC) and [[Palestinian government of June 2007|PNA Cabinet]], all of which are instead associated with the Palestinian National Authority.

The State of Palestine's founding document is the Palestinian Declaration of Independence,&lt;ref name=declaration1988 /&gt; and it should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO [[Palestinian National Covenant]] and PNA [[Palestine Basic Law]].

The governorates in the West Bank are grouped into [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|three areas per the Oslo II Accord]].

East Jerusalem, the proclaimed capital of Palestine, is administered as part of the [[Jerusalem District]] of Israel, but is claimed by Palestine as part of the [[Jerusalem Governorate]]. It was annexed by Israel in 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zahriyeh2014&quot;/&gt; but this annexation is not recognised by any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tobias|last=Kelly|title=Laws of Suspicion:Legal Status, Space and the Impossibility of Separation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank|editor1-first=Franz|editor1-last=Von Benda-Beckmann|editor2-first=Keebet|editor2-last=Von Benda-Beckmann|editor3-first=Julia M.|editor3-last=Eckert|work=Rules of Law and Laws of Ruling: On the Governance of Law|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|date=May 2009|p=91|isbn=9780754672395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 456,000 people in East Jerusalem, roughly 60% are Palestinians and 40% are Israelis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zahriyeh2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChoshenEtKorach2010&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://jiis.org/.upload/facts-2010-eng%20%281%29.pdf|format=PDF|title=Jerusalem, Facts and Trends 2009/2010|page=11|publisher=[[Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies]]|accessdate=8 August 2014|archivedate=2 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702001634/http://jiis.org/.upload/facts-2010-eng%20%281%29.pdf|deadurl=no|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{See also|Foreign relations of Palestine|List of diplomatic missions of Palestine|List of diplomatic missions to Palestine}}
Representation of the State of Palestine is performed by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). In states that recognise the State of Palestine it maintains [[Embassy|embassies]]. The Palestine Liberation Organization is represented in various international organizations as member, associate or observer. Because of inconclusiveness in sources&lt;ref&gt;Such as listing &quot;Palestine&quot; or [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]] without further explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases it is impossible to distinguish whether the participation is executed by the PLO as representative of the State of Palestine, by the PLO as a non-state entity or by the PNA.

===International recognition===
[[File:Palestine recognition only.svg|right|thumb|350px|International recognition of the State of Palestine]]
{{Main|International recognition of the State of Palestine|Palestine 194}}
On 15 December 1988, the State of Palestine's [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] of November 1988 was acknowledged in the General Assembly with [[Resolution 43/177]].&lt;ref&gt;UNGA, 15 December 1988; [http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/146E6838D505833F852560D600471E25 ''Resolution 43/177.

{{Numrec|Pal|link=N|asof=S}} ({{Numrec|Pal|link=N|pcent=UN}}) of the {{UNnum}} member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine. Many of the countries that do not recognise the State of Palestine nevertheless recognise the PLO as the &quot;representative of the [[Palestinian people]]&quot;. The PLO's [[Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization|executive committee]] is empowered by the PNC to perform the functions of government of the State of Palestine.&lt;ref name=GiE /&gt;

On 29 November 2012,&lt;ref name=GA11317 /&gt; [[UN General Assembly resolution 67/19]] passed, upgrading Palestine to &quot;[[Observer status|non-member observer state]]&quot; status in the United Nations.&lt;ref name=A67L28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AljazeeraNmChng&gt;{{cite web |title=Palestine: What is in a name (change)? |date=8 January 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |website=Aljazeera Inside Story |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2013/01/2013186722389860.html |archive-url=//web.archive.org/web/20130109160021/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2013/01/2013186722389860.html |archive-date=9 January 2013 |deadurl=no |publisher=[[Aljazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in status was described as &quot;''[[de facto]]'' recognition of the [[sovereign state]] of Palestine&quot;.&lt;ref name=UNStatehoodBid2012accepted&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel defies UN after vote on Palestine with plans for 3,000 new homes in the West Bank|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-defies-un-after-vote-on-palestine-with-plans-for-3000-new-homes-in-the-west-bank-8372494.html|publisher=The Independent|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2014, new [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]] used his inaugural address in parliament to announce that Sweden would recognise the state of Palestine. The official decision to do so was made on 30 October, making Sweden the first EU member state outside of the former communist bloc to recognise the state of Palestine. Most of the EU's 28 member states have refrained from recognising Palestinian statehood and those that do - such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - did so before accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beaumont |first=Peter |date=3 October 2014 |title=Sweden to recognise state of Palestine |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/sweden-recognise-state-palestine |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 October 2014 |title=Sweden officially recognises state of Palestine |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/sweden-officially-recognises-state-palestine |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- The citation by the government --&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallström, Minister for Foreign Affairs |first=Margot |date=30 October 2014 |title=Sweden today decides to recognise the State of Palestine |url=http://www.dn.se/debatt/sweden-today-decides-to-recognise-the-state-of-palestine/ |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |location=Stockholm |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2014, the UK House of Commons voted by 274 to 12 in favour of recognising Palestine as a state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/chan40.pdf HC Deb 13 October 2014 cc61-131]&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Commons backed the move &quot;as a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution&quot; - although less than half of MPs took part in the vote. However, the UK government is not bound to do anything as a result of the vote: its current policy is that it &quot;reserves the right to recognise a Palestinian state bilaterally at the moment of our choosing and when it can best help bring about peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29596822   |title=MPs back Palestinian statehood alongside Israel |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 October 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2014, the [[National Assembly (France)|French parliament]] voted by 331 to 151 in favour of urging their government to recognise Palestine as a state.

On 31 December 2014, the United Nations Security Council voted down a resolution demanding the end of Israeli occupation and statehood by 2017. Eight members voted for the Resolution (Russia, China, France, Argentina, Chad, Chile, Jordan, Luxembourg), however following strenuous US and Israeli efforts to defeat the resolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/us-israel-un-reject-palestinian-resolution-nigeria-security-council|title=US and Israeli intervention led UN to reject Palestinian resolution|author=Peter Beaumont|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not get the minimum of nine votes needed to pass the resolution.

On 10 January 2015, the first Palestinian embassy in a western European country is open in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/02/10/397046/Palestine-to-open-Sweden-embassy |title=Palestine opens first W Europe embassy in Sweden |date=10 February 2015 |accessdate=21 April 2015 |website=PressTV |publisher=PressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced it was shifting recognition from the PLO to the State of Palestine, confirming a recognition of Palestine as a state after the UN vote of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=765399 'PLO: Vatican accord with Palestine a contribution to justice,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 14 May 2015.:&quot;The Holy See has identified the State of Palestine as such since the vote&quot; by the UN general assembly to recognize it in November 2012, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told AFP.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsignor Antoine Camilleri, Vatican foreign minister, said the change was in line with the evolving position of the Holy See, which has referred unofficially to the State of Palestine since [[Pope Francis]]'s visit to the Holy Land in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c5550d535218478c8208fe32c82c3eb3/vatican-recognizes-state-palestine-new-treaty |title=Vatican recognizes state of Palestine in new treaty |accessdate=21 April 2015 |website=bigstory.ap.org|publisher=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2015 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution demanding Palestinian sovereignty over the natural resources in the Palestinian territories under Israeli occupation. It called on Israel to desist from the exploitation, damage, cause of loss or depletion and endangerment of Palestinian natural resources, the right of Palestinians to seek restitution for extensive destruction. The motion was passed by 164 votes to 5, with Canada, [[Federated States of Micronesia]], Israel, [[Marshall Islands]], and the United States opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=769475 'UN adopts resolution on Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 23 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
{{main|Legal status of the State of Palestine}}
There are a wide variety of views regarding the status of the State of Palestine, both among the states of the international community and among legal scholars. The existence of a state of Palestine, although controversial, is a reality in the opinions of the states that have established bilateral diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Jerome M., Chapter 9, &quot;The State of Palestine, The Question of Existence&quot;, in Philosophical perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Tomis Kapitan editor, M.E.

[[Palestinian Jews]]&amp;nbsp;– considered Palestinian by the [[Palestinian National Charter]] adopted by the PLO which defined them as those &quot;Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] invasion&quot;&amp;nbsp;– today identify as Israelis{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} (with the exception of a very few individuals). Palestinian Jews almost universally abandoned any such identity after the establishment of Israel and their incorporation into the [[Demographics of Israel|Israeli Jewish]] population, largely composed of [[Aliyah|Jewish immigrants]] from around the world.

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism in the Palestinian territories}}
Tourism in the Palestinian territories refers to [[tourism]] in [[East Jerusalem]], the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were domestic.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=423693|title=PCBS: Marked increase in West Bank tourism in 2010|last=M'aan|first=|date=26 September 2011|work=M'aan|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of international visits is misleading, however, since most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a day trip itinerary. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travel-impact-newswire.com/2013/03/europeans-dominate-visitor-arrivals-to-palestine-in-2012/#story3&lt;/ref&gt; Major travel guides write that &quot;the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Israel and the Palestinian Territories. p254. Lonely Planet Publications. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister [[Rula Ma'ay'a]] stated that her government aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the occupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a major income source to Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.wafa.ps/index.php?action=detail&amp;id=22622&lt;/ref&gt; There are no visa conditions imposed on foreign nationals other than those imposed by&amp;nbsp;the visa policy of Israel. Access to&amp;nbsp;Jerusalem, the&amp;nbsp;West Bank, and Gaza&amp;nbsp;is completely controlled by the Government of Israel..Entry to the occupied Palestinian territories requires only a valid international passport.&lt;ref&gt;http://jerusalem.usconsulate.gov/border-crossings.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
{{main|Communications in the Palestinian territories}}
The communications infrastructure in the [[Palestinian territories]] is growing at a very rapid pace and continually being updated and expanded.

===Transportation===

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}
Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories are characterized by severe water shortage and are highly influenced by the Israeli occupation. The water resources of Palestine are fully controlled by Israel and the division of groundwater is subject to provisions in the [[Oslo II Accord]].

Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the [[Gaza strip]] when compared to the [[West Bank]]. About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is [[Non-revenue water|lost in the distribution network]]. The lasting blockade of the Gaza Strip and the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Gaza&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''São Tomé and Príncipe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|aʊ|_|t|ə|ˈ|m|eɪ|_|ən|_|ˈ|p|r|ɪ|n|s|ɨ|p|ə}} {{respell|SOW|tə|MAY|ən}} {{respell|PRIN|si-pə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɪ|n|s|ɨ|p|eɪ}} {{respell|PRIN|si-pay}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/sao-tome#americanheritage |title=São Tomé - Definition of São Tomé |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ tuˈmɛ i ˈpɾĩsɨpɨ}}) officially the '''Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe''', is a Portuguese-speaking [[island nation]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]], off the western equatorial coast of [[Central Africa]]. It consists of two [[archipelago]]s around the two main islands: [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]], located about {{convert|140|km|mi|0}} apart and about {{convert|250|and|225|km|mi|0}}, respectively, off the northwestern coast of [[Gabon]].

The islands were uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century. Gradually colonized and settled by Portugal throughout the 16th century, they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the equator made São Tomé and Príncipe ideal for sugar cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as coffee and cocoa; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful independence in 1975. São Tomé and Príncipe has since remained one of Africa's most stable and democratic countries.

With a population of 192,993 (2013 Census), São Tomé and Príncipe is the second-smallest African country after [[Seychelles]], as well as the smallest [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking country. Its people are predominantly of African and ''[[mestiço]]'' descent, with most adhering to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country's culture, customs, and music, which fuse European and African influences.

==History==
{{Main|History of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe were uninhabited when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived sometime around 1470. The islands were discovered by [[João de Santarém]] and [[Pêro Escobar]]. Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.

The dates of discovery are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]), 1471 for São Tomé, and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Anthony's Day]]), 1472 for Príncipe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saotomeprincipe-roma.it/cms/front_content.php?idcat=42 History]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources give different nearby years. Príncipe was initially named ''Santo Antão'' (&quot;Saint Anthony&quot;), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Príncipe'' (&quot;Prince's Island&quot;), in reference to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.

The first successful settlement of São Tomé was established in 1493 by [[Álvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown. Príncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were &quot;undesirables&quot; sent from Portugal, mostly [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |title=The Expulsion 1492 Chronicles, section XI: &quot;The Vale of Tears&quot;, quoting Joseph Hacohen (1496-1577); also, section XVII, quoting 16th century author Samuel Usque |publisher=Aish.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of [[sugar]].

The cultivation of sugar was a labor-intensive process and the Portuguese began to import large numbers of [[Slavery|slaves]] from the mainland. By the mid-16th century the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar. São Tomé and Príncipe were taken over and administered by the Portuguese crown in 1522 and 1573, respectively.

However, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large slave population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, the economy of São Tomé had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between the West and continental Africa.

In the early 19th century, two new cash crops, [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], were introduced. The rich volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (known as &quot;roças&quot;), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland. By 1908, São Tomé had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop.

The roças system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in São Tomé in its 13 March 1897 issue.

In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[Angola]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This &quot;[[Batepá Massacre]]&quot; remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government.

===Independence (1975)===
[[Image:Sao tome se.jpg|thumb|250px|The cathedral - Sé - of [[São Tomé]].]]
By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African Continent were demanding independence, a small group of São Toméans had formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby Gabon. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974.

The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies – in November 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, São Tomé and Príncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].

In 1990, São Tomé became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution – the legalization of opposition political parties – led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in São Tomé's second multi-party presidential election in 1996.

The [[Democratic Convergence Party – Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] (PCD) won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe|National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the Assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.

Presidential elections were held in July 2001. The candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments were formed.

The army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] period ended in March 2006, when a pro-presidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;For an in depth analysis of post-colonial history up to this point see Gerhard Seibert, ''Comrades, Clients and Cousins: Colonialism, Socialism and Democratization in São Tomé and Príncipe'', Leiden: Brill, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 30 July 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates [[Patrice Trovoada]] (son of former President Miguel Trovoada) and independent [[Nilo Guimarães]]. Local elections, the first since 1992, took place on 27 August 2006 and were dominated by members of the ruling coalition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} On 12 February 2009, there was an attempted coup d'état to overthrow President Fradique de Menezes. The coup plotters were imprisoned, but later received a pardon from President de Menezes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orange.co.bw/news/?m=201001&amp;paged=450 Sao Tome president pardons coup plotter]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}. Orange Botswana Portal. January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
[[Image:Manuel Pinto da Costa.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]] in 1986.]]

The president of the republic is elected to a five-year term by direct [[universal suffrage]] and a [[secret ballot]], and must gain an outright majority to be elected. The president may hold up to two consecutive terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president, and the fourteen members of cabinet are chosen by the prime minister.

The [[National Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe|National Assembly]], the supreme organ of the state and the highest legislative body, is made up of 55 members, who are elected for a four-year term and meet semiannually. Justice is administered at the highest level by the Supreme Court. The judiciary is independent under the current constitution.

===Political culture===
São Tomé has functioned under a multiparty system since 1990. With regards to [[Human rights in São Tomé and Príncipe|human rights in São Tomé]], there exists the freedom of speech and the freedom to form opposition political parties.

São Tomé and Príncipe finished 11th out of the African countries measured by the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]] in 2010, a comprehensive reflection of the levels of governance in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/media/get/20101108_eng-table-iiag2010-revised.pdf |title=2010 Ibrahim Index of African Governance |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111019173824/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/media/get/20101108_eng-table-iiag2010-revised.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Further|Foreign relations of São Tomé and Príncipe}}

São Tomé and Príncipe has embassies in Angola, Gabon, Portugal, Belgium, Taiwan, and the USA. It also has a permanent mission to the UN in New York City and an International Diplomatic Correspondent Office.

===Military===
{{Further|Military of São Tomé and Príncipe}}

São Tomé and Príncipe's military is small and consists of four branches: the Army (''Exército''), Coast Guard (''Guarda Costeira'' also called &quot;Navy&quot;), Presidential Guard (''Guarda Presidencial''), and the National Guard.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of São Tomé and Príncipe|Districts of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
São Tomé and Príncipe is divided into 2 provinces: [[Príncipe]] and [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]].

The provinces are further divided into seven districts, six on São Tomé and one on Príncipe (with Príncipe having [[self-governance|self-government]] since 29 April 1995).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of São Tomé and Príncipe}}

[[File:Tp-map.png|thumb|250px|A map of São Tomé and Príncipe.]]
[[File:São Tomé - Pico Cão Grande.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Pico Cão Grande]].]]
The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, situated in the equatorial Atlantic and [[Gulf of Guinea]] about {{Convert|300|and|250|km|mi|-1}}, respectively, off the northwest coast of [[Gabon]], constitute Africa's second smallest country. Both are part of the [[Cameroon line|Cameroon volcanic mountain line]], which also includes the islands of [[Annobón]] to the southwest, [[Bioko]] to the northeast (both part of [[Equatorial Guinea]]), and [[Mount Cameroon]] on the coast of Gulf of Guinea.

[[File:São Tomé - Praia Café.jpg|thumb|Beach scenery in São Tomé and Príncipe.]]
São Tomé is {{Convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|30|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide and the more mountainous of the two islands. Its peaks reach {{Convert|2024|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} - [[Pico de São Tomé]]. Príncipe is about {{Convert|30|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide. Its peaks reach {{Convert|948|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} - [[Pico de Príncipe]]. Swift streams radiating down the mountains through lush forest and cropland to the sea cross both islands. The [[equator]] lies immediately south of São Tomé Island, passing through an islet [[Ilhéu das Rolas]].

The [[Pico Cão Grande]] (Great Dog Peak) is a landmark [[volcanic plug]] peak, located at {{Coord|0|7|0|N|6|34|00|E}} in southern São Tomé. It rises over {{Convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the surrounding terrain and the summit is {{Convert|663|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
At sea level, the climate is tropical—hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about {{convert|27|C|F|1}} and little daily variation. The temperature rarely rises beyond {{convert|32|C|F|1}}. At the interior's higher elevations, the average yearly temperature is {{convert|20|C|F|}}, and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} on the southwestern slopes to {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the northern lowlands. The rainy season is from October to May.

===Wildlife===
{{Main|Wildlife of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
São Tomé and Príncipe does not have a large number of native mammals (although the [[São Tomé shrew]] and several bat species are [[endemism|endemic]]). The islands are home to a larger number of endemic birds and plants, including the world's smallest ibis (the [[São Tomé ibis]]), the world's largest sunbird (the [[giant sunbird]]), the rare [[São Tomé fiscal]], and several giant species of ''[[Begonia]]''.
São Tomé and Principe is an important marine turtle nesting site, including the [[hawksbill turtle]]s (''Eretmochelys imbricata'').

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
[[File:Grainsofparadisefruits.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ossame fruit in São Tomé and Príncipe]]
Since the 19th century, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The main crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.

Domestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports most of its food.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMD&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ep5oOZ8m0PoC&amp;pg=PA206 Agricultural Marketing Directory for U.S. &amp; Africa Trade - Mary E. Lassanyi, Wayne Olson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it was estimated that approximately 90 percent of the country's food needs are met through imports.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMD&quot;/&gt; Efforts have been made by the government in recent years to expand food production, and several projects have been undertaken, largely financed by foreign donors.

[[File:In the city center, the new marketplace bustles with activity..jpg|thumb|A market place located in the city of [[São Tomé]].]]
[[File:Sao Tome and Principe Export Treemap.png|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of São Tomé's exports.]]
Other than agriculture, the main economic activities are fishing and a small industrial sector engaged in processing local agricultural products and producing a few basic consumer goods. The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.

Following independence, the country had a centrally directed economy with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a [[mixed economy]], with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of São Tomé encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Efforts to redistribute plantation land resulted in decreased cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.

In response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) [[structural adjustment]] program, and invited greater private participation in management of the parastatals, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.

The São Toméan Government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]], the European Union (EU), Portugal, [[Taiwan]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. In April 2000, in association with the [[Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe|Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipe]], the IMF approved a poverty reduction and growth facility for São Tomé aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit.

In late 2000, São Tomé qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF–World Bank's [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) initiative. The reduction is being reevaluated by the IMF, due to the attempted [[coup d'état]] in July 2003 and subsequent emergency spending. Following the truce, the IMF decided to send a mission to São Tomé to evaluate the macroeconomic state of the country. This evaluation is ongoing, reportedly pending oil legislation to determine how the government will manage incoming oil revenues which are still poorly defined, but in any case expected to change the economic situation dramatically.

In parallel, some efforts have been made to incentivize private tourism initiatives, but their scope remains limited.&lt;ref&gt;See Brígida Rocha Brito and others, ''Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos'', Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

São Tomé also hosts a broadcasting station of the American [[International Broadcasting Bureau]] (IBB) for the [[Voice of America]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WRTH1995p162&quot;&gt;''World Radio TV Handbook'' (WRTH) Vol. 49 • 1995, p. 162; [http://www.wrth.com/ Billboard Publications], Amsterdam 1995. ISBN 0-8230-5926-X&lt;/ref&gt; located at Pinheira.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRTH1997p514&quot;&gt;WRTH 1997, p. 514, ISBN 0-8230-7797-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal remains one of São Tomé's major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports. Food, manufactured articles, machinery, and transportation equipment are imported primarily from the EU.

São Tomé and Príncipe was ranked the 174th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petroleum exploration===
In 2001, São Tomé and Nigeria reached agreement on joint exploration for petroleum in waters claimed by the two countries of the [[Niger Delta province|Niger Delta geologic province]]. After a lengthy series of negotiations, in April 2003 the joint development zone (JDZ) was opened for bids by international oil firms. The JDZ was divided into nine blocks; the winning bids for block one, [[ChevronTexaco]], [[ExxonMobil]], and the Norwegian firm, Equity Energy, were announced in April 2004, with São Tomé to take in 40% of the $123&amp;nbsp;million bid, and Nigeria the other 60%. Bids on other blocks were still under consideration in October 2004. São Tomé has received more than $2 million from the bank to develop its petroleum sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phuong |last=Tran |coauthors=|authorlink=|title=São Tomé &amp; Príncipe Still Waiting for Oil Boom |date=1 February 2007 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-02-01-voa30-66537932.htmlm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522180206/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-02-01-voa30-66537932.htmlm |archivedate=2011-05-22 |work=VOA News |pages=|accessdate=25 December 2008|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking===
[[Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe|Banco Central de Sāo Tomé e Príncipe]] is the central bank, responsible for monetary policy and bank supervision. There are six banks in the country. The largest and oldest is [[Banco Internacional de São Tomé e Príncipe]], which is a subsidiary of Portugal's government-owned [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]]. It had a monopoly on commercial banking until a change in the banking law in 2003 led to the entry of several other banks.

==Society==

===Demographics===
{{Main|Demographics of São Tomé and Príncipe}}

[[Image:São Tomé and Príncipe.png|thumb|350px|São Tomé and Príncipe's population between 1961 and 2003.]]
The first ever census was carried out in 2011 with the help of the National Statistic Institute (INE) of [[Cape Verde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2011/04/06/cape-verde-supports-population-census-in-sao-tome-and-principe/ |title=Cape Verde supports population census in Sao Tome and Principe|date=6 April 2011|publisher=Inforpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of São Tomé and Príncipe's total population estimated at 163,784 by the government agency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.st/populacao.htm Domain Available :: Nic.St - The Official .St Domain Registry]. Ine.st. Retrieved on 2013-08-09. {{wayback|url=http://www.ine.st/populacao.htm |date=20110927115130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 157,500 live on São Tomé and 6,000 on Príncipe.

All are descended from people from different countries taken to the islands by the Portuguese from 1470 onwards. In the 1970s, there were two significant population movements—the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred São Tomé refugees from Angola.

===Ethnic groups===
Distinct ethnic groups on São Tomé and Príncipe include:

* ''Mestiços'', or mixed-blood, descendants of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and [[Africa]]n slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from [[Benin]], [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Angola]] (these people also are known as ''filhos da terra'' or &quot;children of the land&quot;).
* ''Angolares'', reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing.
* ''Forros'', descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished.
* ''Serviçais'', contract laborers from Angola, [[Mozambique]], and [[Cape Verde]], living temporarily on the islands.

===Education===
Education in São Tomé and Príncipe is compulsory for four years.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/sao-tome-principe.htm &quot;São Tomé and Príncipe&quot;].

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt; Primary school enrollment and attendance rates were unavailable for São Tomé and Principe as of 2001.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

The educational system has a shortage of classrooms, insufficiently trained and underpaid teachers, inadequate textbooks and materials, high rates of repetition, poor educational planning and management, and a lack of community involvement in school management.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Domestic financing of the school system is lacking, leaving the system highly dependent on foreign financing.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

Tertiary institutions are the [[National Lyceum (São Tomé and Príncipe)]] and the [[Instituto Superior Politécnico]].

São Toméan culture is a mixture of African and Portuguese influences.

===Music===
{{Further|Music of São Tomé and Príncipe}}

São Toméans are known for ússua and socopé rhythms, while Príncipe is home to the dêxa beat. Portuguese ballroom dancing may have played an integral part in the development of these rhythms and their associated dances.

Tchiloli is a musical dance performance that tells a dramatic story. The danço-Congo is similarly a combination of music, dance and theatre.

East Timor was colonised by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century, and was known as [[Portuguese Timor]] until November 1975, when the [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor]] (FRETILIN) declared the territory's independence. Nine days later, it was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupied]] by [[Indonesia]] and was declared Indonesia's [[Timor Timur|27th province]] the following year. The Indonesian occupation of East Timor was characterised by a highly violent decades-long conflict between separatist groups (especially FRETILIN) and the Indonesian military.

In 1999, following the United Nations-sponsored act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory. East Timor became the first new [[List of sovereign states|sovereign state]] of the 21st century on 20 May 2002 and joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]. In 2011, East Timor announced its intention to gain membership status in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] by applying to become its eleventh member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/218897/east-timor-bid-to-join-asean-wins-trong-support East Timor Bid to Join ASEAN Wins 'Strong Support'], Bangkok Post, date: 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of only two predominantly [[Christianity in Asia|Christian]] nations in [[Southeast Asia]], the other being [[the Philippines]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Sunrise on Tatamailau.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Timor of the rising sun&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise on Mount [[Tatamailau]]]]

&quot;Timor&quot; derives from ''timur'', the word for &quot;east&quot; in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], which became ''Timor'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and entered English as ''Portuguese Timor''. ''Leste'' is the Portuguese word for &quot;east&quot;, resulting in &quot;Timor-Leste&quot; (East-East). In [[Tetum]] the name is ''Timór Lorosa'e'', from ''Lorosa'e'' (&lt;small&gt;lit&lt;/small&gt; &quot;rising sun&quot;) the word for &quot;east&quot; in that language.

The official names under the Constitution are '''República Democrática de Timor-Leste''' in Portuguese and '''Repúblika Demokrátika Timór-Leste''' in Tetum.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) [[ISO 3166-1|official short form]] in English and all other languages is ''Timor-Leste'' (codes: TLS &amp; TL), which has been adopted by the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/833&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=European Union deploys Election Observation Mission to Timor Leste |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the national standards organisations of [[France]] ([[AFNOR]]), the [[United States]] ([[ANSI]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/p/eap/ci/tt/ |title=US Department of State: Timor Leste Country Page |publisher=State.gov |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom]] ([[BSI Group|BSI]]), [[Germany]] ([[DIN]]), and [[Sweden]] ([[Swedish Standards Institute|SIS]]), all diplomatic missions to the country by protocol and the CIA World Factbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/index.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=US Govt. |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of East Timor}}
Descendants of at least three waves of migration are believed still to live in East Timor. The first is described by anthropologists as people of the [[Vedda people|Veddo]]-[[Australoid]] type, who arrived from the north and west at least 42,000 years ago [[Australoid race|Australoid]] second are indigenous groups of [[New Guinea]] and Australia, and arrived more than 40,000 years ago. Around 3000 BC, a second migration brought Melanesians. The earlier Veddo-Australoid peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior.

The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] established outposts in Timor and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Effective European occupation of a small part of the territory began in 1769, when the city of [[Dili]] was founded and the colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] declared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/carneiroSousa.rtf&lt;/ref&gt; A definitive border between the Dutch-colonised western half of the island and the Portuguese-colonised eastern half of the island was established by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] of 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Deeley, Furness, and Schofield (2001) ''The International Boundaries of East Timor'' p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains the international boundary between the successor states East Timor and [[Indonesia]]. For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century, with minimal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. As was often the case, Portuguese rule was generally neglectful but exploitative where it existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |page=198 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-1-86373-635-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the Japanese occupied Dili, and the mountainous interior became the scene of a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign, known as the [[Battle of Timor (1942–43)|Battle of Timor]].

The 1991 [[Dili Massacre]] was a turning point for the independence cause internationally, and an [[East Timor solidarity movement]] grew in Portugal, Australia, and other western countries.

Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of Indonesian President Suharto]], a UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for a UN-supervised popular [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with a [[1999 East Timorese crisis|punitive campaign of violence]] by East Timorese [[pro-Indonesia militia|pro-integration militia]] with the support of elements of the Indonesian military. With Indonesian permission, an Australian-led international peacekeeping force was deployed until order was restored. In late 1999, the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/peace/etimor/etimor.htm |title=UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATION IN EAST TIMOR – UNTAET |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Etan/Us |url=http://www.etan.org/et2000a/february/13-19/14untake.htm |title=UN takes over East Timor command |publisher=Etan.org |date=15 February 2000 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2002, over 205,000 refugees had returned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Timor: More than 1,000 refugees return since beginning of month |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/timor-leste/east-timor-more-1000-refugees-return-beginning-month |publisher=ReliefWeb |accessdate=13 February 2013 |date=10 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and East Timorese independence was formalised on 20 May 2002 with [[Xanana Gusmão]] sworn in as the country's first President.

The [[head of state]] of East Timor is the [[President of East Timor|President of the Republic]], who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. Although his executive powers are somewhat limited, the president does have veto power over government's legislation. Following elections, the president appoints the leader of the majority party or majority [[coalition]] as the [[Prime Minister of East Timor]]. As [[head of government]], the prime minister presides over the cabinet.

The [[unicameral]] East Timorese parliament is the [[National Parliament (East Timor)|National Parliament]] or ''Parlamento Nacional'', whose members are elected by popular vote to a five-year term. The number of seats can vary from a minimum of fifty-two to a maximum of sixty-five. The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal. The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions. Government departments include the [[Polícia Nacional de Timor-Leste]] (police), East Timor Ministry for State and Internal Administration, [[Civil Aviation Division of Timor-Leste]], and Immigration Department of Timor-Leste.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Timor Leste Defence Force (''Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste'', F-FDTL) is the [[Armed forces|military body]] responsible for the defence of East Timor. The F-FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions, a small naval component, and several supporting units.

The F-FDTL's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats. It also has an internal security role, which overlaps with that of the [[National Police of East Timor]] (Polícia Nacional de Timor-Leste, PNTL). This overlap has led to tensions between the services, which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F-FDTL.

The F-FDTL's problems [[2006 East Timorese crisis|came to a head in 2006]] when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.

{{main|Demographics of East Timor}}

The population of East Timor is about 1,167,242.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The population is especially concentrated in the area around Dili.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The word ''Maubere'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Maubere|&quot;Maubere&quot; article at the German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; formerly used by the Portuguese to refer to native East Timorese and often employed as synonymous with the illiterate and uneducated, was adopted by [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor|FReTiLIn]] as a term of pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=James J. |last2=Soares |first2=Dionisio Babo |title=Out of the Ashes: Destruction and Reconstruction of East Timor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wu4yJjUqxUgC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2000 |publisher=C.

The main tribes of predominantly Papuan origin include the [[Bunak]] (50,000), in the central interior of Timor island; the [[Fataluku]] (30,000), at the eastern tip of the island near [[Lospalos]]; and the [[Makasae]], toward the eastern end of the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} As a result of [[interracial marriage]] which was common during the Portuguese era, there is a population of people of mixed East Timorese and Portuguese origin, known in Portuguese as ''[[mestiço]]s''. There is a small [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] minority, most of whom are [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka]]. Many Chinese left in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Constâncio Pinto |author2=Matthew Jardine |title=East Timor's Unfinished Struggle: Inside the East Timorese Resistance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdHlt6CSp54C&amp;pg=PA263 |year=1997 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-541-1 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of East Timor}}
[[File:Sprachen Osttimors-en.png|thumb|Major language groups in East Timor by ''[[suco]]'']]
East Timor's two official languages are [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Tetum language|Tetum]]. [[English language|English]] and [[Bahasa Indonesia]] are sometimes used and designated as working languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejakartapost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/timor-leste-tetum-portuguese-bahasa-indonesia-or-english.html |title=Timor Leste, Tetum, Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesia or English? |date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tetum belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family of languages spoken throughout Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |page=378 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-10518-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 census found that the most commonly spoken [[mother tongue]]s were [[Tetum language|Tetum Prasa]] (mother tongue for 36.6% of the population), [[Mambai language (Timor)|Mambai]] (12.5%), [[Makasai]] (9.7%), [[Tetum language|Tetum Terik]] (6.0%), [[Baikenu]] (5.9%), [[Kemak language|Kemak]] (5.9%), [[Bunak language|Bunak]] (5.3%), [[Tokodede]] (3.7%), and [[Fataluku language|Fataluku]] (3.6%). Other indigenous languages largely accounted for the remaining 10.9%, while Portuguese was spoken natively by just under 600 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Table 13: Population distribution by mother tongue, Urban Rural and District |title=Volume 2: Population Distribution by Administrative Areas |url=http://www.mof.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Publication-2-English-Web.pdf |work=Population and Housing Census of Timor-Leste, 2010 |publisher=Timor-Leste Ministry of Finance |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Indonesian rule, the use of Portuguese was banned and only Indonesian was allowed to be used in government offices, schools and public business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Max L. |title=A Muslim Archipelago: Islam and Politics in Southeast Asia: Islam and Politics in Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tm8tSwyTa7AC&amp;pg=PA119 |archiveurl=http://ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/A_Muslim_Archipelago.pdf |archivedate=Nov 21, 2002|date=14 February 2008 |publisher=Government Printing Office |isbn=978-0-16-086920-4 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Indonesian occupation, Tetum and Portuguese were important unifying elements for the East Timorese people in opposing [[Javanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarnagin |first=Laura |title=Portuguese and Luso-Asian Legacies in Southeast Asia, 1511-2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4A_RzBG4DjIC&amp;pg=PA106 |date=1 April 2012 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-981-4345-50-7 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese was adopted as one of the two official languages upon independence in 2002 for this reason and as a link to [[Lusophone]] nations in other parts of the world. It is now being taught and promoted with the help of Brazil, Portugal, and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagemagazine.com/?page_id=3465]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian and English are defined as working languages under the Constitution in the Final and Transitional Provisions, without setting a final date. Aside from Tetum, [[Ethnologue]] lists the following indigenous languages: [[Adabe language|Adabe]], Baikeno, Bunak, Fataluku, [[Galoli language|Galoli]], [[Habun language|Habun]], [[Idaté]], [[Kairui-Midiki language|Kairui-Midiki]], Kemak, [[Lakalei language|Lakalei]], Makasae, [[Makuv'a]], Mambae, [[Nauete language|Nauete]], Tukudede, and [[Waima'a language|Waima'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Languages of East Timor |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=tl |publisher=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that English is understood by 31.4% of the population. As of 2012, 35% speak, read, and write Portuguese; which is up significantly from less than 5% in the 2006 UN Development Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejakartapost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink |{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20050515233210 |url=http://jsmp.minihub.org/Reports/jsmpreports/Language%20Report/LanguageReport%28english%29.pdf |title=JSMP Report }} |295&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]], there are six endangered languages in East Timor: [[Adabe]], [[Habu language|Habu]], [[Kairui-Midiki]], [[Maku'a language|Maku'a]], [[Naueti language|Naueti]], and [[Waima'a language|Waima'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Portuguese School of Díli, Timor-Leste.jpg|thumb|[[Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti]], the Portuguese School of Díli.]]

The [[Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste|National University of East Timor]] is the country's main university. There are also four colleges.&lt;ref name=robinson /&gt;

Since independence, both [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and Tetum have lost ground as [[Medium of instruction|mediums of instruction]], while [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has increased: in 2001 only 8.4% of primary school and 6.8% of secondary school students attended a Portuguese-medium school; by 2005 this had increased to 81.6% for primary and 46.3% for secondary schools.&lt;ref name=edulang&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 5.7 - Profile Of Students That Attended The 2004/05 Academic Year By Rural And Urban Areas And By District |url=http://dne.mof.gov.tl/TLSLS/StatisticalData/5_Education/Main%20Tables/table5.7.htm |publisher=Direcção Nacional de Estatística}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian formerly played a considerable role in education, being used by 73.7% of all secondary school students as a medium of instruction, but by 2005 it was used by most schools only in [[Baucau District|Baucau]], [[Manatuto District|Manatuto]], as well as the capital district.&lt;ref name=edulang/&gt;

The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for East Timor is 370. This is compared with 928.6 in 2008 and 1016.3 in 1990. The under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 births is 60 and the neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/country_info/profile/en_TimorLeste_SoWMy_Profile.pdf |title=Timor-Leste |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |date=|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 8 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 44.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOWMY&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html |title=The State Of The World's Midwifery |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, due to a [[Cuba]]n–East Timorese training programme initiated in 2003, East Timor will have more doctors [[per capita]] than any other country in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cuban infusion remains the lifeblood of Timor-Leste's health service |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/25/cuba-lifeblood-timor-leste-health-service |publisher=guardian.co.uk |location=London |first=Kate |last=Hodal |date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in East Timor}}
[[Image:Motael Church, Dili, East Timor (312012049).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Church of [[Motael Church|São António de Motael]], Dili]]
According to the 2010 census, 96.9% of the population profess [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]; 2.2% [[Protestantism]] or [[Evangelicalism]]; 0.3% are [[Islam|Muslim]]; and 0.5% practise some other or no religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Volume 2: Population Distribution by Administrative Areas |url=http://www.mof.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Publication-2-English-Web.pdf |work=Population and Housing Census of Timor-Leste, 2010 |publisher=Timor-Leste Ministry of Finance |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994,&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Robinson, G. ''If you leave us here, we will die'', Princeton University Press 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; with Church membership having grown considerably under Indonesian rule as ''[[Pancasila Indonesia|Pancasila]]'', Indonesia's state ideology, requires all citizens to [[monotheism|believe in one God]] and does not recognise traditional beliefs. In rural areas, Catholicism is practised along with local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hajek |first1=John |last2=Tilman |first2=Alexandre Vital |title=East Timor Phrasebook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHyLpvoZeaMC&amp;pg=PA56 |date=1 October 2001 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74059-020-4 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Constitution of East Timor]] enshrines the principles of [[freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] in Section 45 Comma 1, it also acknowledges &quot;the participation of the Catholic Church in the process of national liberation&quot; in its preamble but, however, it has no legal value.&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution Of The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste |url=http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf |publisher=Governo de Timor-Leste}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon independence, the country joined the [[Philippines]] to become the only two predominantly Roman Catholic states in Asia, although nearby parts of eastern Indonesia such as [[West Timor]] and [[Flores]] also have Catholic majorities.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] divides East Timor into [[List of Roman Catholic dioceses in East Timor|three dioceses]]: the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Díli|Diocese of Díli]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baucau|Diocese of Baucau]], and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Maliana|Diocese of Maliana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pope Benedict XVI erects new diocese in East Timor |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope_benedict_xvi_erects_new_diocese_in_east_timor/ |publisher=Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of East Timor}}
[[File:Lospalos klein.jpg|thumb|upright|Sacred house (''lee teinu'') in [[Lospalos]]]]

The culture of East Timor reflects numerous influences, including Portuguese, Roman Catholic and Indonesian, on Timor's [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] and [[Melanesia]]n cultures. East Timorese culture is heavily influenced by Austronesian legends. For example, East Timorese [[creation myth]] has it that an aging [[crocodile]] transformed into the island of Timor as part of a debt repayment to a young boy who had helped the crocodile when it was sick.&lt;ref name=wiseamanda&gt;{{citation |last1=Wise |first1=Amanda |title=Exile and Return Among the East Timorese |place=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=211–218 |year=2006 |isbn=0-8122-3909-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the island is shaped like a crocodile and the boy's descendants are the native East Timorese who inhabit it. The phrase &quot;leaving the crocodile&quot; refers to the pained exile of East Timorese from their island.

===Arts===
There is also a strong tradition{{clarify|date=July 2013}} of poetry in the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, for example, is a distinguished poet.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Architecturally, Portuguese-style buildings can be found, along with the traditional totem houses of the eastern region. These are known as ''[[uma lulik]]'' (&quot;sacred houses&quot;) in Tetum and ''lee teinu'' (&quot;legged houses&quot;) in Fataluku.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Craftsmanship and the weaving of traditional scarves (''tais'') is also widespread.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

An extensive collection of Timorese audiovisual material is held at the [[National Film and Sound Archive|National Film and Sound Archive of Australia]]. These holdings have been identified in a document titled The NFSA Timor-Leste Collection Profile, which features catalogue entries and essays for a total of 795 NFSA-held moving image, recorded sound and documentation works that have captured the history and culture of East Timor since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfsa.gov.au/about/media/releases/2012/12/14/nfsa-provides-insight-timor-leste-history/ NFSA provides insight into Timor-Leste history] on ''nfsa.gov.au''&lt;/ref&gt; The NFSA is working with the East Timor government to ensure that all of this material can be used and accessed by the people of that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nfsa.gov.au/blog/2013/04/24/connection-timor-leste/ A connection with Timor-Leste] on ''nfsa.gov.au''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the first East Timorese feature film, ''[[Beatriz's War]]'', was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/fresh-start-for-east-timors-film-scene-20131002-2urxt.html |title=Fresh start for East Timor's film scene |accessdate=3 October 2013 |work=Sydney Morning Hearld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
The [[cuisine of East Timor]] consists of regional popular foods such as pork, fish, basil, [[tamarind]], legumes, corn, [[rice]], root vegetables, and tropical fruit. East Timorese cuisine has influences from [[Southeast Asia]]n foods and from [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese dishes]] from its colonisation by Portugal. Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the centuries-old Portuguese presence on the island.

===Sports===
Sports organisations joined by East Timor include the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), the International Badminton Federation (IBF), joined the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]], the International Weightlifting Federation, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), and [[East Timor national football team|East Timor's national football team]] joined [[FIFA]]. East Timorese athletes competed in the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games]] held 2003. In the 2003 ASEAN [[Paralympics]] Games, East Timor won a bronze medal. In the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004 Olympic Games]], East Timorese athletes participated in athletics, weightlifting and boxing. East Timor [[Timor Leste at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games|won three medals]] in [[Arnis at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games]]. East Timor competed in the [[2006 Lusophony Games|first]] [[Lusophony Games]] and, in October 2008, the country earned its first international points in a [[FIFA]] football match with a 2–2 draw against Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Madra |first=Ek |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/10/30/soccer-asia-timor-idUKLNE49T08T20081030 |title=World's worst football team happy to win first point |publisher=Reuters |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Timor competed at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

[[Thomas Americo]] was the first East Timorese fighter to fight for a world [[boxing]] title. He was murdered in 1999, shortly before Indonesian occupation of East Timor ended.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Thomas_Americo&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally called the '''Country of Curaçao''', ({{lang-nl|Land Curaçao}};&lt;ref&gt;Formal name according to [http://www.curacao-gov.an/images/strukturafiles/Staatsregeling_18-6-10.pdf Art. 1 para 1 Constitution of Curaçao] (Dutch version)&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pap|Pais Kòrsou}}),&lt;ref&gt;Formal name according to [http://www.curacao-gov.an/images/strukturafiles/konstitushon/Konstitushon_Papiamentu.pdf Art. 1 para 1 Constitution of Curaçao] (Papiamentu version)&lt;/ref&gt; it includes the main island and the uninhabited island of [[Klein Curaçao]] (&quot;Little Curaçao&quot;). It has a [[population]] of over 150,000 on an area of {{convert|444|km2|abbr=on}} and its capital is [[Willemstad]].

Before the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] on 10 October 2010, Curaçao was administered as the &quot;Island Territory of Curaçao&quot;&lt;ref&gt;English name used by the Government of Curaçao and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles (English was an official language of the Netherlands Antilles and the Island Territory of Curaçao)&lt;/ref&gt; (Dutch: ''Eilandgebied Curaçao'', Papiamentu: ''Teritorio Insular di Kòrsou''), one of five [[List of islands of the Netherlands Antilles|island territories]] of the former Netherlands Antilles.

==Etymology==
[[File:1562 Americae-Gutierrez map 10hrs-inn Sth-Florida-Cuba-Spagnola-Benezuela-to-Lesser-Antilles.jpg|thumb|left|Map from 1562 with Curaçao indicated as Qúracao.]]
According to Edgard Otero, author of &quot;Origins of countries' names&quot;, the island was discovered by Spaniards, who left in the island members of their crew who had become ill during the trip. When the ships returned to the island one year later, expecting to find the sick already dead, they found their old crew members healthy and healed. For that reason, the island was baptized as &quot;Isla de la Curación&quot; (Island of the Cure, or Island of Healing). In 1520 the island would figure for the first time in a map - which was nonetheless designed by the Portuguese, in whose language the island was called &quot;Ilha da Curação&quot; (Curação still means healing in Portuguese).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Another theory for the origin of the name of the island Curaçao is that it is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for ''heart'' (''coração''), referring to the island as a centre in trade. [[Spain|Spanish]] traders kept the name as ''Curazao'', which was followed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A third possible explanation is that Curaçao derives from a similar-sounding name that the [[Arawak people]]  had used to identify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Joubert and Van Buurt, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

On a map created by [[Hieronymus Cock]] in 1562 in [[Antwerp]], the island was referred to as Qúracao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd3/g3290/g3290/ct000342.jp2&amp;style=dsxpmap&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/gmd:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(g3290+ct000342))+@field(COLLID+dsxpmap))&amp;title=Americae%20sive%20qvartae%20orbis%20partis%20nova%20et%20exactissima%20descriptio%20%2f%20avtore%20Diego%20Gvtiero%20Philippi%20Regis%20Hisp.%20etc.%20Cosmographo%20;%20Hiero.%20Cock%20excvde%201562%20;%20Hieronymus%20Cock%20excude%20cum%20gratia%20et%20priuilegio%201562. Cock's 1562 map] at the Library of Congress website&lt;/ref&gt;

Four British [[Royal Navy]] ships have been named after the Island between 1809 and 1942. All have used the unusual spelling, [[HMS Curacoa]]. The last of these was a [[HMS Curacoa (D41)|C-class light cruiser of 1917]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The name &quot;Curaçao&quot; has become associated with a shade of blue, because of the deep-blue version of the [[liqueur]] named [[Curaçao liqueur|Curaçao]] (also known as &quot;blue Curaçao&quot;).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==History==
{{main|History of Curaçao}}
[[File:Curaçao1836.png|thumb|Map of Curaçao in 1836]]
The original inhabitants of Curaçao were [[Arawak peoples]]. Their ancestors had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, likely hundreds of years before Europeans arrived.

The first Europeans recorded as seeing the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Arawak as their labour force. They sometimes forcibly relocated the survivors to other colonies where workers were needed. In 1634, after the Netherlands achieved independence from Spain, Dutch colonists started to occupy the island. European powers were trying to get bases in the Caribbean.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] founded the capital of [[Willemstad]] on the banks of an inlet called the 'Schottegat'. Curaçao had been ignored by colonists, because it lacked gold deposits. The [[natural harbour]] of Willemstad proved to be an ideal spot for trade. Commerce and shipping&amp;nbsp;— and [[piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]]—became Curaçao's most important economic activities. In addition, in 1662 the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao a centre for the [[Atlantic slave trade]], often bringing slaves here for sale elsewhere in the Caribbean.

[[Sephardic Jews]] settled here with the Dutch and in then-[[Dutch Brazil]]; they have had a significant influence on the culture and economy of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;&quot;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Curacao.html Curaçao]&quot;. Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Some merchants were part of the Dutch colonial slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' |date=February 13, 1994 |title=Jews and the Slave Trade |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-02-13/news/1994044079_1_atlantic-slave-slave-trade-jews/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Franco-Dutch War]], Count&lt;!--&quot;Admiral&quot; might be more appropriate here--&gt; [[Jean II d'Estrées]] planned to attack Curaçao. His fleet&amp;nbsp;— 12 men of war, three fireships, two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers&amp;nbsp;— met with disaster, losing seven men of war and two other ships when they struck reefs off the [[Las Aves archipelago]]. They had made a serious navigational error, hitting the reefs on 11 May 1678, a week after setting sail from [[Saint Kitts]]. Curaçao marked the events by a day of thanksgiving, celebrated for decades into the 18th century, to commemorate the island's escape from being invaded by the French.

Although a few [[plantations]] were established on the island by the Dutch, the first profitable industry established on Curaçao was [[salt mines|salt mining]]. The mineral was a lucrative export at the time and was a major factor for the island being part of international commerce.

[[File:Willemstad harbor.jpg|thumb|Dutch architecture along [[Willemstad]]'s harbour]]
Many Dutch colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, and the city built impressive colonial buildings. Curaçao architecture blends Dutch and Spanish colonial styles. The wide range of historic buildings in and around Willemstad has resulted in the capital being designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Landhouses (former plantation estates) and West African style ''kas di pal'i maishi'' (former slave dwellings) are scattered all over the island. Some have been restored and can be visited.

In 1795, a major [[Curaçao Slave Revolt of 1795|slave revolt]] took place under the leaders [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula Rigaud]], Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and Pedro Wakao. Up to 4000 slaves on the northwest section of the island revolted. Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights. After a month, the slave owners suppressed the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papiamentu.net/curacao/heroes.html |title=Curaçao History |publisher=Papiamentu.net |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curaçao's proximity to [[South America]] resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas. For instance, architectural similarities can be seen between the 19th-century parts of [[Willemstad]] and the nearby Venezuelan city of [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] in [[Falcón State]]. The latter has also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the 19th century, Curaçaoans such as [[Manuel Piar]] and [[Luis Brión]] were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and [[Colombia]]. Political refugees from the mainland (such as [[Simon Bolivar]]) regrouped in Curaçao. Children from affluent Venezuelan families were educated on the island.

[[File:Luis Brión 2012 000.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Brión]], a Curaçao-born [[Venezuela]]n admiral]]
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the island changed hands among the British, the French, and the Dutch several times. In the early 19th century, Portuguese and Lebanese migrated to Curaçao attracted by the business opportunities. Stable Dutch rule returned in 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], when the island was incorporated into the colony of [[Curaçao and Dependencies]].

The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, bringing a change in the economy with the shift to wage labour. Some inhabitants of Curaçao emigrated to other islands, such as [[Cuba]], to work in [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar cane plantations]]. Other former slaves had nowhere to go and remained working for the plantation owner in the [[tenant farmer]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Called &quot;Paga Tera&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This was an instituted order in which the former slave leased land from his former master. In exchange the tenant promised to give up most of his harvest to the former slave master. This system lasted until the beginning of the 20th century.

Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Putte&gt;''Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd''. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers&lt;/ref&gt; Students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish up until the late 19th century. There were also efforts to introduce bilingual popular education in Dutch and Papiamentu in the late 19th century (van Putte 1999).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Royal Dutch Shell Curaçao.jpg]] --&gt;
When in 1914, oil was discovered in the [[Maracaibo Basin]] town of [[Mene Grande]], the fortunes of the island were dramatically altered.

In 1915, the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (Shell) and the Dutch government decided to establish  an extensive oil refinery installation on the former site of the slave-trade market at Asiento. The oil company suddenly had many jobs for the local population and attracted a wave of immigration from surrounding nations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}The installation became operational three years later. There were a number of geographic and political advantages to establishing a refinery on an island off the Venezuelan coast: the predicted market growth in the US, the politically troubled Mexican oil production and the expected increase of traffic through the [[Panama Canal]]. A natural deepwater harbour and a stable political climate made Curaçao the obvious choice. Shell has been the largest employer on the island since 1918. Of the 44,344 inhabitants in 1929, 10,924 worked for the oil industry. This number peaked in 1952, with 12,631 employees.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The refinery was an important source of fuel for allied forces in the World War II. Economically, the refinery has been the mainstay of Curaçao since 1915: it generates currency necessary for vital imports and is thus crucial to the future economic development of the island. The refinery’s success is also its weak point. If this sector is threatened, the consequences for Curaçao would be immediate and significant.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the years before and after [[World War II]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] emigrated from Eastern Europe, many of whom were [[Romanian Jews]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the early years, both Shell and [[Exxon]] held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to the refineries in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. The integrated companies Shell and Exxon controlled the entire industry from pumping, transporting and refining to marketing the end product. The refineries on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because the of margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues realized on products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries. The nationalization of the oil industry in Venezuela in 1975 was a setback.
The companies had to buy oil on the international markets at higher prices. As the Shell refinery on Curaçao was best equipped to process the Venezuelan heavy crude, the company was subject to Venezuelan oil politics when it came to price and supply. Coupled with high operating costs, these difficulties were the reasons the refinery on Curaçao continually operated at a loss.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell's refinery on Curaçao operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global over-production, tougher competition and low market expectations threatened the future of the Shell refinery in Curaçao. In 1985, after a presence of 70 years, Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Curaçao. Shell's announcement came at a crucial moment; the fragile economy of Curaçao had been stagnating for some time. Several revenue generating endeavours suffered even more during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation of the bolivar, the transport industry deteriorated with deleterious effects on the profits of the Antillean Airline Company and the Curaçao Dry Dock Company experienced major setbacks. The offshore industry (financial services) also experienced a downturn because of radical new tax laws in the US. Significant intervention in the public sector was required to reduce budget deficits. The future did not look promising: a macro-economic study predicted economic stagnation for several years even if Shell stayed and other industries experienced growth. It was more likely that the gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink by 20 percent, unemployment would rise to 35 percent and emigration would increase. It was clear that closure had to be avoided because the consequences could be disastrous.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao was an ideal site for the refinery, as it was away from the social and civil unrest of the South American mainland, but near enough to the Maracaibo Basin oil fields. It had an excellent natural harbour that could accommodate large oil tankers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

East and South Asian immigrants arrived during the economic boom of the early 20th century. Shell brought affluence to the island. Large scale housing was provided and Willemstad developed an extensive infrastructure. However, inequality among the social groups of Curaçao led to discontent and the antagonisms between Curaçao social groups and culminated in [[1969 Curaçao uprising|rioting and protest on 30 May 1969]]. The civil unrest launched a [[social movement]] that resulted in the local Afro-Caribbean population attaining more influence over the political process (Anderson and Dynes 1975).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

in the early 20th century, Dutch was made the sole language of instruction in the educational system to facilitate schooling for the children of [[expatriate]] employees of Royal Dutch Shell (Romer, 1999). [[Papiamentu]], the local [[Creole language]], was tentatively reintroduced in the school curriculum during the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao gained self-government on 1 January 1954, as an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles. The islanders did not fully participate in the political process until after the social movements of the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The island has developed a tourist industry and offered low corporate taxes to encourage companies to set up holdings in order to avoid higher taxes elsewhere. It has emphasized its diverse heritage to expand its tourism industry.  Since the late 20th century, immigrants have come from neighbouring countries, such as Venezuela, but also from the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], and the [[Anglophone Caribbean]] and Colombia. In the early 21st century, a number of Dutch [[pension]]ers (''pensionados'') have settled on the island for its mild climate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the mid-1980s, Shell sold the refinery for the symbolic amount of one [[Netherlands Antillean guilder|Antillean guilder]] to a local government consortium. The aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits in recent years, which charge that its emissions, including [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], far exceed safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-06-30 |title=Curaçao refinery sputters on, despite emissions |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN2929170620080701|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government consortium currently leases the refinery to the Venezuelan state oil company [[PDVSA]].

On 2 July 1984, the 30th anniversary of the first elected Island Council, the council inaugurated the national flag and the official anthem. In the 2000s, the political relationship with the other islands of the Netherlands Antilles, and with the Netherlands, came under discussion again. In a referendum held on 8 April 2005, the residents voted for separate status outside the Netherlands Antilles, similar to [[Aruba]]. They rejected the options for full independence, becoming part of the Netherlands, or retaining the status quo.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Due to an economic slump in the late 1990s and early 2000s, emigration to the Netherlands has been high.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wodc.nl/images/ob299-summary_tcm44-402600.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2007, the island of Curaçao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 28 November 2006, this was delayed when the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;approved&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=The Daily Herald St. Maarten |title=Curaçao IC ratifies 2 November accord |url=http://www.thedailyherald.com/news/daily/k045/ratify045.html |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711181904/http://www.thedailyherald.com/news/daily/k045/ratify045.html |archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2008, Curaçao was scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles were). A non-binding referendum on this plan took place in Curaçao on 15 May 2009, in which 52 percent of the voters supported these plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d98729g80/curacao-referendum-approves-increasing-autonomy.html |title=Curaçao referendum approves increasing autonomy |publisher=Newser |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] came into effect on 10 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2009/10/1/011009_antillen.html |title=NOS Nieuws&amp;nbsp;– Antillen opgeheven op 10-10-2010 |publisher=Nos.nl |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curaçao became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. The kingdom was also to oversee the island's finances under a debt-relief arrangement agreed between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11511355 |work=BBC News |title=Status change means Dutch Antilles no longer exists |date=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curaçao's first [[Prime Minister of Curaçao|prime minister]] was [[Gerrit Schotte]].

Political debate has centered on the issue of Papiamentu becoming the sole language of instruction. Proponents argue that it will help preserve the language and will improve the quality of primary and secondary school education. Proponents of Dutch-language instruction argue that students who study in Dutch will be better prepared for the university education offered to Curaçao residents in the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Forts===
When the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, and pirates. Six of the best preserved forts can still be seen today:

* Waterfort (1634)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curacao.com/The-Curacao-Difference/Vibrant-Architecture/Forts |title=Waterfort |publisher=Curacao.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Piscadera Bay Fort]] (built between 1701–1704)

In 1957, the Hotel Van der Valk Plaza Curaçao was built on top of the Waterfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8tD8_FRoW8C&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;ots=etQ7sz51r6&amp;dq=waterfort%20vander%20valk%20hotel%20constructie&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=waterfort%20vander%20valk%20hotel%20constructie&amp;f=false |title=On top of the Waterfort |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Riffort contains restaurants, and shops. It is located on the opposite side of the Waterfort across the entrance to the harbour. In 2009, the Renaissance Curaçao Resort and Casino opened next to the Riffort.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) GEA Curaçao. Ref.

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Curacao-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|350px|Map of Curaçao]]

Curaçao, as well as the rest of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] and also [[Trinidad and Tobago]], lies on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Curaçao's highest point is the Sint Christoffelberg {{convert|375|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The coastlines bays, inlets and hot springs offer an on-site source of natural mineral, thermal or seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, making this island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region.

===Flora===
The flora of Curaçao differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. [[Xeric]] [[scrubland]]s are common, with various forms of [[cacti]], thorny shrubs, [[evergreen]]s, and the island's national tree, [[divi-divi]]s.

===Fauna===
{{further|Rodents of the Caribbean#Curaçao}}

===Climate===
Curaçao has a [[tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''As'') with a [[dry season]] from January to September and a [[wet season]] from October to December.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteoan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.an/Climate_Sum.asp |title=Climate Summaries |publisher=Meteorological Department Curaçao |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures are relatively constant with small differences throughout the year. The [[trade winds]] bring cooling during the day and the same trade winds bring warming during the night. The coolest month is January with an average temperature of {{convert|26.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest month is September with an average temperature of {{convert|28.9|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The year's average maximum temperature is {{convert|31.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The year's average minimum temperature is {{convert|25.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Curaçao lies outside the [[hurricane belt]], but is still occasionally affected by hurricanes, as for example [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] in 1954, [[Hurricane Anna (1961)|Anna]] in 1961 [[Hurricane Felix (2007)|Felix]] in 2007 and [[Hurricane Omar (2008)|Omar]] in 2008. A [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] of a [[hurricane]] in Curaçao has not occurred since the [[United States]] [[National Hurricane Center]] started tracking hurricanes. Curaçao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical storms several times; the latest which did so were [[Hurricane Tomas|Tomas]] in 2010, [[Hurricane Cesar-Douglas|Cesar]] in 1996, [[Hurricane Joan-Miriam|Joan-Miriam]] in 1988, [[Hurricane Cora|Cora]] and [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Greta]] in 1978, [[Hurricane Edith (1971)|Edith]] and [[Hurricane Irene (1971)|Irene]] in 1971 and [[Hurricane Francelia|Francelia]] in 1969. Tomas brushed Curaçao as a tropical storm, dropping as much as {{convert|265|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation on the territory, nearly half of the annual precipitation in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doden door noodweer op Curaçao|url=http://www.nu.nl/buitenland/2369389/doden-noodweer-curaao.html|accessdate=1 November 2010|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Netherlands National News Agency|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the island's history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myheadlines.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=MyHeadlines&amp;file=index5&amp;sid=1558&amp;cid=3586951&amp;source=Nieuws.nl|title=Damdoorbraken in Curaçao door storm Tomas|accessdate=2 November 2010|date=2 November 2010|publisher=Nieuws.nl|author=Staff Writer|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NAƒ60&amp;nbsp;million (US$28&amp;nbsp;million) in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curalive.com/news/versgeperst/06nov2010-50-miljoen-schade|title=50 miljoen schade|date=6 November 2010|publisher=versgeperst.com|author=Elisa Koek|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/caribiana/article/twee-doden-op-curacao-door-tropische-storm-tomas|title=Twee doden op Curaçao door Tropische Storm Tomas|author=Redactie Aworaki|date=2 November 2010|publisher=Aworaki.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
The northern sea floor drops steeply within {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} of the shore. This drop-off is known as the &quot;blue edge&quot;.

On Curaçao, four major geological formations can be found: The lava formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Curaçao formation and Limestone formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/ecosystems/geology|title=CARMABI Research Station Curacao|work=researchstationcarmabi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|right|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]
{{main|Government of Curaçao}}

The government of Curaçao takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[country]]. The [[Prime Minister of Curaçao|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament.

The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Convicted felons are held at the [[Sentro di Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou|Curaçao Centre for Detention and Correction]] prison.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Curaçao has full autonomy on most matters, with the exceptions summed up in the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] under the title &quot;[[Kingdom of the Netherlands#Kingdom affairs|Kingdom affairs]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Military==
Two [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch]] naval bases, [[Parera]] and [[Suffisant]], are located on the island of Curaçao.
Officers of the [[Military of Aruba|Arubaanse Militie]] complete further training on Curaçao.

===Conscription===
Suffisant Naval Base has facilities for conscription in the Caribbean, which has not been military conscription since 1997, but social conscription. This type of conscription offers underprivileged Antillean young people the chance of taking professional training.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.defensie.nl/english/organisation/navy/contents/navy-units/dutch-naval-command-caribbean] Commander Netherlands Forces in the Caribbean&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Curaçao}}

Curaçao has an [[open economy]], with tourism, international trade, shipping services, refining, storage (oil and bunkering) and international financial services being the most important sectors. Curaçao's economy is well developed and supports a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] and 27th in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|nominal GDP per capita]]. Curaçao possesses a [[World Bank high-income economy|high income economy]], as defined by the World Bank. Activities related to the port of Willemstad (like the [[Free Trade Zone]]) make a significant contribution to the economy. To achieve the government's aim to make its economy more diverse, efforts are being made to attract more foreign investment. This policy, called the 'Open Arms' policy, features a heavy focus on information technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curacao-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Investors%20Guide%20Curacao%202006.pdf |title=1609_1_DEZ_Manual_binnenw.qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mindmagnet.com |url=http://www.ecommerceatcuracao.com/corporate.htm |title=Ecommerce at Curaçao Corporate |publisher=Ecommerceatcuracao.com |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investcuracao.com/01e01.html |title=Economic Data Overview |publisher=Investcuracao.com |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---need very good cites for comparing country to &quot;other&quot; (unnamed) neighbors.

===Tourism===
{{update|section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:View elevator Fort.JPG|thumb|right|View of Piscadera Fort and Bay]]
While tourism plays a major role in Curaçao's economy, it is less reliant on tourism than other Caribbean countries. Most tourists originate from the Eastern United States, South America and the Netherlands. It currently leads the Caribbean in cruise tourism growth with 610,186 cruise passengers in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the prior year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaribbeanInTourismGrowth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Caribbean Journal staff |url=http://www.caribjournal.com/2014/02/14/curacao-leading-caribbean-in-cruise-tourism-growth/|title=Curaçao Leading Caribbean in Cruise Tourism Growth |publisher=Caribjournal.com |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hato International Airport]] received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and recently announced capital investments totaling US$48 million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional hub by 2018.

Beginning in early 2015, the [[Lynx rocketplane]] is expected to be flying suborbital [[space tourism]] flights and scientific research missions from a new [[spaceport]] on Curaçao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff writers |title=Space Experience Curaçao Announces Wet Lease of XCOR Lynx Suborbital |work=Space Media Network Promotions |publisher=Space-Travel.com   |date=October 6, 2010 |url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Space_Experience_Curaçao_Announces_Wet_Lease_of_XCOR_Lynx_Suborbital_999.html  |accessdate=2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Space Experience Curaçao |work=Home |publisher=Space Experience Curaçao  |date=2009–2010 |url=http://spaceexperiencecuracao.com/ |accessdate=2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's [[Continental shelf|insular shelf]] has a sharp drop-off known as the &quot;Blue Edge.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Scuba diving]] tourists often visit for this vista.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Coral reefs for [[snorkeling]] and scuba diving can be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. The coastline of Curaçao features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations for boats.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. [[Playa Porto Marie|Porto Marie Beach]] is experimenting with artificial coral reefs in order to improve the reef's condition.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish.

[[File:Curacao-Sea-Aquarium-2013.JPG|thumb|The Curaçao Sea Aquarium and the Dolphin Academy share this islet on the west coast of Curaçao, with [[Seaquarium Beach]] nearby.]]

===Labour===
In 2013, the unemployment rate was 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curacaochronicle.com/local/unemployment-rose-to-13-0-percent|title=Unemployment rose to 13.0 percent|work=Curaçao Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial services===
Curaçao's history in [[financial services]] dates back to [[World War I]]. Prior to this period, the financial arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. However, at the turn of the century, Curaçao underwent industrialization, and a number of merchant houses established private [[commercial bank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.caribseek.com/Curacao/Commercial_History_of_Curacao/twentieth-century-private-banking.shtml |title=Twentieth Century Private Banking&amp;nbsp;— Roots Of Our Future |publisher=caribseek.com |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually becoming full-fledged financial institutions.

The [[Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange]] is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the [[Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten]]; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the oldest [[central bank]] in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralbank.an/index.php?eid=1948 |title=In 175 years the Bank has evolved from a near dormant institution in the nineteenth century to a vibrant organization able to adapt to the ever changing financial world in the twenty-first century |publisher=centralbank.an |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's legal system supports a variety of corporate structures and is a [[corporate haven]]. Though Curaçao is considered a [[tax haven]], it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status from the [[United States Internal Revenue Service]]. It is an accepted jurisdiction of the [[OECD]] and Caribbean [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]]. The country enforces Anti-[[Money Laundering]] and [[Counter-Terrorism]] funding compliance.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Trade===
Curaçao trades mainly with the United States, Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Curaçao to export products to European markets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070624215811/http://www.curacao-chamber.an/c-info-htm/content/EUTradeProgram.htm EU Trade Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; free of import duties and quotas. It is also a participant in the US [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Development/Preference_Programs/CBI/Section_Index.html |title=USTR&amp;nbsp;– Caribbean Basin Initiative |publisher=Ustr.gov |date=2000-10-01 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
[[Prostitution]] in Curaçao is legal. A large open-air brothel called &quot;[[Le Mirage (brothel)|Le Mirage]]&quot; or &quot;Campo Alegre&quot; has operated near the airport since the 1940s. Curaçao monitors, contains and regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global-writes.com/2009/08/curacaos-x-rated-resort.html|title=Curaçao's X-Rated Resort|year=2009|publisher=Global Writes|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that,&quot;Curaçao...[is a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trafficking192&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm |title=Trafficking in Persons Report |accessdate=|author=|authorlink=|date=4 June 2008 |work=|publisher=U.S. State Dept. |page=192 |archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State has said that the government of Curaçao frequently underestimates the extent of [[human trafficking]] problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;trafficking192&quot;/&gt;

===Languages===
Curaçao is a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] society. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Papiamentu]], and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official-languages&quot;/&gt; However, Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/about-us/the-dutch-caribbean |title=About Us |website=DutchCaribbeanLegalPortal.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Curaçao's population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, a [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese creole]] spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced as a language of [[primary school]] education in 1993, making Curaçao one of a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire basic literacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddicoat2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Liddicoat|title=Language planning and policy: issues in language planning and literacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aP3iylRYWywC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=15 June 2007|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-977-4|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spanish and English also have a long historical presence in Curaçao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia.&lt;ref name=Putte/&gt; Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao and [[Bonaire]]. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted wide use of the language.&lt;ref name=Putte/&gt;

According to the 2001 census, Papiamentu is the [[first language]] of 81.2% of the population. Dutch is the first language of 8% of the population. Spanish is the first language of 4% of the population, and English is the first language of 2.9%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.cw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=103:households-by-the-most-spoken-language-in-the-household&amp;catid=48:household-characteristics&amp;Itemid=82 |title=Households by the most spoken language in the household Population and Housing Census 2001 |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these numbers divide the population in terms of first language and do not account for the high rate of [[bilingualism]] in the population of Curaçao.

===Ethnicities===
&lt;!---this needs to be &quot;what is&quot;, not what was or why it is--&gt;
[[File:bulawaya-1.jpg|thumb|A Bulawaya dance]]
Because of its history, the island's population comes from a number of ethnic backgrounds. There is an [[Afro-Caribbean]] majority of African descent, and also sizeable minorities of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], Latin American, [[French people|French]], [[South Asia]]n, [[East Asia]]n, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Levant]]ine people. Additionally, there are both [[Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi]] Jews.

===Religion===

According to a 2011 estimate, the majority of the inhabitants of Curaçao: Roman Catholic 72.8%, Pentecostal 6.6%, Protestant 3.2%, Adventist 3%, Jehovah's Witness 2%, Evangelical 1.9%, other 3.8%, none 6%, unspecified 0.6%.&lt;ref name=CIAWF /&gt;

This includes a shift towards the charismatic renewal or charismatic movement since the mid-1970s. Other denominations include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[Methodist Church]]. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practice [[Montamentu]] and other diaspora African religions.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Like elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also practising Muslims and Hindus.

While small, Curaçao's [[Judaism|Jewish]] community has had a significant impact on the island's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the [[Americas]], dating to 1651. The [[Curaçao synagogue]] is the oldest [[synagogue]] of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue.

==Education==

Public education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues six years, secondary lasts for another five.&lt;ref name=&quot;edu&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw5W8m87FpkC&amp;lpg=PA593&amp;dq=Cura%C3%A7ao%20education&amp;pg=PA593#v=onepage&amp;q=had%20671%20students%20in%201996&amp;f=false |title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003&amp;nbsp;– Page 593 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main institute of higher learning is the [[University of Curaçao]], enrolling 2,100 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;edu&quot;/&gt; The comprehensive model of education is under influences from both Dutch and American's education offering. Other higher education offering on the island include [[Offshore Medical School in the Caribbean|offshore medical schools]], language schools and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosalind Latiner |first=Raby |authorlink=|title=Community College Models: Globalization and Higher Education Reform |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzyx5mwzGGcC&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepag|accessdate=7 May 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |location=|isbn=978-1-4020-9477-4|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Literature===
Despite the island's relatively small population, the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Curaçao have generated a remarkable literary tradition, primarily in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Papiamentu]]. The oral traditions of the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] [[indigenous peoples]] are lost. West African slaves brought the tales of [[Anansi]], thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by [[Joseph Sickman Corsen]] entitled ''Atardi'', published in the ''La Cruz'' newspaper in 1905. Throughout Curaçaoan literature, [[narrative]] techniques and metaphors best characterized as [[magic realism]] tend to predominate.  Novelists and poets from Curaçao have made an impressive contribution to [[Caribbean Literature|Caribbean]] and [[Dutch literature]].  Best known are [[Cola Debrot]], [[Frank Martinus Arion]], Pierre Lauffer, Elis Juliana,Guillermo Rosario, Boeli van Leeuwen and [[Tip Marugg]].

===Cuisine===
Local food is called ''Krioyo'' (pronounced the same as ''criollo'', the Spanish word for &quot;Creole&quot;) and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. Dishes common in Curaçao are found in [[Aruba]] and [[Bonaire]] as well. Popular dishes include: stobá (a stew made with various ingredients such as [[papaya]], [[beef]] or [[goat]]), Guiambo (soup made from [[okra]] and [[seafood]]), kadushi (cactus soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to [[fufu]], [[ugali]] and [[polenta]]) and a lot of fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous side dish is fried [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. Local bread rolls are made according to a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] recipe. All around the island, there are snèk's which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English [[public house]].

The ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings of cheese, tuna, ham, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed, such as the [[hallaca]] and pekelé, made out of [[salt cod]]. At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: kokada (coconut sweets), ko'i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and tentalaria (peanut sweets). The [[Curaçao liqueur]] was developed here, when a local experimented with the rinds of the local [[citrus]] fruit known as [[laraha]]. [[Suriname]]se, Chinese, [[Indonesia]]n, Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as [[satay]], [[nasi goreng]] and [[lumpia]] (which are all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as [[croquette]]s and [[oliebollen]] are widely served in homes and restaurants.

[[File:Jurickson Profar (9260642222).jpg|thumb|[[Jurickson Profar]]]]
In 2004, the [[Little League Baseball]] team from Willemstad, Curaçao, won the world title in a game against the [[United States]] champion from [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. The Willemstad lineup included [[Jurickson Profar]], the standout shortstop prospect who now plays for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] of [[Major League Baseball]].

In the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], Curaçaoans played for the Netherlands team. [[Shairon Martis]], born in [[Willemstad]], contributed to the Dutch team by throwing a seven-inning no-hitter against Panama (the game was stopped due to the [[mercy rule]]).

The 2010 documentary film, Boys of Summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boysofsummerfilm.com/ |title=Boys of Summer |publisher=Boysofsummerfilm.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; details Curaçao's Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country's eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport.

The prevailing trade winds and warm water make Curaçao a location for windsurfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windsurfingcuracao.com/ |title=Curaçao's Caribbean sister islands, Aruba and Bonaire, are well known in the windsurfing world. Curaçao, which receives the same Caribbean trade winds as its siblings, has remained undiscovered by traveling windsurfers |publisher=Windsurfingcuracao.com |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motion Magazine, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One factor is that the deep water around Curaçao makes it difficult to lay marks for major windsurfing events, thus hindering the island's success as a windsurfing destination.

There is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers and snorkelers may have visibility up to 30&amp;nbsp;m (98&amp;nbsp;ft) at the Curaçao Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} of Curaçao's southern coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times |title=Frommers Guide to Curaçao water sports |url=http://www.nytimes.com/frommers/travel/guides/caribbean-and-bermuda/curacao/frm_curacao_0178020606.html |date=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curaçao participated in the [[2013 CARIFTA Games]]. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a distance of 7.36m. Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 female 1500m with a time of 4:47.97.&lt;ref name=cfpi_1&gt;

Ivory Coast's political capital is [[Yamoussoukro]], and its economic capital and largest city is the port city of [[Abidjan]].

Prior to its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including [[Gyaaman]], the [[Kong Empire]], and [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]]. Two [[Anyi people|Anyi]] kingdoms, ''Indénié'' and ''[[Kingdom of Sanwi|Sanwi]]'', attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0013) |title=Pre-European Period|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory Coast became a protectorate of France in 1843–44 and was later formed into a French colony in 1893 amid the European [[scramble for Africa]]. Ivory Coast achieved independence in 1960, led by [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], who ruled the country until 1993. It maintained close political and economic association with its West African neighbors while at the same time maintaining close ties to the West, [[Françafrique|especially France]]. Since the end of Houphouët-Boigny's rule in 1993, Ivory Coast has experienced one ''[[coup d'état]]'', in 1999, and two religion-grounded civil wars. The first took place [[First Ivorian Civil War|between 2002 and 2007]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Loi n° 2000-513 du 1er août 2000 portant Constitution de la République de Côte d'Ivoire|url=http://www.jfaconseil.com/jorci/2000/RCI%20JO%202000-30.pdf|journal=Journal Officiel de la République de Côte d'Ivoire|volume=42|pages=529–538|date=3 August 2000|accessdate=7 August 2008|issue=30|language=fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325153412/http://www.jfaconseil.com/jorci/2000/RCI%20JO%202000-30.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second [[Second Ivorian Civil War|during 2010-2011]].

Ivory Coast is a republic with a strong executive power invested in its [[President of Ivory Coast|president]]. Through the production of coffee and [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], the country was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s. Ivory Coast went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period of political and social turmoil. The 21st-century Ivorian economy is largely market-based and still relies heavily on agriculture, with [[Smallholding|smallholder]] cash-crop production being dominant.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

The [[official language]] is [[French language|French]], with local indigenous languages also widely used, including [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Dioula language|Dioula]], [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Anyin language|Anyin]], and [[Senari languages|Cebaara Senufo]]. The main religions are Islam, Christianity (primarily [[Roman Catholicism in Ivory Coast|Roman Catholicism]]), and various [[indigenous religion]]s.

==Names==
Portuguese and French merchant-explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries divided the west coast of Africa, very roughly, into five &quot;coasts&quot; reflecting local economies. The coast that the French named the ''Côte d'Ivoire'' and the Portuguese named the ''Costa do Marfim''—both, literally, being &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;—lay between what was known as the ''Guiné de Cabo Verde'', so-called &quot;Upper Guinea&quot; at [[Cap-Vert|Cabo Verde]], and Lower Guinea.{{sfn|Thornton|1996|p=53–56}}{{sfn|Lipski|2005|p=39}} There was also a &quot;[[Grain Coast]]&quot;, a &quot;[[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]&quot;, and a &quot;[[Slave Coast]]&quot;. Like those three, the name &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; reflected the major trade that occurred on that particular stretch of the coast, the export of ivory.{{sfn|Duckett|1853|p=594}}{{sfn|Thornton|1996|p=53–56}}{{sfn|Homans|1858|p=14}}{{sfn|Lipsky|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Plée|1868|p=146}}

Other names for the coast of ivory included the ''Côte de Dents'',{{refn|[[Joseph Vaissète]], in his 1755 ''Géographie historique, ecclésiastique et civile'', lists the name as ''La Côte des Dents'' (&quot;The Coast of the Teeth&quot;), but notes that ''Côte de Dents'' is the more correct form.{{sfn|Vaissète|1755|p=185–186}}|group=n|name=teeths}} literally &quot;Teeth Coast&quot;, again reflecting the trade in ivory;{{sfn|Blanchard|1818|p=57}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=100}}{{sfn|Duckett|1853|p=594}}{{sfn|Lipski|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Plée|1868|p=146}}{{sfn|Walckenaer|1827|p=35}} the ''Côte de Quaqua'', after the people whom the Dutch named the Quaqua (alternatively Kwa Kwa);{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=100}}{{sfn|Thornton|1996|p=53–56}}{{sfn|Vaissète|1755|p=185–186}} the Coast of the Five and Six Stripes, after a type of cotton fabric also traded there;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=100}} and the ''Côte du Vent''{{refn|''Côte du Vent'' sometimes denoted the combined &quot;Ivory&quot; and &quot;Grain&quot; coasts, or sometimes just the &quot;Grain&quot; coast.{{sfn|Duckett|1853|p=594}}{{sfn|Thornton|1996|p=53–56}}|group=n|name=vent}}, the Windward Coast, after perennial local off-shore weather conditions.{{sfn|Duckett|1853|p=594}}{{sfn|Thornton|1996|p=53–56}} One can find the name ''Cote de(s) Dents'' regularly used in older works.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=100}} It was used in Duckett's ''Dictionnaire'' {{harv|Duckett|1853}} and by Nicolas Villault de Bellefond, for examples, although [[Antoine François Prévost]] used ''Côte d'Ivoire''.{{sfn|Walckenaer|1827|p=35}} In the 19th century, it died out in favor of ''Côte d'Ivoire''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=100}}

The coastline of the modern state is not quite coterminous with what the 15th- and 16th-century merchants knew as the &quot;Teeth&quot; or &quot;Ivory&quot; coast, which was considered to stretch from [[Cape Palmas]] to [[Cape Three Points]] and which is thus now divided between the modern states of Ghana and Ivory Coast (with a minute portion of Liberia).{{sfn|Blanchard|1818|p=57}}{{sfn|Homans|1858|p=14}}{{sfn|Walckenaer|1827|p=35}}{{sfn|Vaissète|1755|p=185–186}} It retained the name through French rule, though, and independence in 1960.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ivory Coast|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/643|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name had long since been translated literally into other languages,{{refn|Literal translations include ''Elfenbeinküste'' (German), ''Costa d'Avorio'' (Italian), ''Norsunluuraniko'' (Finnish), Бе́рег Слоно́вой Ко́сти (Russian), and of course Ivory Coast.{{sfn|David|2000|p=7}}|group=n|name=trans}} which the postindependence government considered to be increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the Francophone sphere. Therefore, in April 1986, the government declared Côte d'Ivoire (or, more fully, République de Côte d'Ivoire{{sfn|Auzias|Labourdette|2008|p=9}}) to be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol, and officially refuses to recognize or accept any translation from French to another language in its international dealings.{{sfn|David|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Lea|Rowe|2001|p=127}}{{sfn|Jessup|1998|p=351}}

Despite the Ivorian government's request, the English translation &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; (often &quot;''the'' Ivory Coast&quot;) is still frequently used in English, by various media outlets and publications.{{refn|The [[BBC]] usually uses &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; both in news reports and on its page about the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1043014.stm |work=BBC News |title=Country profile: Ivory Coast |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's style guide says: &quot;Ivory Coast, not 'The Ivory Coast' or 'Côte d'Ivoire'; its nationals are Ivorians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guardian Style Guide: I |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 December 2008 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/i |accessdate=30 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ivory Coast}}

===Land migration===
[[File:Cistones.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric polished stone [[celt (tool)|celt]] from [[Boundiali]] in northern Ivory Coast, photo taken at the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]] in [[Dakar]], Senegal]]

The first human presence in Ivory Coast has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country's humid climate. However, the presence of newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through [[shale]] and remnants of cooking and fishing) has been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (15,000 to 10,000 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guédé|first=François Yiodé|title=Contribution à l'étude du paléolithique de la Côte d'Ivoire : État des connaissances|year=1995|journal=Journal des Africanistes|volume=65|issue=2|pages=79–91|doi=10.3406/jafr.1995.2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the minimum, the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rougerie|1978|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known inhabitants of Ivory Coast have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants, who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé ([[Aboisso]]), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri ([[Grand Lahou]]), Ega and Diès ([[Divo, Ivory Coast|Divo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kipré|1992|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods===
The first recorded history is found in the chronicles of North African ([[Berber people|Berber]]) traders, who, from early [[Roman times]], conducted a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] trade across the [[Sahara]] in salt, [[slaves]], gold, and other goods. The southern terminals of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the [[rain forest]]. The more important terminals—[[Djenné]], [[Gao]], and [[Timbuctu]]—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.

By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states. The Sudanic empires also became centres of [[Islamic studies|Islamic education]]. Islam had been introduced in the western Sudan (today's Mali) by Muslim Berber traders from North Africa; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. From the 11th century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.

The [[Ghana empire]], the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in present-day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the 13th centuries. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu. After the decline of Ghana, the [[Mali Empire]] grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the north-west corner around [[Odienné]].

Its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]], flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare. This discord spurred most of the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt. The dense rain forest, covering the southern half of the country, created barriers to the large-scale political organizations that had arisen in the north. Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders. Villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting.

===Pre-European era===
[[File:Royaumes ci.jpg|thumb|350px|Pre-European kingdoms]]
Five important states flourished in Ivory Coast in the pre-European era. The Muslim [[Kong Empire]] was established by the [[Juula]] in the early 18th century in the north-central region inhabited by the [[Sénoufo]], who had fled [[Islamization]] under the [[Mali Empire]]. Although Kong became a prosperous center of agriculture, trade, and crafts, ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom. The city of Kong was destroyed in 1895 by [[Samori Ture]].

The [[Abron tribe|Abron]] kingdom of [[Gyaaman]] was established in the 17th century by an [[Akan people|Akan]] group, the Abron, who had fled the developing [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] [[confederation]] of [[Asanteman]] in what is present-day Ghana. From their settlement south of [[Bondoukou]], the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the [[Dyula people]] in Bondoukou, who were recent ''émigrés'' from the market city of [[Begho]]. Bondoukou developed into a major center of commerce and Islam. The kingdom's [[Quran]]ic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. In the mid-17th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Asante established a [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] kingdom at [[Sakasso]] and two [[Anyi people|Agni]] kingdoms, Indénié and [[Sanwi]].

The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers. It finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast's independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress&quot;/&gt; The current king of Sanwi is Nana Amon Ndoufou V (since 2002).

===Establishment of French rule===
Compared to neighboring Ghana, Ivory Coast suffered little from the [[slave trade]], as European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbors. The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the Portuguese in 1482. The first West African French settlement, [[Saint Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]], was founded in the mid-17th century in Senegal, while at about the same time, the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at [[Gorée|Goree Island]], off Dakar. A French [[missionary|mission]] was established in 1637 [[Assinie]] near the border with the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana).

Assinie's survival was precarious, however; the French were not firmly established in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. In 1843–4, French admiral [[Louis Edouard Bouët-Willaumez|Bouët-Willaumez]] signed treaties with the kings of the [[Grand Bassam]] and Assinie regions, making their territories a French [[protectorate]]. French [[Exploration|explorers]], [[missionaries]], trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.

Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the [[Senegal River|Senegal]] and the [[Niger River|Niger]]. Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century, but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African rulers that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres.
[[File:Aouabou-Traité-1892.jpg|thumb|[[Louis-Gustave Binger]] of French West Africa in 1892 treaty signing with [[Famienkro]] leaders, in present-day N'zi-Comoé Region, Ivory Coast]]
The first posts in Ivory Coast included one at Assinie and another at Grand Bassam, which became the colony's first capital. The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts, and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or ''[[coutume]]s'' paid annually to the local rulers for the use of the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade.

France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast. The French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior. (They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] forces, mostly from Gambia. [[Guerrilla warfare]] by the Baoulé and other eastern groups continued until 1917).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its French West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand Bassam in Ivory Coast was left in the care of a shipper from [[Marseille]], [[Arthur Verdier]], who in 1878 was named [[Resident (title)|Resident]] of the Establishment of Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0014) |title=Ivory Coast – Arrival of the Europeans|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior. In 1887, Lieutenant [[Louis Gustave Binger]] began a two-year journey that traversed parts of Ivory Coast's interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in Ivory Coast. Also in 1887, Verdier's agent, [[Marcel Treich-Laplène]], negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.

===French colonial era===
[[File:Arrivée à Kong-1892.jpg|thumb|Arrival in [[Kong, Côte d'Ivoire|Kong]] of new French West Africa governor Louis-Gustave Binger in 1892.]]
By the end of the 1880s, France had established what passed for control over the coastal regions of Ivory Coast, and in 1889 Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Laplène titular governor of the territory. In 1893, Ivory Coast was made a French colony, and then Captain Binger was appointed governor. Agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the French government to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day [[Burkina Faso]]) and [[French Sudan]] (present-day Mali) to Ivory Coast for economic and administrative reasons.

France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, the French and British were largely bureaucrats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana [[plantation]]s and adopted a forced-labour system.

Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts. Some of the native population resisted French penetration and settlement. Among those offering greatest resistance was [[Samori Ture]], who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the [[Wassoulou Empire]], which extended over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. Samori Ture's large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own [[firearm]]s, attracted strong support throughout the region. The French responded to Samori Ture's expansion of regional control with military pressure. French campaigns against Samori Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898.

France's imposition of a [[tax per head|head tax]] in 1900 to support the colony in a [[public works]] program provoked a number of revolts. Many Ivoirians viewed the tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties because they thought that France was demanding the equivalent of a ''[[coutume]]'' from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Many of the population, especially in the interior, considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0016) |title=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, the French officially abolished [[African slave trade|slavery]] in most of French West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf Slave Emancipation and the Expansion of Islam, 1905–1914]&quot;. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Almamy Samory Touré.jpg|thumb|Samori Touré]]
From 1904 to 1958, Ivory Coast was a constituent unit of the [[Federation of French West Africa]]. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. In World War I, Ivory Coast was put into a bad position with German invasion threatened in 1914. After that, however, France made regiments from Ivory Coast to fight in France, and colony resources were rationed from 1917-1919. Some 150,000 men from Ivory Coast died in World War I. Until the period following [[World War II]], governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France's policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of &quot;association&quot;, meaning that all Africans in Ivory Coast were officially French &quot;subjects&quot;, but without rights to representation in Africa or France.

[[French colonial empires#Second French colonial empire|French colonial policy]] incorporated concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and association. Based on an assumption of the superiority of [[French culture]] over all others, in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of French language, institutions, laws, and customs to the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests.

An indigenous [[elite]] trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans. Assimilation was practiced in Ivory Coast to the extent that after 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivoirians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship. Most Ivoirians, however, were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0018) |title=Ivory Coast – FRENCH RULE UNTIL WORLD WAR II: Evolution of Colonial Policy|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; As subjects of France, they had no political rights. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the ''[[indigénat]]'', a separate system of law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0019) |title=Ivory Coast – Colonial Administration|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, the [[Vichy regime]] remained in control until 1942, when British troops invaded without much resistance. Winston Churchill gave power back to members of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s provisional government. By 1943, the Allies had returned French West Africa to the French. The [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]], the first Constituent Assembly of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946, and France's gratitude for African loyalty during World War II, led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African &quot;subjects&quot;, the right to organize politically was recognized, and various forms of forced labor were abolished.

Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralized administration that left little room for Ivoirian participation in policy making. Whereas British colonial administration adopted divide-and-rule policies elsewhere, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite, the French were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the ''status quo'' to refrain from any anti-French sentiment. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivoirians believed that they would achieve equality with their French peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France. After the assimilation doctrine was implemented entirely through the postwar reforms, though, Ivoirian leaders realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivoirians, and that discrimination and political inequality would end only with independence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0017) |title=Ivory Coast – Repression and Conquest|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
[[File:Houphouet-Boigny Kennedy.jpg|thumb|Félix Houphouët-Boigny in the [[White House]] [[Entrance Hall]] with President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962]]
The son of a Baoulé chief, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], was to become Ivory Coast's father of independence. In 1944, he formed the country's first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later, the French abolished forced labour. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that the country would benefit from it, which it did for many years. France appointed him as the first African to become a minister in a European government.

A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act (''[[Loi Cadre]]''), which transferred a number of powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in [[French West Africa]] and also removed remaining voting inequalities. In 1958, Ivory Coast became an autonomous member of the French Community (which replaced the [[French Union]]).

At the time of Ivory Coast's independence (1960), the country was easily French West Africa's most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production. This was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting Ivory Coast into third place in world output (behind Brazil and Colombia). By 1979, the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa.

It also became Africa's leading exporter of [[pineapples]] and [[palm oil]]. French technicians contributed to the &quot;Ivoirian miracle&quot;. In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence, but in Ivory Coast, they poured in. The French community grew from only 30,000 prior to independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers, and advisors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/ivory-coast/41.htm Ivory Coast&amp;nbsp;– The Economy], ''U.S. Library of Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa's non-oil-exporting countries.

===Houphouët-Boigny administration===
Houphouët-Boigny's one-party rule was not amenable to political competition. [[Laurent Gbagbo]], who became the president of Ivory Coast in 2000, had to flee, as he incurred the ire of Houphouët-Boigny when Gbagbo founded the [[Ivoirian Popular Front|Front Populaire Ivoirien]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, Mike (2011) ''Making War in Côte d'Ivoire'', The University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0226514609. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Houphouët-Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population who continually elected him. He was also criticized for his emphasis on developing large-scale projects.

Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, [[Yamoussoukro]], into the new political capital were wasted; others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace, education, and religion in the heart of the country. In the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivoirian economy. Due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices, the country's external debt increased three-fold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption. The unrest forced the government to support multiparty democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble, and died in 1993. He favoured [[Henri Konan Bédié]] as his successor.

===Bédié administration===
In October 1995, Bédié overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt.
[[File:Coted'Ivoire Elections2002.png|thumb|Election results of 2002 in Ivory Coast]]
Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasized the concept of &quot;Ivority&quot; (''[[Ivoirité]]'') to exclude his rival [[Alassane Ouattara]], who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivoirian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivoirian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, which resulted in two civil wars in the following decades.

===1999 coup===
Similarly, Bedié excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|''coup'']], putting General [[Robert Guéï]] in power. Bedié fled into exile in France. The new leadership reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

===Gbagbo administration===
A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with Guéï, but it was peaceful. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, Guéï was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. [[Alassane Ouattara]] was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court, due to his alleged Burkinabé nationality. The existing and later reformed constitution [under Guéï] did not allow noncitizens to run for the presidency. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country's north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

===Ivorian Civil War===
{{Main|First Ivorian Civil War}}

[[File:Armed insurgents, First Ivorian Civil War.jpg|thumb|300px|A technical in the [[First Ivorian Civil War]], 2002–2007]]
In the early hours of 19 September 2002, while the President was in Italy, an armed uprising occurred. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime, the government forces had secured the main city, Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and the rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of [[Bouaké]].

The rebels threatened to move on Abidjan again, and France deployed troops from its base in the country to stop any rebel advance. The French said they were protecting their own citizens from danger, but their deployment also aided the government forces. That the French were helping either side was not established as a fact, but each side accused them of being on the opposite side. Whether the French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed.

What exactly happened that night is disputed. The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï had led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the German embassy; his home had burned down.

President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking the residents.

An early ceasefire with the rebels, which had the backing of much of the northern populace, proved short-lived, and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kepi.cncplusplus.com/Ivory_Coast/Ivory_Coast.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510015255/http://www.kepi.cncplusplus.com/Ivory_Coast/Ivory_Coast.htm |archivedate=10 May 2011 |title=Ivory Coast&amp;nbsp;– Heart of Darkness |publisher=Kepi.cncplusplus.com |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and militias, including warlords and fighters from Liberia and Sierra Leone, took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

====2002 Unity Government====
[[File:059 French Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|300px|Armed Ivorians next to a [[French Foreign Legion]] armoured tank, 2004]]

In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a &quot;government of national unity&quot;. Curfews were lifted, and French troops patrolled the western border of the country. The unity government was unstable, and the central problems remained, with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed in an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to foreign nationals being evacuated. A later report concluded the killings were planned.

Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a &quot;Zone of Confidence&quot;, relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed following the rebels' refusal to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During [[2004 French–Ivorian clashes|one of these airstrikes]] in [[Bouaké]], on 6 November 2004, French soldiers were hit, and nine were killed; the Ivorian government has said it was a mistake, but the French have claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivoirian military aircraft (two Su-25 planes and five helicopters), and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan.&lt;ref&gt;Holguin, Jaime (15 November 2004) {{Wayback |date=20131008165150 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/15/opinion/fenton/main655762.shtml |title=&quot;France's 'Little Iraq'&quot;}}. CBS News.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gbagbo's original mandate as president expired on 30 October 2005, but due to the lack of disarmament,  holding an election was deemed impossible, so his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year, according to a plan worked out by the [[African Union]]; this plan was endorsed by the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=56730 &quot;UN endorses plan to leave president in office beyond mandate&quot;], IRIN, 14 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; With the late-October deadline approaching in 2006, the election was regarded as very unlikely to be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo.&lt;ref&gt;Bavier, Joe (18 August 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070312061303rn_1/www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-08/2006-08-18-voa13.cfm?CFID=121056525&amp;CFTOKEN=68059362 &quot;Ivory Coast Opposition, Rebels Say No to Term Extension for President&quot;], VOA News.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo's term on 1 November 2006; however, the resolution provided for the strengthening of Prime Minister [[Charles Konan Banny]]'s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61473 &quot;Partial rejection of UN peace plan&quot;], IRIN, 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peace accord between the government and the rebels, or [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|New Forces]], was signed on 4 March 2007, and subsequently [[Guillaume Soro]], leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. These events have been seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo's position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026105514/http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=nw20070412095335190C984275 &quot;New Ivory Coast govt 'a boost for Gbagbo'&quot;], AFP via int.iol.co.za, 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presidential elections that should have been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results announced independently by the president of the Electoral Commission from the headquarters of Allasane due to controversies about fraud in that commission, consisting in majority and presided by Allasane supporters, showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of his rival, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.&lt;ref name=Thousands26&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12079552|accessdate=26 December 2010|publisher=BBC News |title=Thousands flee Ivory Coast for Liberia amid poll crisis|date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council, charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire]]. These charges were contradicted by United Nations' observers (differently from Africa Union Observers). The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consists of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote - instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission.&lt;ref name=Thousands26 /&gt;

After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara—who was recognized as the winner by most countries and the United Nations—organized an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees fled the country.&lt;ref name=Thousands26 /&gt;

The [[African Union]] sent [[Thabo Mbeki]], former President of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted a common resolution recognising Alassane Ouattara as winner of the elections, based on the position of the [[Economic Community of West African States]], which suspended Ivory Coast from all its decision-making bodies&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ecowas.int/presseshow.php?nb=188&amp;lang=en&amp;annee=2010 &quot;Final Communique on the Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government on Cote D’Ivoire&quot;], Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), 7 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while the African Union also suspended the country's membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/2010/december/Communiqu%C3%A9%20of%20the%20252nd.pdf &quot;Communique of the 252nd Meeting of the Peace and Security Council&quot;], African Union, 9 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a colonel of the Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao, was arrested in New York in a year-long [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] operation charging for procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions of 4,000 [[9 mm]] handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 tear-gas grenades, in violation of a UN embargo. Several other Ivory Coast officers were released on their diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/09/21/FBI-nabbed-colonel-on-official-business/UPI-16431285082800/ &quot;FBI nabbed colonel on official business&quot;], UPI, 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ivory Coast}}

Ivory Coast is a country of western [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. It borders [[Liberia]] and [[Guinea]] in the west, [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] in the north, [[Ghana]] in the east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Atlantic Ocean) in the south. The country lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[2nd meridian west|2°]] and [[9th meridian west|9°W]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Ivory Coast|Districts of Ivory Coast|Regions of Ivory Coast|Departments of Ivory Coast|Sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast}}
Since 2011, Ivory Coast has been administratively organised into 12 [[districts of Ivory Coast|districts]] plus two district-level autonomous cities. The districts are divided into 31 [[Regions of Ivory Coast|regions]]; the regions are divided into 105 [[departments of Ivory Coast|departments]]; and the departments are divided into 510 [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]].&lt;ref&gt;''Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes'' (GENC) second edition&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, multiple villages are organised into [[Communes of Ivory Coast|communes]]. The autonomous districts are not divided into regions or departments, but they do contain sub-prefectures and communes.

Since 1983, Ivory Coast's capital has been Yamoussoukro. Abidjan is the administrative center. Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan. The Ivoirian population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war. International human-rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive noncombatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production.

Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with the north controlled by the New Forces. A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005, and an agreement was reached among the rival parties in March 2007 to proceed with this, but it continued to be postponed until November 2010 due to delays in its preparation.

Elections were finally held in 2010. The first round of elections was held peacefully, and widely hailed as free and fair. Runoffs were held 28 November 2010, after being delayed one week from the original date of 21 November. Laurent Gbagbo as president ran against former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/10/ivory.coast.runoff/ |title=Ivory Coast postpones presidential runoff vote |author=Agnero, Eric |date=10 November 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December, the Electoral Commission declared that Ouattara had won the election by a margin of 54% to 46%. In response, the Gbagbo-aligned Constitutional Council rejected the declaration, and the government announced that country's borders had been sealed. An Ivorian military spokesman said, &quot;The air, land, and sea border of the country are closed to all movement of people and goods.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11905971|title=Ivory Coast election: Army says it has sealed borders |date=3 December 2010 |work=BBC |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Ivory Coast}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Cote d'Ivoire.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Ivory Coast's exports]]
Ivory Coast has, for the region, a relatively high income per capita (US$1014.4 in 2013) and plays a key role in transit trade for neighboring, landlocked countries. The country is the largest economy in the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]], constituting 40% of the monetary union’s total GDP. The country is the world's largest exporter of [[cocoa bean]]s, and the fourth-largest exporter of goods, in general, in sub-Saharan Africa (following South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cote-d-ivoire/cote-d-ivoire-financial-sector-profile.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022073819/http://www.mfw4a.org/cote-d-ivoire/cote-d-ivoire-financial-sector-profile.html |archivedate=22 October 2010 |title=Côte d'Ivoire: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=MFW4A.org |accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the cocoa-bean farmers earned $2.53 billion for cocoa exports and were expected to produce 630,000 metric tons in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101224/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=132047606 |title=Ivory Coast Makes 1st Cocoa Export Since January |publisher=Associated Press via NPR |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monnier |first=Olivier |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-27/ivory-coast-san-pedro-port-sees-cocoa-exports-stagnating.html |title=Ivory Coast San Pedro Port Sees Cocoa Exports Stagnating |publisher=Bloomberg |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[the Hershey Company]], the price of cocoa beans is expected to rise dramatically in upcoming years.&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, Brad (23 September 2013), [http://business.time.com/2013/09/23/time-to-get-ready-for-a-smaller-hershey-bar &quot;Time to Get Ready for a Smaller Hershey Bar?&quot;] Business.time.com.

The maintenance of close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labor force, inasmuch as instances of indentured labor have been reported in the cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor'' since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/cote_divoire.htm 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Côte d'Ivoire]; the United States Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Yassapoulet.JPG|thumb|[[Yassa (food)|''Yassa'']] is a popular dish throughout West Africa prepared with chicken or fish. Chicken yassa is pictured.]]
{{Main|Ivorian cuisine}}

The traditional cuisine of Ivory Coast is very similar to that of neighboring countries in West Africa in its reliance on grains and [[tuber]]s. Cassava and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A type of corn paste called ''aitiu'' is used to prepare corn balls, and [[peanut]]s are widely used in many dishes. ''[[Attiéké]]'' is a popular side dish in Ivory Coast made with grated [[cassava]] and is a vegetable-based [[couscous]]. A common [[street food]] is ''[[aloko]]'', which is ripe banana fried in [[palm oil]], spiced with steamed onions and chili and eaten alone or with grilled fish. Chicken is commonly consumed and has a unique flavor due to its lean, low-fat mass in this region. Seafood includes [[tuna]], [[sardine]]s, [[shrimp]], and [[bonito]], which is similar to tuna. ''Mafé'' is a common dish consisting of meat in a [[peanut sauce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eats&quot;&gt;[http://www.whats4eats.com/africa/ivory-coast-cuisine &quot;Ivory Coast, Côte d'Ivoire: Cuisine and Recipes.&quot;] [http://www.whats4eats.com Whats4eats.com]. Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow-simmered [[stew]]s with various ingredients are another common food staple in Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;eats&quot;/&gt; ''[[Kedjenou]]'' is a dish consisting of chicken and vegetables that are slow-cooked in a sealed pot with little or no added liquid, which concentrates the flavors of the chicken and vegetables and tenderizes the chicken.&lt;ref name=&quot;eats&quot;/&gt; It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a canary, over a slight fire, or cooked in an oven.&lt;ref name=&quot;eats&quot;/&gt; ''Bangui'' is a local palm wine.

Ivorians have a particular kind of small, open-air restaurant called a ''maquis'', which is unique to the region. A ''maquis'' normally features braised chicken and fish covered in onions and tomatoes, served with ''attiéké'' or ''kedjenou''.

'''Georgia'''  ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Georgia.ogg|ˈ|dʒ|ɔr|dʒ|ə}}; {{lang-ka|საქართველო}}, [[Romanization of Georgian|tr.]] ''Sakartvelo'', {{IPA-ka|sɑkʰɑrtʰvɛlɔ|IPA|Sakartvelo.ogg}}) is a country in [[Eurasia]], located on [[Boundaries between continents|the crossroads]] of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Asia#Definition_and_boundaries|West Asia]]. Nestled between the [[Greater Caucasus]] and [[Lesser Caucasus]] [[mountain range|mountain ranges]], it is bounded to the west by the [[Black Sea]], to the north and northeast by [[Russia]], to the south by [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]], and to the southeast by [[Azerbaijan]]. The [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|largest city]] is [[Tbilisi]]. Georgia covers a territory of {{convert|69700|km²|0|abbr=out}}, and its 2015 population is about 3.75&amp;nbsp;million. Georgia is a [[unitary state|unitary]], [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic, with the government elected through a [[representative democracy]].

During [[classical antiquity]], several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia. The kingdoms of [[Colchis]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] adopted Christianity as their state religion in the early 4th century, leading to the decline and elimination of previously dominant [[paganism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Mithraism]]. A unified [[Kingdom of Georgia]] reached the [[Georgian Golden Age|peak of its political and economic strength]] during the reign of [[David IV of Georgia|King David IV]] and [[Queen Tamar]] from the late 11th to the early 13th centuries. Thereafter and throughout the [[early modern period]] Georgia became fractured and fell into decline due to the onslaught of various hostile empires, including the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and successive dynasties of [[Iran]]. In 1783, the eastern Georgian kingdom of [[Kartli-Kakheti]] forged an [[Treaty of Georgievsk|ill-fated alliance]] with the [[Russian Empire]], which led to the gradual [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|annexation]] of Georgia by Russia starting in 1801. After a brief [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|period of independence]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the first Georgian Republic was [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|occupied]] by [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] in 1921, and absorbed into the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1922. After restoring its independence in 1991, [[Post-Communism|post-communist]] Georgia suffered from a [[Georgian Civil War|civil unrest]] and economic crisis for most of the 1990s. After a peaceful change of power in the [[Rose Revolution]] of 2003, Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of political and economic reforms.

Georgia is a member of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]]. It contains two ''de facto'' independent regions, [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], which gained [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|limited international recognition]] after the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]]. Georgia and a major part of the international community consider the regions to be part of [[Occupied territories of Georgia|Georgia's sovereign territory under Russian military occupation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf |title=The Law of Georgia on Occupied Territories (431-IIs)|date=23 October 2008|publisher=[[State Ministry for Reintegration (Georgia)|State Ministry for Reintegration]]|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
{{Main|Name of Georgia}}
[[File:St. George Tbilisi Georgia L.Verdzeuli.jpg|thumb|left|It is said that ''[[Georgians]]'' were so named because they revered [[Saint George]].]]

A definitive origin of European ''Georgia'' has never been established, but there are a number of unconfirmed theories as to its provenance. [[Jacques de Vitry]] and Franz Ferdinand von Troilo have explained the name's origin by the popularity of [[St. George]] ([[Tetri Giorgi]]) among Georgians. &lt;ref&gt;[[Grigol Peradze|Peradze, Gregory]]. &quot;The Pilgrims' derivation of the name Georgia&quot;. ''Georgica'', Autumn, 1937, nos. 4 &amp; 5, 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, popularized by the likes of [[Jean Chardin]], semantically linked &quot;Georgia&quot; to Greek γεωργός (&quot;tiller of the land&quot;). The supporters of this explanation sometimes referred to classical authors, in particular [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] and [[Pomponius Mela]], who mentioned agricultural tribes called &quot;Georgi&quot;, (Pliny, IV.26, VI.14; Mela, ''De Sita Orb''. i.2, &amp;50; ii.1, &amp; 44, 102.) so named to distinguish them from their unsettled and pastoral neighbors on the other side of the river [[Panticapaeum|Panticapea]].&lt;ref&gt;Romer, Frank E.  (ed., 1998), ''Pomponius Mela's Description of the World'', p. 72. [[University of Michigan Press]], ISBN 0-472-08452-6&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, several modern scholars have theorized that &quot;Georgia&quot; could have been borrowed in the 11th or 12th centuries from the [[New Persian]] ''gurğ''/''gurğān''. &lt;ref&gt;Khintibidze, Elguja, ''The Designations of the Georgians and Their Etymology'', pp. 29-30. [[Tbilisi State University]] Press, 1998, ISBN 5-511-00775-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The native name is ''Sakartvelo'' ([[wikt:საქართველო|საქართველო]]; &quot;land of Kartvelians&quot;), derived from the core central Georgian region of [[Kartli]], recorded from the 9th century, and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval [[Kingdom of Georgia]] by the 13th century. The self-designation used by [[Georgians|ethnic Georgians]] is ''Kartvelebi'' (ქართველები, i.e. &quot;[[Kartvelian peoples|Kartvelians]]&quot;)
The medieval [[the Georgian Chronicles|Georgian Chronicles]] present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, [[Kartlos]], a great-grandson of [[Japheth]]. The name ''Sakartvelo'' (საქართველო) consists of two parts.

The territory of modern-day Georgia was inhabited by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' since the [[Paleolithic Era]].

[[File:State Museum of History of Georgia (Tbilisi Archaeological Museum) 5.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Patera|phiale]] depicting [[Antinous]] unearthed near modern-day [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgian National Museum]]]]

The [[classical antiquity|classical period]] saw the rise of the early Georgian states [[Diauehi]] (13th century BC), [[Colchis]] (8th century BC), [[Sper (Georgia)|Sper]] (7th century BC) and Iberia (6th century BC).
In the 4th century BC, a unified kingdom of Georgia – an early example of advanced state organization under one king and an aristocratic hierarchy – was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints|publisher=[[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St. Vladimir's Seminary Press]]|edition=2|year=1997|author=[[David Marshall Lang]]|ISBN=978-0913836293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], Colchis was the location of the [[Golden Fleece]] sought by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Apollonius Rhodius]]' epic tale ''[[Argonautica]]''. The incorporation of the Golden Fleece into the myth may have derived from the local practice of using fleeces to sift gold dust from rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOCge15&quot;&gt;&quot;Christianity and the Georgian Empire&quot; (early history) Library of Congress, March 1994, webpage:[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ge0015) LCweb2-ge0015].&lt;/ref&gt; Known to its natives as [[Egrisi]] or Lazica, Colchis was also the battlefield of the [[Lazic War]] fought between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]].

===Middle Ages up to Early Modern Period===
[[File:Tamar (Vardzia fresco detail).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] presided over the [[Georgian Golden Age]] and was titled &quot;King&quot; due to her position as the first woman to rule Georgia in her own right.{{sfn|Eastmond|p=109}}]]

The early kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions by the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for [[Arab conquests|Arabs to conquer]] most of [[Arab rule in Georgia|eastern Georgia]] in the 7th century. From the 7th century to the 10th century,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Georgia was part of the [[Khazars|Khazar empire]].

The various independent regions would not be united into a single Kingdom of Georgia until the beginning of the 11th century.

Although [[Arabs]] captured the capital city of Tbilisi in 645 AD, Kartli-Iberia retained considerable independence under local Arab rulers.&lt;ref name=LOCge15/&gt; The prince [[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot I]] (r. 813–830) – also known as Ashot Kurapalat – became the first of the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi family]] to rule the kingdom. Ashot's reign began a period of nearly 1,000 years during which the Bagrationi, as the noble house was known, ruled at least part of what is now the republic. [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] (r. 1027–1072) united western and eastern Georgia.

The [[Kingdom of Georgia]] reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during the reigns of [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] (called David the Builder, r. 1089–1125) and his granddaughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] (r. 1184–1213) has been widely termed as the [[Georgian Golden Age]] or the Georgian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern History of Soviet Georgia |author=[[David Marshall Lang]]|publisher=Greenwood Press|city=London|year=1976|page=29|isbn=978-0837181837}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its Western European analogue, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trust and Conflict: Representation, Culture and Dialogue|editors=Ivana Marková, Alex Gillespie|page=43|series=Cultural Dynamics of Social Representation|year=2011|ISBN=978-0415593465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian Golden Age left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem &quot;[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Georgian Literature and Culture|author1=Howard Aronson|author2=Dodona Kiziria|publisher=Slavica |year=1999|page=119|isbn=978-0893572785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David the Builder initiated the Georgian Golden Age by [[Great Turkish Invasion|driving]] the [[Seljuk Turks]] from the country, winning the major [[Battle of Didgori]] in 1121, and expanding Georgian cultural and political influence southward into Armenia and eastward to the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref name=LOCge15/&gt;

The 29-year reign of Tamar, the first female ruler of Georgia, is considered the most successful in Georgian history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastmond&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia|author=Antony Eastmond|publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010|page=93|ISBN=978-0271016283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamar was given the title &quot;king of kings&quot; (''mepe mepeta'').{{sfn|Eastmond|p=109}} She succeeded in neutralizing opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the downfall of the rival powers of the Seljuks and Byzantium. Supported by a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the Caucasus, and extended over large parts of present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, and eastern Turkey as well as parts of northern Iran,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H.

The revival of the Kingdom of Georgia was set back after Tbilisi was captured and destroyed by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarezmian]] leader [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] in 1226.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rene Grousset, Rene|title='The Empire of the Steppes|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=1991|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols were expelled by [[George V of Georgia]], son of [[Demetrius II of Georgia]], who was named &quot;Brilliant&quot; for his role in restoring the country's previous strength and Christian culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} George V was the last great king of the unified Georgian state. After his death, different local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by several [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|disastrous invasions]] by [[Timur|Tamerlane]]. [[Turkoman invasions of Georgia|Invasions continued]], giving the kingdom no time for restoration, with both [[Kara Koyunlu|Black]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu|White]] sheep Turkomans constantly raiding its southern provinces. As a result, the Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities. Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century up to the early 19th century, [[Safavid Empire|Safavid Iran]] (and successive Iranian [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties) and [[Ottoman Turkey]] subjugated the eastern and western regions of Georgia, respectively.

The rulers of regions that remained partly [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] organized rebellions on various occasions. However, subsequent Iranian and Ottoman invasions further weakened local kingdoms and regions. As a result of incessant wars and deportations, the population of Georgia dwindled to 250,000 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Eastern Georgia]], composed of the regions of [[Kartli]] and [[Kakheti]], had been under Iranian [[suzerainty]] since 1555 following the [[Peace of Amasya]] signed with neighbouring rivalling Ottoman Turkey.

With the death of [[Nader Shah]] in 1747, two major Eastern Georgian kingdoms broke free of Iranian control and were reunified as the [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] under the energetic king [[Erekle II|Heraclius (Erekle) II]] in 1762. He stabilized Eastern Georgia to a degree and was able to guarantee its autonomy throughout the Iranian [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] period.{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|p=328}}

In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian Kingdom of [[Kartli-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], which recognized the bond of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] between the Russian and Georgian people and promised eastern Georgia protection against further Iranian attempts to regain Georgia, or by other aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/georgia.htm |script-title=ru:Георгиевский трактат|trans-title=Treaty of Georgievsk|date=24 July 1783|publisher=[[Moscow State University]]|accessdate=1 February 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyotr Bagration]], one of the descendants of the abolished house of Bagrationi, would later join the Russian army and rise to be a general by the Napoleonic wars.

On 22 December 1800, [[Tsar]] [[Paul I of Russia]], at the alleged request of the Georgian King [[Giorgi XII of Kartli-Kakheti|George XII]], signed the proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was finalized by a decree on 8 January 1801,&lt;ref&gt;Gvosdev (2000), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avalov (1906), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] on 12 September 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Gvosdev (2000), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian envoy in [[Saint Petersburg]] reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor Prince Kurakin.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1801, under the oversight of General {{Ill|ru|Carl Heinrich von Knorring|Кнорринг, Карл Фёдорович}}, Imperial Russia transferred power in eastern Georgia to the government headed by General [[Ivan Petrovich Lazarev]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until, on 12 April 1802, General Knorring assembled the nobility in [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Tbilisi's Sioni Cathedral]] and forced them to take an oath on the [[Imperial Crown of Russia]].

In the summer of 1805, Russian troops on the Askerani River near [[Zagam, Georgia|Zagam]] defeated the Iranian army during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] and saved Tbilisi from reconquest now that it was officially part of the Imperial territories.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918, in the midst of the [[Russian Civil War]]. The [[Menshevik]] Georgian Social-Democratic Party won the parliamentary election. Its leader, [[Noe Zhordania]], became prime minister.

The 1918 [[Georgian–Armenian War]], which erupted over parts of Georgian provinces populated mostly by Armenians, ended because of British intervention. In 1918–1919, Georgian general [[Giorgi Mazniashvili]] led an attack against the White Army led by Moiseev and Denikin in order to claim the [[Black Sea]] coastline from [[Tuapse]] to [[Sochi]] and [[Adlersky City District|Adler]] for independent Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirokov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Широков|first1=И.

In February 1921, Georgia [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|was attacked]] by the Red Army. The Georgian army was defeated and the Social-Democratic government fled the country. On [[Soviet Occupation Day, Georgia|25 February 1921]], the Red Army entered Tbilisi and installed a communist government loyal to Moscow, led by Georgian Bolshevik [[Filipp Makharadze]].

Nevertheless, there remained significant opposition to the Bolsheviks, and this culminated in the [[August Uprising]] of 1924. Soviet rule was firmly established only after this uprising was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Amy. ''Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant'', [[Princeton University Press]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], p. 237, ISBN 978-0-691-01093-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]], which united Georgia, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. Later, in 1936, the TSFSR was disaggregated into its component elements and Georgia became the [[Georgian SSR]].

[[File:Red Army in Tbilisi Feb 25 1921.jpg|thumb|The 11th Red Army of the [[Russian SFSR]] holds a military parade, [[Soviet Occupation Day, Georgia|25 February 1921]] in Tbilisi]]

[[Joseph Stalin]], an ethnic Georgian born Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili (იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი) in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], was prominent among the Bolsheviks. Stalin was to rise to the highest position, leading the Soviet Union from 3 April 1922 until his death on 5 March 1953.

From 1941 to 1945, during World War II, almost 700,000 Georgians fought in the Red Army against [[Nazi Germany]]. There were also a few who [[Georgian Legion (1941-1945)|fought on the German side]]. About 350,000 Georgians died in the battlefields of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/19/AR2009121901006.html Georgia blows up Soviet memorial, two people killed]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&quot;.

On 9 April 1989, a peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi ended with [[April 9 tragedy|several people being killed]] by Soviet troops. Before the October 1990 elections to the national assembly, the ''Umaghlesi Sabcho'' (Supreme Council) – the first polls in the USSR held on a formal multi-party basis – the political landscape was reshaped again. While the more radical groups boycotted the elections and convened an alternative forum (the National Congress) with alleged support of Moscow,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} another part of the anticommunist opposition united into the Round Table—Free Georgia around the former dissidents like [[Merab Kostava]] and [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]]. The latter won the elections by a clear margin, with 155 out of 250 parliamentary seats, whereas the ruling Communist Party (CP) received only 64 seats. All other parties failed to get over the 5 percent threshold and were thus allotted only some single-member constituency seats.

===Georgia after restoration of independence===

On 9 April 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia declared independence. On 26 May 1991, [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia|Gamsakhurdia]] was elected as the first President of independent Georgia. Gamsakhurdia stoked Georgian nationalism and vowed to assert Tbilisi's authority over regions such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia that had been classified as autonomous [[oblast]]s under the Soviet Union.

He was soon deposed in a bloody ''coup d'état'', from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guards and a paramilitary organization called &quot;[[Mkhedrioni]]&quot; (&quot;horsemen&quot;). The country became embroiled in a bitter [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]], which lasted until nearly 1995. [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1985 to 1991) returned to Georgia in 1992 and joined the leaders of the coup — [[Tengiz Kitovani]] and [[Jaba Ioseliani]] — to head a triumvirate called &quot;The State Council&quot;.

Simmering disputes within two regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and [[South Ossetia]], between local separatists and the majority Georgian populations, erupted into widespread inter-ethnic violence and wars. Supported by [[Russia]], Abkhazia, and South Ossetia achieved ''de facto'' independence from Georgia, with Georgia retaining control only in small areas of the disputed territories. In 1995, Shevardnadze was officially elected as president of Georgia.

Roughly 230,000 to 250,000 Georgians&lt;ref name=&quot;hrwreport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Georgia2.htm |title=Georgia/Abchasia: Violations of the laws of war and Russia's role in the conflict |date=March 1995 |publisher=Hrw.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|massacred or expelled]] from Abkhazia by Abkhaz separatists and North Caucasian volunteers (including Chechens) in 1992–1993.

In 2003, Shevardnadze (who won re-election in 2000) was deposed by the [[Rose Revolution]], after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that the November 2 parliamentary elections were marred by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav112204a.shtml |title=EurasiaNet Eurasia Insight – Georgia’s Rose Revolution: Momentum and Consolidation |publisher=Eurasianet.org |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution was led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], [[Zurab Zhvania]] and [[Nino Burjanadze]], former members and leaders of Shevardnadze's ruling party. Mikheil Saakashvili was elected as President of Georgia in 2004.

Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of [[Ajaria]] led to a major [[Ajaria Crisis|crisis]] early in 2004. Success in Ajaria encouraged Saakashvili to intensify his efforts, but without success, in breakaway South Ossetia.

These events, along with accusations of Georgian involvement in the [[Second Chechen War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gorshkov |first=Nikolai |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/2269057.stm |title=Duma prepares for Georgia strike |work=BBC News  |date=September 19, 2002 |accessdate=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a severe deterioration of [[Georgian-Russian relations|relations with Russia]], fuelled also by Russia's open assistance and support to the two secessionist areas.

[[File:Giorgi Margvelashvili, President of Georgia.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=President Giorgi Margvelashvili|[[Giorgi Margvelashvili]], the current president, and thus the [[head of state]] of Georgia]]
Georgia is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[semi-presidential]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Georgia|President]] as the head of state, and Prime Minister as the head of government. The executive branch of power is made up of the President and the [[Cabinet of Georgia]]. The Cabinet is composed of ministers, headed by the [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]], and appointed by the President. Notably, the ministers of defense and interior are not members of the Cabinet and are subordinated directly to the President of Georgia. [[Giorgi Margvelashvili]] is the current President of Georgia after winning 62.12% of the vote in the [[Georgian presidential election, 2013|2013 election]]. Since 2013, [[Irakli Garibashvili]] has been the prime minister of Georgia.

[[Legislature|Legislative]] authority is vested in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. It is unicameral and has 150 members, known as deputies, of whom 75 are elected by plurality to represent single-member district, and 75 are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation. Members of parliament are elected for four-year terms. Five parties and electoral blocs had representatives elected to the parliament in the [[Georgian legislative election, 2008|2008 elections]]: the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] (governing party), The Joint Opposition, the [[Christian-Democratic Movement (Georgia)|Christian-Democrats]], the [[Georgian Labour Party|Labour Party]] and [[Republican Party of Georgia|Republican Party]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated a new Parliament building in the western city of [[Kutaisi]], in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |title=Georgia opens new parliament in Kutaisi, far from the capital |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although considerable progress was made since the [[Rose revolution]], former President Mikheil Saakashvili stated in 2008 that Georgia is still not a &quot;full-fledged, very well-formed, crystalized society.&quot;&lt;ref name=misha&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Leader: Country on Right Track |publisher=Fox News |date=January 7, 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0,4670,GeorgiaPresidentialElection,00.html |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |first=Lynn |last=Berry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080108095512/http://www.foxnews.com:80/wires/2008Jan07/0,4670,GeorgiaPresidentialElection,00.html |archivedate=8 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political system remains in the process of transition, with frequent adjustments to the balance of power between the President and Parliament, and opposition proposals ranging from transforming the country into parliamentary republic to re-establishing the [[Monarchy of Georgia|monarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgiaToday&quot;&gt;Zaza Jgharkava (October 18, 2007).

Different opinions exist regarding the degree of political freedom in Georgia. Saakashvili believed in 2008 that the country is &quot;on the road to becoming a European democracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=misha/&gt; [[Freedom House]] lists Georgia as a partly free country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2008 |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111119094909/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for 2012 parliamentary elections, Parliament adopted a new electoral code on 27 December 2011 that incorporated many recommendations from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Venice Commission. However, the new code failed to address the Venice Commission’s primary recommendation to strengthen the equality of the vote by reconstituting single-mandate election districts to be comparable in size. On December 28, Parliament amended the Law on Political Unions to regulate campaign and political party financing. Local and international observers raised concerns about several amendments, including the vagueness of the criteria for determining political bribery and which individuals and organizations would be subject to the law. As of March 2012, Parliament was discussing further amendments to address these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5253.htm |title=Georgia |publisher=State.gov |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|elections in October 2012]] resulted in the victory for the opposition &quot;[[Georgian Dream|Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia]]&quot; [[Coalition#Politics and government|coalition]], which President Saakashvili acknowledged on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Saakashvili Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Election|newspaper=Civil|date=2 October 2012 |url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia maintains good relations with its direct neighbours (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and [[Turkey]]) and is a member of the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]], the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], the [[Community of Democratic Choice]], the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]], and the [[Asian Development Bank]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Georgia also maintains political, economic, and military relations with [[Japan]], [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=371&amp;lang_id=ENG |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia – Oriental Republic of Uruguay |publisher=Mfa.gov.ge |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=386&amp;lang_id=ENG |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia – Visa Information for Foreign Citizens|publisher=Mfa.gov.ge |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}} (South Korea is on the list of the countries whose citizens do not need a visa to enter and stay on the territory of Georgia for 360 days)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=309&amp;lang_id=ENG|title=Ministry of Foreignn Affairs of Georgia – Relations between Georgia and the State of Israel|publisher=mfa.gov.ge|accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=379&amp;lang_id=ENG |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia – Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka |publisher=Mfa.gov.ge |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]], and many other countries.

The growing U.S. and European Union influence in Georgia, notably through proposed EU and NATO membership, the U.S. [[Georgia Train and Equip Program|Train and Equip]] military assistance program, and the construction of the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]] have frequently strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow. Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |title=U.S. Announces New Military Assistance Program for Georgia |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=July 1, 2001 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia is currently working to become a full member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]. In August 2004, the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia was submitted officially to NATO. On 29 October 2004, the [[North Atlantic Council]] of NATO approved the [[NATO#International Partnership Action Plans|Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) of Georgia, and Georgia moved on to the second stage of Euro-Atlantic Integration. In 2005, by the decision of the President of Georgia, a state commission was set up to implement the Individual Partnership Action Plan, which presents an interdepartmental group headed by the Prime Minister. The Commission was tasked with coordinating and controlling the implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan.

On 14 February 2005, the agreement on the appointment of [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) liaison officer between Georgia and NATO came into force, whereby a liaison officer for the South Caucasus was assigned to Georgia. On March 2, 2005, the agreement was signed on the provision of the host nation support to and transit of NATO forces and NATO personnel. On March 6–9, 2006, the IPAP implementation interim assessment team arrived in Tbilisi. On April 13, 2006, the discussion of the assessment report on implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan was held at NATO Headquarters, within 26+1 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=89&amp;lang_id=ENG |title=Georgia's way to NATO |publisher=Mfa.gov.ge |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Georgian parliament voted unanimously for the bill which calls for integration of Georgia into NATO. The majority of Georgians and politicians in Georgia support the push for NATO membership.

Georgia's military is organized into [[Georgian Army|land]] and [[Georgian Air Force|air]] forces. They are collectively known as the Georgian Armed Forces (GAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission and functions of the GAF are based on the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]], Georgia’s Law on Defense and National Military Strategy, and international agreements to which Georgia is signatory. They are performed under the guidance and authority of the Ministry of Defense.

Georgia contributed nearly 1,000 soldiers to the [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan, making it the highest troop contributor per-capita to the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Saakashvili, Mikheil. &quot;Why Georgia sends troops to Afghanistan&quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/6809222/Why-Georgia-sends-troops-to-Afghanistan.html The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Law enforcement in Georgia (country)}}
[[File:Tbilisi, Georgia — Georgian Police's new patrol car (3).jpg|thumb|left|Georgian police's new patrol car [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan|Ford Taurus Police Interceptor]]]]
In Georgia, law enforcement is conducted and provided for by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies. New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police'. Intelligence collecting in the interests of national security is now the remit of the [[Georgian Intelligence Service]].

In 2005, President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] fired the entire traffic police force (numbering around 30,000 police officers) of the Georgian National Police due to corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclatchydc.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark McDonald, Knight Ridder Newspapers |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/190/story/11216.html |title=Firing of traffic police force stands as a symbol of hope in Georgia &amp;#124; McClatchy |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |date=|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4849472 |title=Georgia's National Police Corruption Project |publisher=NPR |date=September 15, 2005 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new force was then subsequently built around new recruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclatchydc.com&quot;/&gt; The [[US State Department]]'s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law-Enforcement Affairs has provided assistance to the training efforts and continues to act in an advisory capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OXU/is_8_60/ai_n15387346 Building security in the Republic of Georgia] ''Andrew Stamer'' Retrieved 1 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The government came under criticism for its alleged use of excessive force on 26 May 2011 when it dispersed protesters led by [[Nino Burjanadze]], among others, with tear gas and rubber bullets after they refused to clear [[Rustaveli avenue]] for an independence day parade despite the expiration of their demonstration permit and despite being offered to choose an alternative venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.az/articles/Georgia/37341 |title=US, Britain, call for probe into May 26 events in Georgia |publisher=News.Az |date=May 28, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Denber, Europe and Central Asia deputy director |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/05/26/georgia-police-used-excessive-force-peaceful-protests |title=Georgia: Police Used Excessive Force on Peaceful Protests &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tbilisi Mayor's Offers Protesters Alternative Venues for Rally|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23518|publisher=Civil.ge|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-AP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=13688230#.TvZtt_LntDp|title=Georgian Police Say 2 Killed in Protest Dispersal|last=MISHA|first=DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI|date=26 May 2011|work=[[ABC News]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While human rights activists maintained that the protests were peaceful, the government pointed out that many protesters were masked and armed with heavy sticks and molotov cocktails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audio, Video Recordings Implicate Protest Leaders to 'Plotting Violence'|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23537|publisher=Civil.ge|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said the accusations of planning a coup were baseless, and that the protesters' actions were legitimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-AP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding in Moscow and agencies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/09/georgia-protests-mikheil-saakashvili |title=Thousands gather for street protests against Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bisected by the Caucasus Mountains; the area north of the Greater Caucasus range is called Ciscaucasia and the region to the south Transcaucasia. Inhabited from ancient times, it was under nominal Persian and Turkish suzerainty until conquered by Russia in the 18th–19th centuries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cesww.fas.harvard.edu/ces_definition.html|title=CESWW – Definition of Central Eurasia |publisher=Cesww.fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[40th meridian east|40°]] and [[47th meridian east|47° E]], with an area of {{convert|67900|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is a very mountainous country.

Because of a complex geographic setting, mountains also isolate the northern region of [[Svaneti]] from the rest of Georgia.

The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border of Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The main roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between South and North Ossetia and the [[Darial Gorge]] (in the Georgian region of [[Khevi]]). The Roki Tunnel was vital for the Russian military in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] because it is the only direct route through the Caucasus Mountains. The southern portion of the country is bounded by the [[Lesser Caucasus|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The [[Greater Caucasus|Greater Caucasus Mountain Range]] is much higher in elevation than the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, with the highest peaks rising more than {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount [[Shkhara]] at {{convert|5068|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and the second highest is Mount Janga ([[Dzhangi-Tau]]) at {{convert|5059|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Other prominent peaks include [[Mount Kazbek]] at {{convert|5047|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Shota Rustaveli {{convert|4860|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Tetnuldi {{convert|4858|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Mt.

The region between [[Kazbek]] and Shkhara (a distance of about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers. Out of the 2,100 glaciers that exist in the Caucasus today, approximately [[Glaciers of Georgia|30% are located within Georgia]].
[[File:Keselo, Tusheti.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tusheti]] region in northeast Georgia]]
The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The area can be split into two separate sub-regions; the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run parallel to the Greater Caucasus Range, and the [[Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland]], which lies immediately to the south of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.

The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the [[Javakheti Volcanic Plateau]], lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major [[List of rivers of Georgia (country)|rivers in Georgia]] are the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] and the [[Mtkvari River|Mtkvari]]. The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.

The [[Krubera Cave]] is the deepest known cave in the world. It is located in the [[Arabika Massif]] of the [[Gagra Range]], in Abkhazia. In 2001, a Russian–Ukrainian team had set the world depth record for a cave at {{convert|1710|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. In 2004, the penetrated depth was increased on each of three expeditions, when a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team crossed the {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} mark for the first time in the history of [[speleology]]. In October 2005, an unexplored part was found by the CAVEX team, further increasing the known depth of the cave. This expedition confirmed the known depth of the cave at {{convert|2140|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.

===Topography===
[[File:Ushba 1879.jpg|thumb|[[Ushba]], a prominent peak of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Svanetian Caucasus]]]]

The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied. Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and [[temperate rainforest]]s to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains. Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the [[alpine tundra|alpine]]/[[subalpine zone|subalpine]] zone accounts for roughly around 10 percent of the land.

Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of the agricultural development of the land and urbanization. The large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (e.g. [[Lake Paliastomi]] area). At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains. Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and contain species such as [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]], [[elm]], [[ash tree|ash]], and [[Sweet Chestnut|chestnut]]. Evergreen species such as [[Buxus|box]] may also be found in many areas. Ca. 1000 of all 4000 higher plants of Georgia are endemic in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endemic-species-caucasus.info/ |title=Endemic Species of the Caucasus |publisher=Endemic-species-caucasus.info |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vardzia.jpg|thumb|left|View of the cave city of [[Vardzia]] and the valley of the [[Kura River]] below]]

The west-central slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]] as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by [[temperate rain forests]]. Between {{convert|600|-|1000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life. The zone is made up mainly of beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]] forests. From {{convert|1500|-|1800|m|ft|0}}, the forest becomes largely coniferous. The tree line generally ends at around {{convert|1800|m|ft|0}} and the alpine zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the 3,000 metre line.

Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the [[Likhi Range]]) is considerably different from that of the west, although, much like the Colchis plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the [[Mtkvari]] and [[Alazani]] River plains have been deforested for agricultural purposes. In addition, because of the region's relatively drier climate, some of the low-lying plains (especially in Kartli and south-eastern Kakheti) were never covered by forests in the first place.

The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains. In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 percent of the forests of the region are deciduous. Coniferous forests only dominate in the [[Borjomi Gorge]] and in the extreme western areas. Out of the deciduous species of trees, [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[hornbeam]] dominate. Other deciduous species include several varieties of [[maple]], [[aspen]], ash, and [[hazelnut]]. The Upper Alazani River Valley contains [[Taxus baccata|yew]] forests.

At higher elevations above {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (particularly in the [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]] regions), [[Scots Pine|pine]] and [[birch]] forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between {{convert|500|-|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with the alpine zone extending from 2,000–2,300 to 3,000–3,500 metres (6,562–7,546 to 9,843–11,483&amp;nbsp;ft). The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the [[Alazani]] Valley of Kakheti. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|sing=on}} line in most areas of eastern Georgia.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Georgia (country)}}
The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size. There are two main climatic zones, roughly the separating eastern and western parts of the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south as well.

[[File:Black Sea coast of Georgia (country), with skyline of Batumi on the horizon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Black Sea]] coast of western Georgia, with the skyline of [[Batumi]] on the horizon]]

Much of western Georgia lies within the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from {{convert|1000|–|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The precipitation tends to be uniformly distributed throughout the year, although the rainfall can be particularly heavy during the Autumn months. The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year, the foothills and mountainous areas (including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters (snow cover often exceeds 2 meters in many regions). Ajaria is the wettest region of the [[Caucasus]], where the Mt. Mtirala [[temperate rain forest|rainforest]], east of [[Kobuleti]] receives around {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year.

Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental. The region's weather patterns are influenced both by dry Caspian air masses from the east and humid Black Sea air masses from the west. The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by several mountain ranges ([[Likhi]] and [[Meskheti]]) that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation. Annual precipitation is considerably less than that of western Georgia and ranges from {{convert|400|–|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The wettest periods generally occur during spring and autumn, while winter and summer months tend to be the driest. Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers (especially in the low-lying areas) and relatively cold winters. As in the western parts of the nation, elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia where climatic conditions above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}} are considerably colder than in the low-lying areas. The regions that lie above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} frequently experience frost even during the summer months.

[[File:CaucasianOvcharka-Julius.jpg|thumb|[[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]]]]

Because of its high landscape diversity and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 1,000 species of [[vertebrates]], (330 birds, 160 fish, 48 [[reptiles]], and 11 [[amphibians]]). A number of large [[carnivores]] live in the forests, namely [[Brown bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]]es and [[Caucasian leopard|Caucasian Leopards]]. The [[common pheasant]] (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important [[game bird]]. The species number of [[invertebrates]] is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications. The spider checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caucasus-spiders.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caucasus-spiders.info/introduction/checklists/ |title=Caucasian Spiders &quot; CHECKLISTS &amp; MAPS |publisher=Caucasus-spiders.info |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090328225817/http://caucasus-spiders.info:80/introduction/checklists/ |archivedate=28 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly more than 6,500 species of fungi, including lichen-forming species, have been recorded from Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;Nakhutsrishvili, I.G.

The true total number of fungal species occurring in Georgia, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot;. Edn 10.

Archaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical [[Silk Road]]. Gold, silver, copper and [[iron ore|iron]] have been mined in the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. [[Georgian wine]] making is a very old tradition and a key branch of the country's economy.

For much of the 20th century, Georgia's economy was within the Soviet model of [[command economy]]. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a [[free market]] economy. As with all other [[post-Soviet states]], Georgia faced a severe economic collapse. The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis. The agriculture and industry output diminished. By 1994 the gross domestic product had shrunk to a quarter of that of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Bank in Georgia 1993-2007|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCOUASSEVAL/Resources/GeorgiaCAE.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=14 August 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first financial help from the West came in 1995, when the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] granted Georgia a credit of USD 206 million and Germany granted [[German mark|DM]] 50 million.

===Transport===

{{main|Transport in Georgia (country)}}
[[File:E60 Sakartvelo.jpg|left|thumb|A green directional sign on the [[European route E60#Georgia|ს 1]] motorway, denoting it as such.]]
Today transport in Georgia is provided by means of [[Georgian Railway|rail]], road, shipping and air travel. Positioned in the Caucasus and on the coast of the Black Sea, Georgia is a key country through which energy imports to the European Union from neighbouring Azerbaijan pass. Traditionally the country was located on an important north-south trade route between [[European Russia]] and the [[Near East]] and Turkey.

In recent years Georgia has invested large amounts of money in the modernization of its transport networks. The construction of new highways has been prioritized and, as such, major cities like Tbilisi have seen the quality of their roads improve dramatically; despite this however, the quality of inter-city routes remains poor and to date only one [[motorway]]-standard road has been constructed - the ს 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georoad.ge/?que=eng/statistics/roads |title=Roads Department of Georgia |publisher=Georoad.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian railways represent an important transport artery for the Caucasus as they make up the largest proportion of a route linking the Black and [[Caspian Sea]]s, this in turn has allowed them to benefit in recent years from increased energy exports from neighbouring Azerbaijan to the European Union, Ukraine and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.ge/?web=0&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=407&amp;lang=eng |title=Georgian Railway |publisher=Railway.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger services are operated by the state-owned [[Georgian Railways]] whilst freight operations are carried out by a number of licensed operators. Since 2004 the Georgian Railways have been undergoing a rolling program of fleet-renewal and managerial restructuring which is aimed at making the service provided more efficient and comfortable for passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.ge/?web=0&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=245&amp;lang=eng |title=Georgian Railway |publisher=Railway.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructural development has also been high on the agenda for the railways, with the key Tbilisi railway junction expected to undergo major reorganisation in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.ge/?web=0&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=242&amp;lang=eng |title=Georgian Railway |publisher=Railway.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional projects also include the construction of the economically important [[Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway]], which for the first time will connect much of the Caucasus with Turkey by [[standard gauge]] railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.ge/?web=0&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=290&amp;lang=eng |title=Georgian Railway |publisher=Railway.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air and maritime transport is developing in Georgia, with the former mainly used by passengers and the latter for transport of freight. Georgia currently has four international airports; the largest of which is by far [[Tbilisi International Airport]], hub for [[Georgian Airways]], which offers connections to many large European cities. Other airports in the country are largely underdeveloped or lack scheduled traffic, although, as of late, efforts have been made to solve both these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolutsia.net/kutaisis-airport-georgias-opportunity/ |title=Kutaisi's airport: Georgia's opportunity |publisher=Evolutsia.Net |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120229115503/http://www.evolutsia.net:80/kutaisis-airport-georgias-opportunity/ |archivedate=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of seaports along Georgia's Black Sea coast, the largest and most busy of which is the Port of Batumi; whilst the town is itself a seaside resort, the port is a major cargo terminal in the Caucasus and is often used by neighbouring Azerbaijan as a transit point for making energy deliveries to Europe. Scheduled and chartered passenger ferry services link Georgia with Ukraine and Turkey.

The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] is one of the world's most ancient Christian Churches, and claims apostolic foundation by [[Saint Andrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriarchate.ge/_en/?action=istoria |title=Patriarchate of Georgia - Official web-site |publisher=Patriarchate.ge |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 4th century, Christianity was adopted as the state religion of Iberia (present-day Kartli, or eastern Georgia), following the missionary work of [[Saint Nino]] of [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Toumanoff1963&quot;&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]], &quot;Iberia between Chosroid and Bagratid Rule&quot;, in ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', Georgetown, 1963, pp. 374-377.

The special status of the Georgian Orthodox Church is officially recognised in the Constitution of Georgia and the [[Concordat of 2002]], although religious institutions are separate from the state, and every citizen has the right of religion.

Religious minorities of Georgia include [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christians]] (3.9 percent), Muslims (9.9 percent), and Roman Catholics (0.8 percent).&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; [[Islam in Georgia (country)|Islam]] is represented by both Azerbaijani [[Shia]] Muslims (in the south-east) ethnic Georgian [[Sunni]] Muslims in Adjara, and [[Laz language|Laz]]-speaking Sunni Muslims as well as Sunni [[Meskhetian Turks]] along the border with Turkey. There are also smaller communities of [[Greek Muslims]] (of [[Pontic Greek]] origin) and [[Armenian Muslims]], both of whom are descended from Ottoman-era converts to Turkish Islam from [[Eastern Anatolia]] who settled in Georgia following the [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign]] that led to the Ottoman conquest of the country in 1578. Georgian Jews trace the history of their community to the 6th century BC; their numbers have dwindled in the last decades due to strong immigration to [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Dan Norman.

Despite the long history of religious harmony in Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;Spilling, Michael. Georgia (Cultures of the world). 1997&lt;/ref&gt; there have been several instances of religious discrimination and violence against &quot;nontraditional faiths&quot;, such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], by the followers of the [[defrocked]] Orthodox priest [[Basil Mkalavishvili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/georgia/georgia_memo_full.htm |title=Memorandum to the U.S. Government on Religious Violence in the Republic of Georgia (Human Rights Watch August 2001) |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional religious organizations, Georgia retains [[Secularism and Irreligion in Georgia|secular and irreligious segments of society]], as well as a significant portion of religiously affiliated individuals who do not actively practice their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CAD-20.pdf Caucasus Analytical Digest No.20], [[Heinrich Böll Foundation|Heinrich Böll Stiftung]], 11 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping modernizing, although controversial, reforms since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4724213.stm Georgia purges education system. The [[BBC News]]. July 29, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molly Corso (May 13, 2005) [http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav041305.shtml Education reform rocks Georgia].

Students with a secondary school certificate have access to higher education. Only the students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of scores he/she received at the exams.

Most of these institutions offer three levels of study: a Bachelor's Program (three to four years); a Master's Program (two years), and a Doctoral Program (three years). There is also a Certified Specialist's Program that represents a single-level higher education program lasting from three to six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;tempus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mes.gov.ge/index.php?module=text&amp;link_id=50 Education institutions].

Capital Tbilisi has become the main artery of the Georgian educational system, particularly since the creation of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|First Georgian Republic]] in 1918 permitted the establishment of modern, Georgian-language educational institutions. Tbilisi is the home to several major institutions of higher education in Georgia, notably the [[Tbilisi State Medical University]], which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918, and the [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU), which was established in 1918 and remains the oldest university in the entire Caucasus region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbilisi.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=1297&amp;info_id=6933 |title=New Tbilisi.Gov.Ge - თბილისის მერიის ოფიციალური ვებ გვერდი |publisher=Tbilisi.gov.ge |date=|accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With enrollment of over 35,000 students, the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) at TSU is approximately 5,000. Georgia's main and largest technical university, [[Georgian Technical University]], as well as the [[The University of Georgia (Tbilisi)]], [[Caucasus University]] and [[Free University of Tbilisi]] are also in Tbilisi.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Georgia (country)}}

[[File:Torso - Georgia National museum.JPG|thumb|right|upright|2nd century BC bronze torso from Western Georgia, displayed at the [[Georgian National Museum]]]]

Georgian culture evolved over thousands of years with its foundations in [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] and Colchian civilizations,&lt;ref&gt;Georgia : in the mountains of poetry 3rd rev. ed., Nasmyth, Peter&lt;/ref&gt; continuing into the rise of the unified Georgian Kingdom under the single monarchy of the [[Bagrationi]]. Georgian culture enjoyed a [[Georgian Golden Age|golden age and renaissance]] of [[classical literature]], arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts''. Peeters Publishers, ISBN 90-429-1318-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian language, and the Classical Georgian literature of the poet [[Shota Rustaveli]], were revived in the 19th century after a long period of turmoil, laying the foundations of the [[Romanticism|romantics]] and novelists of the modern era such as [[Grigol Orbeliani]], [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]], [[Ilia Chavchavadze]], [[Akaki Tsereteli]], [[Vazha Pshavela]], and many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang David, Georgians&quot;&gt;Lang David, Georgians&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian culture was influenced by [[Classical Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the various [[Persian Empire|Iranian empires]] (notably the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]],&lt;ref&gt;I. Gagoshidze &quot;The Achaemenid influence in Iberia&quot; Boreas 19. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehsan Yarshater|Yarshater, Ehsan]]. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=wBIZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=the+achaemenid+influence+in+iberia&amp;dq=the+achaemenid+influence+in+iberia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMIyZuLtcDoyAIVRF4PCh0vYwmQ &quot;Encyclopedia Iranica&quot;] Routledge &amp; Keagan Paul, 2001. ISBN 978-0933273566 pp 464-479&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]], [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Qajar Empire|Qajar]] empires), and later, from the 19th century, by the [[Russian Empire]].

Georgians have their own unique three [[Georgian alphabet|alphabets]] which according to traditional accounts was invented by King [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia]] in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]]. ''Georgia''. p. 515.{{Request quotation|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.101languages.net/georgian/writing_system.html|title=Georgian Alphabet|publisher=101languages.net|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia is well known for its rich [[folklore]], unique traditional music, theatre, cinema, and art. Georgians are renowned for their love of music, dance, theatre and cinema. In the 20th century there have been notable Georgian painters such as [[Niko Pirosmani]], [[Lado Gudiashvili]], [[Elene Akhvlediani]]; ballet choreographers such as [[George Balanchine]], [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]], and [[Nino Ananiashvili]]; poets such as [[Galaktion Tabidze]], [[Lado Asatiani]], and [[Mukhran Machavariani]]; and theatre and film directors such as [[Robert Sturua]], [[Tengiz Abuladze]], [[Georgi Daneliya|Giorgi Danelia]] and [[Otar Ioseliani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang David, Georgians&quot;/&gt;

===Architecture and arts===
Georgian architecture has been influenced by many civilizations. There are several different architectural styles for [[castles]], [[tower]]s, [[fortifications]] and churches. The Upper Svaneti fortifications, and the castle town of [[Shatili]] in [[Khevsureti]], are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian castle architecture. Other architectural aspects of Georgia include [[Rustavelis Gamziri|Rustaveli]] avenue in Tbilisi in the Hausmann style, and the Old Town District.

[[File:Changing skyline of Batumi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|As Georgia's Black Sea coast continues to develop, modern high-rises are making headway into [[Batumi]]'s traditionally [[classical architecture|classical]] cityscapes.]]

Georgian ecclesiastic art is one of the most notable aspects of Georgian Christian architecture, which combines classical [[dome]] style with original [[basilica]] style forming what is known as the Georgian cross-dome style. Cross-dome architecture developed in Georgia during the 9th century; before that, most Georgian churches were basilicas. Other examples of Georgian ecclesiastic architecture can be found outside Georgia: [[Bachkovo Monastery]] in Bulgaria (built in 1083 by the Georgian military commander Grigorii Bakuriani), [[Iviron monastery]] in Greece (built by Georgians in the 10th century), and the [[Monastery of the Cross]] in Jerusalem (built by Georgians in the 9th century).

The art of Georgia spans the [[prehistoric]], the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], Roman, [[medieval]], [[ecclesiastic]], [[Iconography|iconic]] and modern [[visual arts]]. One of the most famous late 19th/early 20th century Georgian artists is a [[primitivist]] painter [[Niko Pirosmani]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Georgia (country)}}
Georgia has a rich and vibrant musical tradition, primarily known for its early development of [[polyphony]]. Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances. Each region in Georgia has its own traditional music with Persian influenced drones and ostinato-like soloists in the east, complex improvised harmonies in the west, and solid moving chords in Svanetie.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Georgian cuisine}}
[[File:Khinkali with beer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Georgian signature dish [[khinkali]] with beer]]

[[Georgian cuisine]] and [[Georgian wine|wine]] have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era. One of the most unusual traditions of dining is [[Supra (feast)|supra]], or ''Georgian table'', which is also a way of socialising with friends and family. The head of ''supra'' is known as [[tamada]]. He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, [[khinkali]] (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and [[khachapuri]], mainly from [[Imereti]], [[Samegrelo]] and Adjara. In addition to traditional Georgian dishes, the foods of other countries have been brought to Georgia by immigrants from Russia, [[Greece]], and recently China.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Georgia}}
[[File:Georgia vs Romania 2011 RWC (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgia]] vs. [[Romania]] in the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]].]]
The most popular sports in Georgia are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[rugby union]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]], and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Romans erected the statue of the Iberian King Pharsman after he demonstrated Georgian training methods during his visit to Rome; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'', LXIX, 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman style of wrestling]] incorporates many Georgian elements.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Douglas. ''Georgia in my Heart'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. There were a number of other styles in the past that are not as widely used today. For example, the [[Khevsureti]] region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling. Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were [[polo]], and [[Lelo burti|Lelo]], a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.

The first and only race circuit in the Caucasian region is located in Georgia. [[Rustavi International Motorpark]] originally built in 1978 was re-opened in 2012 after total reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rustavi2.com/news/news_text.php?id_news=45318&amp;pg=1&amp;im=main&amp;ct=0&amp;wth=0 |title=Rustavi 2 Broadcasting Company|publisher=Rustavi2.com |date=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; costing $20 million. The track satisfies the [[FIA]] Grade 2 requirements and currently hosts the [[Legends car racing]] series and Formula Alfa competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.ge/news-view/37425/en |title=Georgian National Broadcaster|publisher=1tv.ge |date=April 30, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball]] always was one of the notable sports in Georgia, which had a few very famous [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union national team]] members, such as: [[Otar Korkia]], [[Mikhail Korkia]], [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] and [[Levan Moseshvili]]. [[BC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] won prestigious [[Euroleague]] competition in [[1961–62 FIBA European Champions Cup|1962]]. Georgia totally had five players in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]: [[Vladimir Stepania]], [[Jake Tsakalidis]], [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]], [[Tornike Shengelia]] and current [[Milwaukee Bucks]] member [[Zaza Pachulia]]. Other notable basketball players are: two times Euroleague champion [[Giorgi Shermadini]] and Euroleague players [[Manuchar Markoishvili]] and [[Viktor Sanikidze]]. The sport branch is regaining its popularity in country over the past years. [[Georgia national basketball team]] qualified to [[EuroBasket]] during last three tournaments since 2011.

'''The Gambia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Gambia.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|b|i|ə}}; {{lang-ar|غامبيا}} ''{{transl|ar|ghamabia}}''), officially the '''Republic of the Gambia''' and often called simply '''Gambia''') is a country in West Africa mostly surrounded by [[Senegal]] with a short strip of its coastline bordered with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at its western end. It is the smallest country on mainland Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare&quot;&gt;Hoare, Ben. (2002) ''The Kingfisher A-Z Encyclopedia'', Kingfisher Publications. p. 11. ISBN 0-7534-5569-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gambia is situated on either side of the [[Gambia River]], the nation's namesake, which flows through the centre of the Gambia and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is {{convert|10689|km²|sqmi}} with a population of 1,882,450 at the 15 April 2013 Census (provisional). [[Banjul]] is the Gambian capital, and the largest cities are [[Serekunda]] and [[Brikama]].

The Gambia shares historical roots with many other West African nations in the [[slave trade]], which was the key factor in the placing and keeping of a colony on the Gambia River, first by the Portuguese, during which era it was A Gâmbia, and later, on 25 May 1765,&lt;ref&gt;“Historical Dictionary of The Gambia,” by Arnold Hughes, David Perfect, pg. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; the Gambia was made a part of the British colony when the government formally assumed control, establishing the Province of Senegambia. On 18 February 1965, the Gambia gained independence from the United Kingdom. Since gaining independence, the Gambia has had two leaders – [[Dawda Jawara]], who ruled from 1970 until 1994, when the current leader [[Yahya Jammeh]] seized power in a coup as a young army officer.&lt;ref name=Wiseman&gt;Wiseman, John A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=jj4J-AXGDaQC&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;ots=JHubx1ooyv&amp;dq=%22yahya%20jammeh%22%20jawara%20coup%201994&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q=%22yahya%20jammeh%22%20jawara%20coup%201994&amp;f=false Africa South of the Sahara 2004 (33rd edition): The Gambia: Recent History], Europa Publications Ltd., 2004, page 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gambia's economy is dominated by farming, fishing, and especially tourism. About a third of the population lives below the [[international poverty line]] of US$1.25 a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf ''Human Development Indices''], Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35.

==History==

{{Main|History of the Gambia}}

[[Arab]] traders provided the first written accounts of the Gambia area in the ninth and tenth centuries. During the tenth century, Muslim merchants and scholars established communities in several West African commercial centres. Both groups established trans-Saharan trade routes, leading to a large trade in [[slaves]], gold, [[ivory]] (exports) and manufactured goods (imports).

By the 11th or 12th century, the rulers of kingdoms such as [[Takrur]] (a monarchy centred on the [[Senegal River]] just to the north), ancient Ghana and Gao, had converted to Islam and had appointed Muslims who were literate in the [[Arabic language]] as courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;Easton P Education and Koranic Literacy in West Africa IK Notes on Indigenous Knowledge and Practices, n° 11, World Bank Group 1999 p 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 14th century, most of what is today called Gambia was part of the [[Mali Empire]]. The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century, and they began to dominate overseas trade.

In 1588, the claimant to the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese throne]], [[António, Prior of Crato]], sold exclusive trade rights on the [[Gambia River]] to English merchants. [[Letters patent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] confirmed the grant. In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an English company for trade with the Gambia and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of the Gambia were under [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]]'s rule, and had been bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]], who was a [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] [[vassal]].

During the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] struggled continually for political and commercial supremacy in the regions of the Senegal River and the Gambia River. The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel]] landed there—following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.

As many as three million [[slavery|slaves]] may have been taken from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many slaves were taken by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans; others were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and others were simply victims of kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Mungo Park, ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v. II, Chapter XXII – War and Slavery].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Island and Fort Gambia.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[James Island (Gambia)|James Island]] and [[Fort Gambia]]]]

Traders initially sent slaves to Europe to work as servants until the market for labour expanded in the [[West Indies]] and North America in the 18th century. In 1807, the United Kingdom abolished the [[slave trade]] throughout its empire. It also tried, unsuccessfully, to end the slave trade in the Gambia. Slave ships intercepted by the Royal Navy's [[West Africa Squadron]] in the Atlantic were also returned to the Gambia, with liberated slaves released on MacCarthy Island far up the Gambia River where they were expected to establish new lives.&lt;ref name=xyz&gt;[[Patrick Webb]]. 1994. Guests of the Crown: Convicts and Liberated Slaves on McCarthy Island, The Gambia.  Geographical Journal. 160 (2): 136–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The British established the military post of Bathurst (now [[Banjul]]) in 1816.

===Gambia Colony and Protectorate (1821–1965)===

[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-25-4.jpg|thumb|left|The British Governor, [[George Chardin Denton]] (1901-1911), and his party, 1905]]

{{Further|Gambia Colony and Protectorate}}

In the ensuing years, Banjul was at times under the jurisdiction of the British Governor-General in [[Sierra Leone]]. In 1888, The Gambia became a separate colony.

An agreement with the [[French Republic]] in 1889 established the present boundaries. The Gambia became a [[British Crown colony]] called [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]], divided for administrative purposes into the colony (city of Banjul and the surrounding area) and the protectorate (remainder of the territory). The Gambia received its own executive and legislative councils in 1901, and it gradually progressed toward self-government. Slavery was abolished in 1906 and following a brief conflict between the colonial forces and rebellious indigenous inhabitants British colonial authority was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;The Gambia Colony and Protectorate: An Official Handbook (Library of African Study), 1906, 1967, by Frances Bisset Archer, ISBN  978-0714611396, pg.90-94&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, some soldiers fought with the [[Allies of World War II]]. Though these soldiers fought mostly in [[Burma]], some died closer to home and a [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] cemetery is in Fajara (close to Banjul). Banjul contained an [[airstrip]] for the [[US Army Air Forces]] and a port of call for Allied naval convoys.

After World War II, the pace of constitutional reform increased. Following general elections in 1962, the United Kingdom granted full internal self-governance in the following year.

===Independence (1965)===

The Gambia achieved [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|independence]] on 18 February 1965, as a constitutional monarchy within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[The Gambia (Commonwealth realm)|Queen of The Gambia]], represented by the [[Governor-General of The Gambia|Governor-General]]. Shortly thereafter, the national government held a referendum proposing that the country become a [[republic]]. This referendum failed to receive the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution, but the results won widespread attention abroad as testimony to The Gambia's observance of secret balloting, honest elections, civil rights, and liberties.

On 24 April 1970, The Gambia became a republic within the Commonwealth, following a second referendum. Prime Minister Sir [[Dawda Kairaba Jawara]] assumed the office of [[President of The Gambia|President]], an [[executive presidency|executive post]], combining the offices of [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

The Gambia was led by President Sir Dawda Jawara, who was re-elected five times. The relative stability of the Jawara era was first shattered by an attempted coup on 29 July 1981, which followed a weakening of the economy and allegations of corruption against leading politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdp.uu.se&quot;&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], Gambia, In depth: Economic crisis and a leftist coup attempt in 1981, viewed on 8 July 2013, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=60&amp;regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa#&lt;/ref&gt; The coup attempt occurred while President Jawara was visiting London and was carried out by the leftist [[National Revolutionary Council]], composed of [[Kukoi Samba Sanyang]]'s Socialist and Revolutionary Labour Party (SRLP) and elements of the &quot;Field Force&quot; (a paramilitary force which constituted the bulk of the country's armed forces).&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdp.uu.se&quot; /&gt;

President Jawara immediately requested military aid from [[Senegal]], which deployed 400 troops to The Gambia on 31 July. By 6 August, some 2,700 Senegalese troops had been deployed, defeating the rebel force.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdp.uu.se&quot; /&gt; Between 500 and 800 people were killed during the coup and the resulting violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdp.uu.se&quot; /&gt;

In 1982, in the aftermath of the 1981 attempted coup, Senegal and The Gambia signed a treaty of confederation. The [[Senegambia Confederation]] aimed to combine the armed forces of the two states and to unify their economies and currencies. After just seven years, The Gambia permanently withdrew from the confederation in 1989.

In 1994, the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC) [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|deposed the Jawara government]] and banned opposition political activity. Lieutenant [[Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh]], chairman of the AFPRC, became head of state. The then 29-year-old dictator remains president to this day. The AFPRC announced a transition plan for return to democratic civilian government. The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) was established in 1996 to conduct national elections. The PIEC was transformed to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in 1997 and became responsible for registration of voters and conduct of elections and referendums.

In late 2001 and early 2002, The Gambia completed a full cycle of [[Gambian presidential election, 2001|presidential]], [[Gambian parliamentary election, 2002|legislative]], and local elections, which foreign observers deemed free, fair, and transparent, albeit with some shortcomings. President Yahya Jammeh, who was elected to continue in the position he had assumed during the coup, took the oath of office again on 21 December 2001. Jammeh's [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]] (APRC) maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly, particularly after the main opposition [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections,&lt;ref name=&quot;backgroundnote&quot;&gt;{{StateDept |section |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5459.htm#politics |title=Background Note: The Gambia}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has participated in elections since.

On 2 October 2013, The Gambian interior minister announced that The Gambia would leave the Commonwealth of Nations with immediate effect, ending 48 years of membership of the organisation. The Gambian Government said it &quot;decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nocom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24376127|title=UK regrets The Gambia's withdrawal from Commonwealth|publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013}}

==Geography==

[[File:Ga-map.png|250px|thumb|Map of the Gambia]]

{{Main|Geography of the Gambia}}

The Gambia is a very small and narrow country whose borders mirror the meandering [[Gambia River]]. It lies between latitudes [[13th parallel north|13]] and [[14th parallel north|14°N]], and longitudes [[13th meridian west|13]] and [[17th meridian west|17°W]].

The Gambia is less than {{convert|48.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide at its widest point, with a total area of {{convert|11295|km2|abbr=on}}. About {{convert|1300|km2|abbr=on}} (11.5%) of the Gambia's area is covered by water. It is the smallest country on the African mainland. In comparative terms, the Gambia has a total area slightly less than that of the island of [[Jamaica]].

Senegal surrounds the Gambia on three sides, with {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline on the Atlantic Ocean marking its western extremity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciageography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html#Geo |title=The Gambia – Geography |accessdate=8 January 2009 |date=18 December 2008 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present boundaries were defined in 1889 after an agreement between the United Kingdom and France. During the negotiations between the French and the British in Paris, the French initially gave the British around {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the Gambia River to control. Starting with the placement of boundary markers in 1891, it took nearly 15 years after the Paris meetings to determine the final borders of the Gambia. The resulting series of straight lines and arcs gave the British control of areas about 16 km (about 10 miles) north and south of the Gambia River.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===

The Gambia has a tropical climate. A hot and rainy season normally lasts from June until November, but from then until May,  cooler temperatures predominate, with less precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciageography&quot; /&gt; The climate in the Gambia closely resembles that of neighbouring Senegal, of southern [[Mali]], and of the northern part of [[Benin]].&lt;ref name='hayward'&gt;

{{Main|Politics of the Gambia}}

Following independence in 1965, the Gambia conducted freely contested elections every five years. Each election was won by [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|The People's Progressive Party]] (PPP), headed by [[Dawda Jawara]]. The PPP dominated Gambian politics for nearly 30 years. After spearheading the movement toward complete independence from Britain, the PPP was voted into power and was never seriously challenged by any opposition party. The last elections under the PPP regime were held in April 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

In 1994, following corruption allegations against the Jawara regime and widespread discontent in the army, a largely bloodless and successful ''coup d'état'' installed army Lieutenant [[Yahya Jammeh]] into power. Politicians from deposed President Jawara's PPP and other senior government officials were banned from participating in politics until July 2001. A [[Gambian presidential election, 1996|presidential election]] took place in September 1996, in which Yahya Jammeh won 56% of the vote. The [[Gambian parliamentary election, 1997|legislative elections]] held in January 1997 were dominated by the APRC, which captured 33 out of 45 seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

In July 2001, the ban on Jawara-era political parties and politicians was lifted. Four registered opposition parties participated in 18 October 2001 [[Gambian presidential election, 2001|presidential election]], which the incumbent, President Yahya Jammeh, won with almost 53% of the votes. The APRC maintained its strong majority in the [[National Assembly of the Gambia|National Assembly]] in [[Gambian parliamentary election, 2002|legislative elections]] held in January 2002, particularly after the main opposition [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

Jammeh won the 2006 election handily after the opposition coalition, the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]], splintered earlier in the year. The voting was generally regarded as free and fair, though events from the run-up raised criticism from some. A journalist from the state television station assigned to the chief opposition candidate, [[Ousainou Darboe]], was arrested. Additionally, Jammeh said, &quot;I will develop the areas that vote for me, but if you don't vote for me, don't expect anything&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 and 22 March 2006, amid tensions preceding the 2006 presidential elections, an alleged planned military coup was uncovered. President Yahya Jammeh immediately returned from a trip to [[Mauritania]], many army officials were arrested, and prominent army officials fled the country. Some believe the planned coup was fabricated by the President for his own purposes, but no proof has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/Homepage/tabid/36/nnpg367/3/cmd367/arch/archDt367/032006/Default.aspx|title=Freedom Newspaper Online, March 2006 articles|date=March 2006|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their roles in an alleged 2009 coup plot, eight Gambians, including the former Chief of Defence Staff of the Gambian Armed Forces, a former head and deputy head of the National Intelligence Agency, and others were tried for treason, found guilty, and sentenced to death in July 2010. One of the convicted, a businessman, disappeared while in custody awaiting his appeal. Before that trial concluded, the former Chief of Defence Staff and the former Chief of the Gambia Naval Staff were charged with treason for their complicity in the failed 2006 coup. A key prosecution witness, serving a lengthy prison sentence for his role in the 2006 coup plot, received a presidential pardon, apparently in return for his testimony.

The 1970 constitution, which divided the government into independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches, was suspended after the 1994 military coup. As part of the transition process, the AFPRC established the Constitution Review Commission (CRC) through [[decree]] in March 1995. In accordance with the timetable for the transition to a democratically elected government, the CRC drafted a new constitution for the Gambia, which was approved by referendum in August 1996. The constitution provides for a strong presidential government, a [[unicameral]] legislature, an independent judiciary, and the protection of human rights.

In November 2011, elections were held under conditions that the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) characterised as &quot;not to be conducive for the conduct of free, fair and transparent polls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; These elections, which were not monitored by ECOWAS, returned Jammeh to another five-year term.

On 22 August 2012, the Gambia announced it would execute all death-row convicts, 42 men and two women, by September 2012. The country had not executed anyone in the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karimi,|first=Faith|title=Gambia vows to execute all death row inmates by September, sparking outcry|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/23/world/africa/gambia-inmates-execution/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine were executed in August 2012.

In December 2014, a [[2014 Gambian coup d'état attempt|failed coup attempt]] by American-Gambian dual citizens, including U.S. military veterans, was reported in Gambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/how-former-us-army-officer-launched-disastrous-coup-the-gambia |title=The reckless plot to overthrow Africa's most absurd dictator |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2015, President Jammeh declared The Gambia to be an [[Islamic republic]], in what he said was designed to distance the country further from its colonial past.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35082343 |title=Gambia declared Islamic republic by President Yahya Jammeh |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(12 December 2015) [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/12/gambia-now-an-islamic-republic-says-president-yahya-jammeh &quot;The Gambia now an Islamic republic, says President Yahya Jammeh&quot;].

===Foreign relations===

{{Main|Foreign relations of the Gambia}}

[[File:Yahya Jammeh with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Yahya Jammeh]] and Mrs. Zineb Jammeh with [[Barack Obama|Barack]] and [[Michelle Obama]] in the [[White House]], August 2014]]

The Gambia followed a formal policy of nonalignment throughout most of former President Jawara's tenure. It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained the Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most nonhumanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]]. Since 1995, President Jammeh has established diplomatic relations with several additional countries, including [[Libya]] (suspended in 2010), [[The Gambia–Taiwan relations|Republic of China]] (Taiwan, terminated in Nov 2013), and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5459.htm &quot;Background note: The Gambia&quot;]. U.S. Department of State (October 2008).{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China|People's Republic of China]] cut ties with the Gambia in 1995 after the latter established diplomatic links with [[Taiwan]].{{Why?|date=November 2015}}

The Gambia plays an active role in international affairs, especially West African and Islamic affairs, although its representation abroad is limited. As a member of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), the Gambia has played an active role in that organisation's efforts to resolve the civil wars in [[Liberia]] and Sierra Leone and contributed troops to the community's [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ceasefire monitoring group]] (ECOMOG) in 1990 and ([[ECOMIL]]) in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

The Gambia has also sought to mediate disputes in nearby [[Guinea-Bissau]] and the neighbouring [[Casamance]] region of Senegal. The government of the Gambia believes Senegal was complicit in the March 2006 failed coup attempt. This has put increasing strains on relations between the Gambia and its neighbour. The subsequent worsening of the human rights situation has placed increasing strains of US–Gambian relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

The Gambia withdrew from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 3 October 2013, the government stating it had &quot;decided that the Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24376127|title=UK regrets The Gambia's withdrawal from Commonwealth|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===

{{Further|Military of the Gambia}}

The Gambian Armed Forces consists of the Gambia National Army, Republican Guards comprising a well-trained and equipped Presidential Guards and the Special Forces, and the Navy, all under the authority of the Ministry of Defence (a ministerial portfolio held by Jammeh).  Prior to the 1994 coup, the Gambian Armed Forces received technical assistance and training from the [[The Gambia–United States relations|United States]], United Kingdom, [[Republic of China–The Gambia relations|People's Republic of China]], Nigeria, and Turkey.  With the withdrawal of most of this aid, the Army has received renewed assistance from Turkey, Pakistan and others. A number of junior Gambian Army officers are regularly trained at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], and sergeants from the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] were observed training Gambian troops in Bakau in November 2010.

The Gambia allowed its military training arrangement with Libya to expire in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

Members of the Gambian military participated in ECOMOG, the West African force deployed during the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]] beginning in 1990. Gambian forces have subsequently participated in several other peacekeeping operations, including [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Eritrea]], and [[East Timor]]. The Gambia contributed 150 troops to Liberia in 2003 as part of the ECOMIL contingent.&lt;ref name=&quot;BellamyWilliams&quot;&gt;Alex J. Bellamy, Paul D.

===Administrative divisions===

{{Stack|{{Districts of The Gambia Image Map}}}}
{{Main|Districts of the Gambia}}

The Gambia is divided into eight [[Divisions of the Gambia|local government areas]], including the national capital, Banjul, which is classified as a city. The Divisions of the Gambia were created by the Independent Electoral Commission in accordance to Article 192 of the [[Constitution of the Gambia|National Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gambiacon&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The local government areas are further subdivided (2013) into 43 [[Districts of the Gambia|districts]]. Of these, Kanifing and Kombo Saint Mary (which shares [[Brikama]] as a capital with the Brikama Local Government Area) are effectively part of the Greater Banjul area.&lt;ref&gt;

==Economy==

[[File:Gambia Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphical depiction of Gambian product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]
{{Main|Economy of the Gambia}}

The Gambia has a liberal, [[Market economy|market-based economy]] characterised by traditional subsistence agriculture, a historic reliance on groundnuts (peanuts) for export earnings, a re-export trade built up around its ocean port, low import duties, minimal administrative procedures, a fluctuating exchange rate with no exchange controls, and a significant tourism industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

The World Bank pegs Gambian GDP for 2011 at US$898M; the International Monetary Fund puts it at US$977M for 2011.

From 2006 to 2012, the Gambian economy grew annually at a pace of 5–6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;Hatab Fadera, [http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/gambia-to-commence-rail-system-in-2013-discloses-president-jammeh-as-he-opens-parliament &quot;Gambia to commence rail system in 2013:- Discloses President Jammeh, as he opens parliament&quot;], ''The Daily Observer'', 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture accounts for roughly 30% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs about 70% of the labour force. Within agriculture, peanut production accounts for 6.9% of GDP, other crops 8.3%, livestock 5.3%, fishing 1.8%, and forestry 0.5%. Industry accounts for about 8% of GDP and services around 58%. The limited amount of manufacturing is primarily agricultural-based (e.g., peanut processing, bakeries, a brewery, and a tannery). Other manufacturing activities include soap, [[soft drinks]], and clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

Previously, the United Kingdom and other EU countries constituted the major Gambian domestic export markets. However, in recent years Senegal, the United States, and Japan have become significant trade partners of the Gambia. In Africa, Senegal represented the biggest trade partner of the Gambia in 2007, which is a defining contrast to previous years that had Guinea-Bissau and Ghana as equally important trade partners. Globally, Denmark, the United States, and China have become important source countries for Gambian imports. The UK, Germany, [[Ivory Coast]], and the Netherlands also provide a fair share of Gambian imports. The Gambian trade deficit for 2007 was $331 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

As of May 2009, 12 commercial banks were in the Gambia, including one Islamic bank. The oldest of these, [[Standard Chartered Bank]], dates its presence back to the entry in 1894 of what shortly thereafter became [[Bank of British West Africa]]. In 2005, the Swiss-based banking group, International Commercial Bank, established a subsidiary and has now four branches in the country. In 2007, Nigeria's [[Access Bank (Nigeria)|Access Bank]] established a subsidiary that now has four branches in the country, in addition to its head office; the bank has pledged to open four more.
In May 2009, the Lebanese Canadian Bank opened a subsidiary called [[Prime Bank (Gambia)|Prime Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/another-new-bank-inaugurated |title=Prime Bank (Gambia) is the 12th commercial bank in the Gambia |publisher=Observer.gm |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==

===Demographics===

[[File:1907190-Travel Picture-The Gambia.jpg|thumb|Youth in the Gambia]]
{{Main|Demographics of the Gambia}}

The urbanization rate as of 2011 was 57.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisional figures from the 2003 census show that the gap between the urban and rural populations is narrowing as more areas are declared urban. While urban migration, development projects, and modernisation are bringing more Gambians into contact with Western habits and values, indigenous forms of dress and celebration and the traditional emphasis on the extended family remain integral parts of everyday life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt;

The UNDP's Human Development Report for 2010 ranks the Gambia 151st out of 169 countries on its Human Development Index, putting it in the 'Low Human Development' category. This index compares life expectancy, years of schooling, gross national income (GNI) per capita and some other factors.

The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated at 3.98 children/woman in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===

A variety of [[ethnic group]]s live in the Gambia, each preserving its own language and traditions. The [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] ethnicity is the largest, followed by the [[Fula people|Fula]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Soninke people|Serahule]], [[Serer people|Serers]], [[Karoninka people|Karoninka]], [[Manjago people|Manjago]] and the [[Bianunka people|Bianunkas]]. The Krio people, locally known as [[Aku people|Akus]], constitute one of the smallest ethnic minorities in the Gambia. They are descendants of the [[Sierra Leone Creole people]] and have been traditionally concentrated in the capital.

The roughly 3,500 non-African residents include Europeans and families of Lebanese origin (0.23% of the total population).&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot; /&gt; Most of the European minority is&lt;!-- most is singular --&gt; [[British people|British]], many of whom left after independence.

===Languages===

English is the official language of the Gambia, whilst [[English language|English]] used to be until recently. Other languages are [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Serer language|Serer]], [[Krio language|Krio]] and other indigenous vernaculars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html CIA Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Specify other after this--&gt; Due to the country's geographical setting, knowledge of [[French language|French]] (an official language in much of West Africa) is relatively widespread.

===Education===

[[File:Gambian classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom at [[Armitage High School]]]]

{{Main|Education in the Gambia}}

The constitution mandates free and compulsory primary education in the Gambia. Lack of resources and educational infrastructure has made implementation of this difficult.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/gambia.htm &quot;The Gambia&quot;]. ''2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2002). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the gross primary enrollment rate was 77.1% and the net primary enrollment rate was 64.7%&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; School fees long prevented many children from attending school, but in February 1998, President Jammeh ordered the termination of fees for the first six years of schooling.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Girls make up about 52% of primary school students. The figure may be lower for girls in rural areas, where cultural factors and poverty prevent parents from sending girls to school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Approximately 20% of school-age children attend Quranic schools.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

===Health===

Public expenditure was at 1.8% of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 5.0%.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdrstats.undp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_GMB.html |title=Human Development Report 2009 – Gambia |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 11 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s. Life expectancy at birth was at 59.9 for females in 2005 and for males at 57.7.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdrstats.undp.org&quot;/&gt;

According to the World Health Organization in 2005, an estimated 78.3% of Gambian girls and women have suffered [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Female genital mutilation and other harmful practices |publisher=Who.int |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Gambia is 400. This is compared with 281.3 in 2008 and 628.5 in 1990. The under-5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births, is 106 and the neonatal mortality, as a percentage of under-5 mortality, is 31. In Gambia, the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is five and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is one in 49.

Under President Jammeh, the Gambia has improved public health. In October 2012, it was reported that the country has made significant improvements in polio, measles immunisation, and the PCV-7 vaccine.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaccinenewsdaily.com&quot;&gt;Paul Tinder, [http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/africa/320220-university-of-the-gambia-launches-public-health-masters-programs/ &quot;University of The Gambia launches public health masters programs&quot;], ''Vaccine News Daily'', 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gambia was certified as polio-free in 2004. &quot;The Gambia EPI program is one of the best in the World Health Organization African Region,&quot; Thomas Sukwa, a representative of the WHO, said, according to the ''Foroyaa'' newspaper. &quot;It is indeed gratifying to note that the government of the Gambia remains committed to the global polio eradication initiative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vaccinenewsdaily.com&quot;/&gt;

According to ''Vaccine News Daily'':&lt;ref name=&quot;vaccinenewsdaily.com&quot;/&gt;

* The Gambia is tied for third place in Africa for [[measles|measles immunisation]] among one-year-old children.
* The Gambia is tied for fourth place in the world for the [[DPT vaccine|DTP3 immunisation]] for one-year-old children.
* The Gambia is ranked second in Africa for &quot;feverish children under the age of five who received [[malaria|antimalarial]] treatment, according to ''Trading Economics''.&quot;

A group called [[Power Up Gambia]] operates in the Gambia to provide solar power technology to health care facilities, ensuring greater access to electricity.

Recently, Riders for Health, an international aid group focused on sub-Saharan countries in Africa, was noted for providing enough health-care vehicles for the entire country. Riders for Health manage and maintain vehicles for the government. The initiative addresses a major barrier to universal health care—transport—and allows health workers to visit three times as many villages every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2961141-1/fulltext |title=June 1–7, 2013 |publisher=The Lancet |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Constitution of the Gambia|constitution]] protects the rights of citizens to practise any religion that they choose.&lt;ref name='chap4con'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlii.org/gm/legis/const/1997/5.html |title=CHAPTER IV – PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS |accessdate=14 January 2009 |year=1997 |work=Constitution of the Republic of The Gambia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Reuters reported that the Gambia was declared to be an Islamic state by the country's president, Yahya Jammeh. Islam is the predominant religion, practised by 90% of the country's population. The majority of the Muslims in the Gambia adhere to [[Sunni]] laws and traditions.&lt;ref name='irfr07'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90099.htm |title=Gambia, The |accessdate=14 January 2009 |date=14 September 2007 |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all commercial life in the Gambia comes to a standstill during major Muslim holidays, including [[Eid al-Adha]] and [[Eid ul-Fitr]].&lt;ref&gt;The Gambia &amp; Senegal, By Andrew Burke, David Else, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslims in the Gambia follow the [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Land, Law and Islam, By Siraj Sait, Hilary Lim, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a Shiite Muslim community exists in the Gambia, mainly from [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and other [[Arab people|Arab-speaking]] [[immigrants]] to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wow.gm/africa/gambia/article/2008/6/23/shia-presence-in-gambia |title=Shia Presence in Gambia: |publisher=Wow.gm |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian community represents about 8% of the population. Residing in the western and the southern parts of the Gambia, most of the Christian community identifies themselves as [[Roman Catholic]]. However, smaller Christian groups are present, such as [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and small evangelical denominations.&lt;ref name='irfr07'/&gt;

The remaining 1.97% of the population adheres to [[Traditional African religion|indigenous]] beliefs, such as the [[Serer religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.htmlCIA the World Factbook]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Serer religion encompasses cosmology and a belief in a supreme deity called ''Rog''. Some of its religious festivals include the ''Xoy'', ''Mbosseh'', and ''Randou Rande''. Each year, adherents to Serer religion make the annual pilgrimage to [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]] in Senegal for the ''Xoy'' divination ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Kalis. Medecine Traditionnele Religion et Divination Chez Les Seereer Siin Du Senegal. L'Harmattan (1997). ISBN 2-7384-5196-9&lt;/ref&gt; Serer religion also has a rather significant imprint on Senegambian Muslim society in that all [[Senegambian]] Muslim festivals such as &quot;Tobaski&quot;, &quot;Gamo&quot;, &quot;Koriteh&quot; and &quot;Weri Kor&quot; are [[loanword]]s from the Serer religion as they were ancient Serer festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye. « Chronique du royaume du Sine, suivie de Notes sur les traditions orales et les sources écrites concernant le royaume du Sine par Charles Becker et Victor Martin (1972)», .

Like the Serers, the [[Jola people]] also have their own religious customs. One of the major religious ceremonies of the Jolas is the [[Boukout]].

Due to immigration from South Asia, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hindus]] and followers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are present.&lt;ref name='irfr07'/&gt;

==Culture==

[[File:1014067-Serrekunda_arena_for_wrestling-The_Gambia.jpg|thumb|Drummers at a wrestling match]]

Although the Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, its culture is the product of very diverse influences. The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as &quot;the River.&quot; Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.

Europeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'' which was set in the Gambia.

===Music===

{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}

The music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely. It fuses popular Western music and dance, with ''[[sabar]]'', the traditional drumming and dance music of the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people]].

===Cuisine===

The [[cuisine of Gambia]] includes peanuts, rice, fish, meat, onions, tomatoes, cassava, chili peppers and oysters from the River Gambia that are harvested by women.

===Media===

Critics have accused the government of restricting free speech. A law passed in 2002 created a commission with the power to issue licenses and imprison journalists; in 2004, additional legislation allowed prison sentences for libel and slander and cancelled all print and broadcasting licenses, forcing media groups to re-register at five times the original cost.&lt;ref name=BBCCountryProfile&gt;

Three Gambian journalists have been arrested since the coup attempt. It has been suggested that they were imprisoned for criticising the government's economic policy, or for stating that a former interior minister and security chief was among the plotters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper editor [[Deyda Hydara]] was shot to death under unexplained circumstances, days after the 2004 legislation took effect.

Licensing fees are high for newspapers and radio stations, and the only nationwide stations are tightly controlled by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCCountryProfile&quot; /&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] has accused &quot;President Yahya Jammeh's police state&quot; of using murder, arson, unlawful arrest and death threats against journalists.&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2010 Musa Saidykhan, former editor of ''The Independent'' newspaper, was awarded US$200,000 by the ECOWAS Court in Abuja, Nigeria. The court found the Government of the Gambia guilty of torture while he was detained without trial at the National Intelligence Agency. Apparently he was suspected of knowing about the 2006 failed coup.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Football===

Association football in the Gambia is administered by the [[Gambia Football Association]], who are affiliated to both [[FIFA]] and [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]. The GFA runs league football in the Gambia, including top division [[GFA League First Division]], as well as the [[Gambia national football team]]. Nicknamed ''The Scorpions'', the national side have never qualified for either the [[FIFA World Cup]] or the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] finals at senior levels. The Gambia won two CAF U-17 championships one in 2005 when the country hosted, and 2009 in Algeria automatically qualifying for FIFA U-17 World Cup in Peru (2005) and Nigeria (2009) respectively. The U-20 also qualified for FIFA U-20 2007 in Canada. The female U-17 also competed in FIFA U-17 World Cup 2012 in Azerbaijan.
