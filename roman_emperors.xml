'''Augustus''' ({{lang-la|Imperātor Caesar Dīvī Fīlius Augustus}};&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;pronunciation&quot;&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of the names of Augustus:

#{{sqc|GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR OCTAVIANVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar ɔk.taː.wiˈaː.nʊs|IPA}}

The spelling {{sqc|AGVSTVS}}, indicating the pronunciation {{IPA-la|aˈgʊs.tʊs|}}, occurs in inscriptions ({{Harvnb|Allen|1965|p=61}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;The final name of Augustus, ''{{lang|la|Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus|}}'', means &quot;Commander Caesar, Son of the Divine, the Venerable&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 23 September 63 BC – 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the [[Roman Empire]] and its first [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]], ruling from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The dates of his rule are contemporary dates; Augustus lived under two calendars, the Roman Republican until [[45 BC|45&amp;nbsp;BC]], and the Julian after 45&amp;nbsp;BC. Due to departures from Julius Caesar's intentions, Augustus finished restoring the Julian calendar in March AD 4, and the correspondence between the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] and the calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC.(Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003: 670–1)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born '''Gaius Octavius''' into an old and wealthy [[Equestrian order|equestrian branch]] of the [[plebeian]] [[Octavii]] family. His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavian was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir. He, [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as [[military dictatorship|military dictators]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;As part of the Triumvirate, Octavian ruled the Western provinces, Antony ruled the Eastern provinces, and Lepidus ruled Africa&lt;/ref&gt; The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by Octavian in 31 BC.

After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward facade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrates|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]]. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps|Princeps Civitatis]]'' (&quot;First Citizen of the State&quot;). The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the [[Principate]], the first phase of the Roman Empire.

The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' (''The Roman Peace''). The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and one [[Year of Four Emperors|year-long civil war]] over the imperial succession. Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]]; expanding possessions in [[Africa Province|Africa]]; expanding into [[Germania]]; and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]].

Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an official [[courier]] system, established a standing army, established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[Cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[Vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign.

Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75. He may have died from natural causes, although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) [[Tiberius]].

{{IPA-la|awˈɡʊstʊs|classical}}) was known by many names throughout his life:&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;pronunciation&quot; /&gt;
* At birth, he was named '''Gaius Octavius''' after his [[Gaius Octavius|biological father]]. Historians typically refer to him simply as '''Octavius''' (or Octavian) between his birth in 63 until his adoption by Julius Caesar in 44 BC (after Julius Caesar's death).
* Upon his adoption, he took Caesar's name and became '''Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus''' in accordance with [[Adoption in Rome|Roman adoption]] [[Roman naming conventions|naming standards]]. He quickly dropped &quot;Octavianus&quot; from his name, and his contemporaries typically referred to him as &quot;Caesar&quot; during this period; historians, however, refer to him as '''Octavian''' between 44 BC and 27 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Ann Shelton, ''As the Romans Did'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 42 BC, Octavian began the ''[[Temple of Caesar|Temple of Divus Iulius]]'' or Temple of the [[Caesar's Comet|Comet Star]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', 2.93–94&lt;/ref&gt; and added '''Divi Filius''' (''Son of the Divine'') to his name in order to strengthen his political ties to Caesar's former soldiers by following the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification]] of Caesar, becoming '''Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius'''.
* In 38 BC, Octavian replaced his ''[[praenomen]]'' &quot;Gaius&quot; and ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' &quot;Julius&quot; with '''Imperator''', the [[Imperator|title by which troops hailed their leader after military success]], officially becoming '''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius'''.
* In 27 BC, following his defeat of Mark Antony and [[Cleopatra]], the Roman Senate voted new titles for him, officially becoming '''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus'''.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;meaning&quot; /&gt; It is the events of 27 BC from which he obtained his traditional name of '''Augustus''', which historians use in reference from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.

== Early life ==
{{Main|Early life of Augustus}}
While his paternal family was from the town of [[Velletri]], approximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Suetonius|2013|loc = §5, footnote a}} [[Roman calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the [[Palatine Hill]], very close to the [[Roman Forum]]. He was given the name '''Gaius Octavius Thurinus''', his [[cognomen]] possibly commemorating his father's victory at [[Thurii]] over a rebellious band of [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#7 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#5 5–6 on-line text].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his father's home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius only mentions his father's [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather [[Gaius Octavius (tribune 216 BC)|Gaius Octavius]] was a military tribune in [[Sicily]] during the [[Second Punic War]]. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named [[Gaius Octavius]], had been [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' The &quot;Marcus Octavius&quot; [[veto]]ing the [[agrarian law]] suggested by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133&amp;nbsp;BC may have been his ancestor. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#1 1–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 14&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Atia Balba Caesonia|Atia]], was the niece of Julius Caesar.

[[File:RSC 0022 - transparent background.png|thumb|left|A denarius from 44 BC, showing Julius Caesar on the obverse and the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] on the reverse of the coin]]
In 59&amp;nbsp;BC, when he was four years old, his father died.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 23&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother married a former governor of Syria, [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#4 4–8]; [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 3. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippus claimed descent from [[Alexander the Great]], and was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] in 56&amp;nbsp;BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother (and Julius Caesar's sister), [[Julia Caesaris (sister of Julius Caesar)|Julia Caesaris]].

In 52 or 51&amp;nbsp;BC, Julia Caesaris died. Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]; [[Quintilian]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio12.shtml#6 12.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the ''[[toga virilis]]'' four years later,&lt;ref name=Suet8.1&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to the [[College of Pontiffs]] in 47&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html ''Augustus''] 4. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was put in charge of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Greek games]] that were staged in honor of the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], built by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot; /&gt; According to [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in [[Africa (province)|Africa]], but gave way when his mother protested.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 6. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 46&amp;nbsp;BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of [[Pompey]], Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.

When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.&lt;ref name=Suet8.1 /&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius Paterculus]] reports that after that time, Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#59.3 2.59.3].&lt;/ref&gt; When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the [[Vestal Virgins]], naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.&lt;ref name=Suetonius_Julius&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise to power ==

=== Heir to Caesar ===
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Death of Caesar - Walters 37884.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Death of Caesar'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1867). On 15 March 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavius's adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in [[Apollonia, Illyria]], when Julius [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was killed]] on the [[Ides of March]] (15 March) 44&amp;nbsp;BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to [[Italia (Roman province)|Italy]] to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law,{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|His daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] had died in 54&amp;nbsp;BC.; his son [[Caesarion]] by Cleopatra was not recognized by Roman law and was not mentioned in his will.&lt;ref name=Suetonius_Julius /&gt;}} and so had [[adoption in Rome|adopted]] Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 15&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though [[Suetonius]] describes Antony's accusation as political slander.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#71 71].&lt;/ref&gt; After landing at Lupiae near [[Brundisium]], Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/3*.html#9 3.9–11].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name '''Gaius Julius Caesar'''. Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] in cognomen form (e.g., ''Octavianus'' for one who had been an Octavius, ''Aemilianus'' for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite book|last1=Cicero|title=Letters to Atticus|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|pages=16:14|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057.perseus-lat1:16.14|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that Octavius ever himself officially used the name ''Octavianus'', as it would have made his modest origins too obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay (2004), 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''Augustus'' pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as ''Octavian'' during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27&amp;nbsp;BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''Augustus'' pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9 10&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium,&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 19&quot; /&gt; Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against [[Parthia]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9 10&quot; /&gt; This amounted to 700 million [[sestertius|sesterces]] stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 18&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 19&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian made another bold move in 44&amp;nbsp;BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's [[Near East]]ern province&lt;!--[[Asia (Roman province)]]?--&gt; to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 18&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/3*.html#11 3.11–12].&lt;/ref&gt; On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in [[Campania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot; /&gt; By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 [[denarius|denarii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 24&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 27&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 20&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growing tensions ===
[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Augustus as a younger Octavian, dated ca. 30 BC]]
Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot; /&gt; Octavian found consul Mark Antony, Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins. They had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot; /&gt; This was due to his &quot;inflammatory&quot; eulogy given at Caesar's funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot; /&gt;

Mark Antony was amassing political support, but Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 11&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antony.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 114–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian began to make common cause with the [[Optimates]], the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] began to attack Antony in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]] portraying him as a threat to the Republican order.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 26&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 30&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would lend him control over [[Cisalpine Gaul]], which had been assigned as part of his province, from [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], one of Caesar's assassins.&lt;!---this sentence is convoluted, but requires someone knowledgeable to make sense of it---&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 11 12&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 21&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and, on 28 November, he won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 123–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot; /&gt;

=== First conflict with Antony ===
[[File:Bust of augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus in [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
Decimus Brutus refused to give up Cisalpine Gaul, so Antony besieged him at [[Mutina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell, 24&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence, as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him. This provided an opportunity for Octavian, who already was known to have armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot; /&gt; Cicero also defended Octavian against Antony's taunts about Octavian's lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesar's name, stating &quot;we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 29&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43&amp;nbsp;BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot; /&gt; In addition, Octavian was granted ''[[propraetor]]'' ''[[imperium]]'' (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with [[Aulus Hirtius|Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]] (the consuls for 43&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 43&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]], forcing Antony to retreat to [[Transalpine Gaul]]. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony, then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus—yet Octavian decided not to cooperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 26 27&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Octavian stayed in the [[Po Valley]] and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, an embassy of [[centurion]]s sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 32 33&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian also demanded that the decree should be rescinded which declared Antony a public enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot; /&gt; When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot; /&gt; He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43&amp;nbsp;BC was elected consul with his relative [[Quintus Pedius]] as co-consul.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 14&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 28&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], another leading Caesarian.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 176–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting near [[Bologna]] in October 43&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] called the [[Second Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 15&quot; /&gt; This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the [[plebs]], unlike the unofficial [[First Triumvirate]] formed by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus |Pompey]], Julius Caesar, and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 15&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard 1982 163&quot;&gt;Scullard (1982), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumvirs then set in motion [[proscription]]s in which 300 senators and 2,000 ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'' allegedly were branded as [[outlaw]]s and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 16&quot; /&gt;

The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by [[Appian]], although his earlier contemporary [[Livy]] asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Southern (1998), 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard 1982 164&quot;&gt;Scullard (1982), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 16&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing.  However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot; /&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot; /&gt;

This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius presented the case that Octavian, although reluctant at first to proscribe officials, nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot; /&gt; [[Plutarch]] described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother [[Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus|Paullus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Battle of Philippi and division of territory ====
{{Further|Liberators' civil war}}
On 1 January 42&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, ''[[Divus Iulius]]''. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was ''[[Divi filius]]'', &quot;Son of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavian then sent 28 [[Roman legions|legions]] by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; After two [[Battle of Philippi|battles at Philippi]] in Macedonia in October 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] committed [[suicide]]. Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17 18&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17 18&quot; /&gt;

After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. [[Gaul]] and the provinces of Hispania and Italia were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to [[Egypt]] where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18&quot; /&gt; There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18 19&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====
There was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot; /&gt; Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot; /&gt;

Lucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 32&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 32&quot; /&gt; This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor]]
[[Sextus Pompeius]] was the son of First Triumvir Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 162&lt;/ref&gt; Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, who was a member of the republican party, ironically, not the Caesarian faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot; /&gt; Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40&amp;nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia]], a daughter of [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]] who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law.&lt;!---whose father in law? Sextus', Octavian's? And who was a follower of whom? Very unclear syntax---&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot; /&gt; Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]], little more than a year after their marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot; /&gt;

While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] and had fathered three children with her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40&amp;nbsp;BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot;&gt;Eck (2003) 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot; /&gt;

In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot; /&gt; To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, [[Octavia Minor]], in marriage to Antony in late 40&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot; /&gt; During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as [[Antonia Major]] and [[Antonia Minor]]).

==== War with Pompeius ====
{{Further|Sicilian revolt}}

[[File:Denarius Sextus Pompeius-Scilla.jpg|thumb|A [[denarius]] of [[Sextus Pompeius]], minted for his victory over Octavian's fleet, on the obverse the Pharus of [[Messina]], who defeated Octavian, on the reverse, the monster [[Scylla]]]]
Sextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying shipments of grain through the Mediterranean to the peninsula. Pompeius' own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot; /&gt; Pompeius' control over the sea prompted him to take on the name ''Neptuni filius'', &quot;son of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 22&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[treaty of Misenum]]; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, [[Corsica]], Sicily, and the [[Peloponnese]], and ensured him a future position as consul for 35&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 22&quot; /&gt;

The territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 23&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, however, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard 1982 163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 24&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's [[Battle of Carrhae|defeat at Carrhae]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 24&quot; /&gt; In an agreement reached at [[Taranto|Tarentum]], Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 [[Legionary|legionaries]] to Antony for use against Parthia.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25&quot; /&gt;

Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25 26&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by general Agrippa at the naval [[Battle of Naulochus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot; /&gt; Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces, where he was captured and executed in [[Miletus]] by one of Antony's generals the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius' troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot; /&gt; Lepidus' troops deserted him, however, and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by Octavian's promises of money.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot; /&gt;

Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and effectively was exiled to a [[villa]] at Cape Circei in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard 1982 164&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot; /&gt; The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire. This time, he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, while also returning 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners—slaves who had fled to join Pompeius' army and navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26 27&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister [[tribune of the plebs|tribunal]] [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]], or ''[[sacrosanct]]itas'', in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 27 28&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War with Antony ====
{{Main|Final War of the Roman Republic}}
[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema- Anthony and Cleopatra.JPG|thumb|''Anthony and Cleopatra'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]

Meanwhile, Antony's campaign turned disastrous against Parthia, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 29&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength; he already was engaged in a romantic affair with her, so he decided to send Octavia back to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 29 30&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian used this to spread [[propaganda]] implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an &quot;Oriental [[Intimate relationship|paramour]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 30&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 36&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir—if only Antony would do the same. Antony refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 20&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman troops captured the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] in 34&amp;nbsp;BC, and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia. He also awarded the title &quot;Queen of Kings&quot; to Cleopatra, acts that Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 30&quot; /&gt; Octavian became consul once again on 1 January 33&amp;nbsp;BC, and he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antony's grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 31&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breach between Antony and Octavian prompted a large portion of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32&amp;nbsp;BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 32 34&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 34&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian forcibly entered the [[Temple of Vesta|temple of the Vestal Virgins]] and seized Antony's secret will, which he promptly publicized. The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated [[Alexandria]] as the site for a tomb for him and his queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 34 35&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 21 22&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 32&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 35&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 22&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|''The [[Battle of Actium]]'', by [[Laureys a Castro]], painted 1672, National Maritime Museum, London]]
In early 31&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the [[Adriatic Sea]] under the command of Agrippa.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern [[Corfu]]) and marched south.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot; /&gt; Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot; /&gt;

Antony's fleet sailed through the bay of [[Actium]] on the western coast of Greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the [[Blockade|naval blockade]]. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and [[Gaius Sosius]] in the battle of Actium on 2 September 31&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 38&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and his remaining forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 38 39&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian pursued them and defeated their forces in Alexandria on 1 August 30&amp;nbsp;BC—after which Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Antony fell on his own sword and was taken by his soldiers back to Alexandria where he died in Cleopatra's arms. Cleopatra died soon after, reputedly by the venomous bite of an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] or by poison.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 39&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian had exploited his position as Caesar's heir to further his own political career, and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do so the same. He, therefore, followed the advice of [[Arius Didymus]] that &quot;two Caesars are one too many&quot;, ordering Caesarion to be killed (Julius Caesar's son by Cleopatra), while sparing Cleopatra's children by Antony, with the exception of Antony's [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus|older son]].&lt;ref&gt;Green (1990), 697.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 49&quot; /&gt;

After Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial [[principate]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34 35&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; — but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38 39&quot; /&gt; Marching into Rome, Octavian and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Marcus Agrippa]] were elected as dual [[Roman consul|consul]]s by the Senate.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 45&quot; /&gt;

Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the [[Roman province]]s. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 44 45&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First settlement ===
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire|History of the Constitution of the Roman Empire}}

[[File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus as a magistrate. The statue's marble head was made c. 30–20&amp;nbsp;BC, the body sculpted in the 2nd century AD ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], [[Paris]]).]]
In 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot; /&gt; Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] for senatorial debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot; /&gt; The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot; /&gt; Historian [[Werner Eck]] states:

{{bquote|The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire. All of them taken together formed the basis of his ''auctoritas'', which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 113&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To a large extent, the public were aware of the vast financial resources that Augustus commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 80&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the ''[[Aerarium|aerarium Saturni]]'', the public treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 80&quot; /&gt;

According to H. H. Scullard, however, Augustus's power was based on the exercise of &quot;a predominant military power and&amp;nbsp;... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Scullard_p211&quot;&gt;Scullard (1982), 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]]. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 46&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The provinces ceded to him for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Ægyptus|Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 46&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot; /&gt; The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot; /&gt; Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot; /&gt;

The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional [[Roman agriculture|producer of grain]], as well as [[Illyria]] and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot; /&gt; However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Augustus, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot;&gt;CCAA, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Scullard_p211&quot; /&gt;

The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican façade for the autocratic Principate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot; /&gt; Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces followed Republican-era precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus, wearing the [[Civic Crown]]. [[Glyptothek]], [[Munich]].]]
On 16 January 27&amp;nbsp;BC the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[Princeps]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Augustus'' is from the Latin word ''Augere'' (meaning to increase) and can be translated as &quot;the illustrious one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a title of religious authority rather than political authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot; /&gt; According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity—and in fact nature—that went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name served to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian. 

His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than ''Romulus'', the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of [[Romulus and Remus]] (founders of Rome), which symbolized a second founding of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot; /&gt; The title of ''Romulus'' was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image that Octavian tried to avoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 149&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'' comes from the Latin phrase ''primum caput'', &quot;the first head&quot;, originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial [[roster]]. In the case of Augustus, however, it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge.&lt;ref&gt;Eck (2003), 3, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'' had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, Pompey had held the title. 

Augustus also styled himself as ''Imperator Caesar divi filius'', &quot;Commander Caesar son of the deified one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt; With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt; The word ''Caesar'' was merely a cognomen for one branch of the [[Julius|Julian family]], yet Augustus transformed ''Caesar'' into a new family line that began with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt;

Augustus was granted the right to hang the ''[[corona civica]]'' above his door, the &quot;civic crown&quot; made from oak, and to have laurels drape his doorposts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat to the general &quot;''[[memento mori]]''&quot;, or &quot;Remember that you are mortal&quot;. Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital. 

However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a [[scepter]], wearing a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], or wearing the golden crown and purple [[toga]] of his predecessor Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 13&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the [[Curia]], bearing the inscription ''virtus'', ''pietas'', ''clementia'', ''iustitia''—&quot;valor, piety, clemency, and justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 3&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second settlement ==
[[File:Roman - Portrait of Emperor Augustus - Walters 2321.jpg|thumb|left|Portraits of Augustus show the emperor with idealized features]]
By 23&amp;nbsp;BC, some of the un-Republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27&amp;nbsp;BC. Augustus' policy of holding of an annual consulate drew attention to his dominance over the Roman political system, at the same time cutting in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still purported to be the head of the Roman state&lt;!---what does this sentence mean?---&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;If the testimony of [[Marcus Primus]] can be believed, where during his trial for illegally launching a war in Thrace, he asserted that he acted on the orders of Marcellus and Augustus&amp;nbsp;– see Southern, p. 108 and Eck (2003), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; alienating his three biggest supporters&amp;nbsp;– Agrippa, [[Maecenas]], and Livia.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling pressure from his own core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help. 

He appointed noted Republican [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (consul 23 BC)|Calpurnius Piso]] for co-consul in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, after his choice [[Aulus Terentius Varro Murena]] was executed as part of the Marcus Primus Affair,&lt;ref&gt;Ando, p. 140; Raaflaub, p. 426; Wells, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to bolster his support there, especially with the Republicans. (Murena had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, p. 259&quot;&gt;Davies, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;)

In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the Principate in some form,&lt;ref&gt;Southern, p. 108; Holland, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time put into doubt the senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt; However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt; This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38 39&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stern, Gaius p. 23&quot;&gt;Stern, Gaius, ''Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus' vision of a new world order in 13 BC'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, it was Augustus' intent to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that no matter what the constitutional rules were, they would continue to obey Agrippa.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 294–295; Southern, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] showing Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 20–50]]
Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his annual consulship.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt; The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, p. 259&quot; /&gt; This was a clever ploy by Augustus; his ceasing to perennially be one of two annual consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position, while at the same time Augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot; /&gt; Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, along with the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===
The primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 37&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.

A second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the &quot;Marcus Primus Affair&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern p. 109&quot;&gt;Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; In late 24 or early 23&amp;nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, p. 108&quot;&gt;Southern, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath — i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius'' — as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, p. 108&quot; /&gt; Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&amp;nbsp;– accusations that had already played out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stern, Gaius p. 23&quot; /&gt;

The situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, pg, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot; /&gt; Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt;

=== Additional powers ===
During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot; /&gt; For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', or the immunity from physical attack given to a [[tribune of the plebs|Tribune of the Plebeians]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 59&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 30&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 80&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state.   However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus' amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 427&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''[[Via Labicana Augustus]]''—Augustus as [[Pontifex Maximus]].]]
Augustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular &quot;imperium&quot; when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot; /&gt; Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award in 19&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot; /&gt; (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the [[Garamantes]].) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph — for victories in Germania in 7&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conspiracy ===
Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus' greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&amp;nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&amp;nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt; After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply &quot;by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''&quot;, and ended the crisis almost immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt; It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 78&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus, seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]]]]

Nevertheless, there were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern p. 109&quot;/&gt; Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.&lt;ref&gt;Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]] was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 53; Holland, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 260; Holland, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot; /&gt; In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot; /&gt; as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/2*.html#10 10.2]. Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13&amp;nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 28&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or &quot;father of the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay (2004), 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 129&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stability and staying power ===
A final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81].&lt;/ref&gt; If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 337–338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus' powers were now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Everett (2006), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (''[[toga picta]]''), which became the imperial insignia well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era.

The yellow legend represents the extent of the Republic in 31&amp;nbsp;BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of Augustus, and pink areas on the map represent [[client state]]s; however, areas under Roman control shown here were subject to change even during Augustus' reign, especially in [[Germania]].]]

''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus'' chose ''Imperator'' (&quot;victorious commander&quot;) to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed &quot;imperator&quot; as his title after a successful battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot; /&gt; Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''Res Gestae'' was devoted to his military victories and honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot; /&gt;

Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''—&quot;Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 30&quot; /&gt; The impulse for [[expansionism]] apparently was prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where Jupiter promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'', &quot;sovereignty without end&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 95&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]])&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of Raetia and [[Noricum]] (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia),&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt; [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.),&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt; and had extended the borders of the [[Africa Province]] to the east and south.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of [[Tiberius]], a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successor.]]

[[Iudaea Province|Judea]] was added to the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]] when Augustus deposed [[Herod Archelaus]], successor to [[client state|client king]] [[Herod the Great]] (73–4&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt; Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt;

Again, no military effort was needed in 25&amp;nbsp;BC when [[Galatia]] (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after [[Amyntas of Galatia]] was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot; /&gt; The rebellious tribes of [[Asturias]] and  [[Cantabria]] in modern-day Spain were [[Cantabrian Wars|finally quelled in 19&amp;nbsp;BC]], and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and [[Lusitania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 97&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus' future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman [[mining]] projects, especially the very rich [[gold]] deposits at [[Las Medulas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 97&quot; /&gt;

Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16&amp;nbsp;BC was another important victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 98&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument [[Trophy of Augustus]] near [[Monaco]] was built to honor the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 98 99&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 99&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the [[Elbe]] River by 9&amp;nbsp;BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 99&quot; /&gt; It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all the way back to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot; /&gt;

[[File:TabulaPeutingerianaMuziris.jpg|thumb|[[Muziris]] in the [[Chera Kingdom]] of [[Southern India]], as shown in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]], with depiction of a &quot;Temple of Augustus&quot; (&quot;Templum Augusti&quot;), an illustration of [[Indo-Roman relations]] in the period.]]

To protect Rome's eastern territories from the [[Parthian Empire]], Augustus relied on the [[client state]]s of the east to act as territorial [[Buffer state|buffers]] and areas that could raise their own troops for defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot; /&gt; Tiberius was responsible for restoring [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]] to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot; /&gt;

Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with [[Phraates IV of Parthia]] (37–2&amp;nbsp;BC) in 20&amp;nbsp;BC for the return of the [[Vexilloid|battle standards]] lost by [[Crassus]] in the [[Battle of Carrhae]], a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brosius (2006), 96–97, 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 95 96&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as [[propaganda]] symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] and in monuments such as the [[Forum of Augustus|Temple of Mars Ultor]] ('[[Mars (mythology)|Mars the Avenger]]') built to house the standards.&lt;ref&gt;Brosius (2006), 97; see also Bivar (1983), 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parthia had always posed a threat to Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot; /&gt; Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 13&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot; /&gt;

A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9, where three entire legions led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were destroyed by [[Arminius]], leader of the [[Cherusci]], an apparent Roman ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 101 102&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 417&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman general [[Germanicus]] took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and [[Segestes]]; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 31&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and succession ==

The illness of Augustus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot; /&gt; If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 114 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 44&quot; /&gt;

After the death of Marcellus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 44&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 58&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]

Augustus' intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 416–417.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the consulship in 5 and 2&amp;nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers,&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' daughter Julia&amp;nbsp;— as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Drusus' marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was &quot;only&quot; the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot; /&gt;

Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6&amp;nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46&quot; /&gt; as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus' apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius. (Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.)&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117 118&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46 47&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9&amp;nbsp;BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 119&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot; /&gt; In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ''imperium'' with that of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 119 120&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Great Cameo of France CdM Paris Bab264 white background.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The deified Augustus hovers over Tiberius and other Julio-Claudians in the [[Great Cameo of France]]]]

The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 49&quot; /&gt; He certainly fell out of Augustus' favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a &quot;vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 49&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.

On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting [[Nola]] where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ''Annals'' 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 55.22.2; 56.30&lt;/ref&gt; This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everitt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Agustus: The Life of rome's First Emperor|last=Everitt|first=Anthony|date=2006|pages=312–320|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7058-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 123&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everitt&quot;/&gt;

Augustus' famous last words were, &quot;Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit&quot;—referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, &quot;Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.&quot; An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus' body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 123&quot; /&gt; Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two ''[[rostra]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]]. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot; /&gt; The mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths in 410 during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]], and his ashes were scattered.

Historian D. C. A. Shotter states that Augustus' policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (1966), 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Shotter suggests that Augustus' deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius' &quot;extremely conservative&quot; attitude towards religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;shotter 211&quot;&gt;Shotter (1966), 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw-smith 213&quot; /&gt; Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on [[Gaius Asinius Gallus]] (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), as well as toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;shotter 211&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Augstus kameo.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The Augustus cameo at the center of the Medieval [[Cross of Lothair]]]]
Augustus' reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted, in one form or another, for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate [[decline of the Roman Empire|decline of the Western Roman Empire]] and until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]''. The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 1 2&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the &quot;queen of inscriptions&quot; by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 2&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived such as his poems ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus' ''Eulogy of Cato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 47&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw-smith 213&quot;&gt;Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourne (1918), 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to &quot;[[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]]&quot;. Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot; /&gt; The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot; /&gt;

A ''praefectus vigilum'', or &quot;Prefect of the Watch&quot; was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 345&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 345.&lt;/ref&gt; With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 85 86&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 86&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 81&quot; /&gt; Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 122&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 6&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27&amp;nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 341&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 341.&lt;/ref&gt; They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 341 342&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]].]]
Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot; /&gt; He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 28&amp;nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot; /&gt;

The longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot; /&gt; The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 120&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;&gt;Starr (1952), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56–c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot; /&gt; He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot; /&gt; Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:

[[File:0005MAN-OctAugusto.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD]]
{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war—and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used—merely to preserve peace for the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, I 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the second opposing opinion:
{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts. In actual fact, the motive of Octavian, the future Augustus, was lust for power&amp;nbsp;... There had certainly been peace, but it was a blood-stained peace of disasters and assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, I 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a recent biography on Augustus, [[Anthony Everitt]] asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus' reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:

{{quote|&quot;Opposites do not have to be mutually exclusive, and we are not obliged to choose one or the other. The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt]] (2006), 324–325.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]]
Tacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96–98) successfully &quot;mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 6&quot;&gt;Starr (1952), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot; /&gt; The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39–65) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC–46&amp;nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, &quot;perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 6&quot; /&gt;

The [[Anglo-Irish]] writer [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), in his ''Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome'', criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed [[Great Britain]]'s virtuous [[constitutional monarchy]] to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 118&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658–1741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658).&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 118&quot; /&gt; Thomas Gordon and the [[France|French]] political philosopher [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] (1689–1755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 119&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the [[Scotland|Scottish]] scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701–1757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian ruler]], &quot;a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper&quot;, &quot;wicked and worthless&quot;, &quot;a mean spirit&quot;, and a &quot;tyrant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 119&quot; /&gt;

=== Revenue reforms ===
[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. [[British Museum]]]]

Augustus' public [[revenue]] reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot; /&gt; This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot; /&gt; Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot; /&gt;

An equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the Republican era, and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot; /&gt; The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot; /&gt;

Rome's revenue was the amount of the successful bids, and the tax farmers' profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers, widely (and accurately) perceived as unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.

The use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144 145&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 145&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144&quot; /&gt; as well as [[bread and circuses]] for the population of Rome.

During his reign the [[Venatio|circus games]] resulted in the murder of 3,500 [[North African elephant|elephants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woolf2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=3%2C500+elephants|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Month of August ===
The month of August (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six is ''sex''). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building projects ===
{{Main|:Category:Augustan building projects}}
{{Further|Vitruvius|De architectura}}
[[File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace), 13&amp;nbsp;BC to 9 BC]]

On his deathbed, Augustus boasted &quot;I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble.&quot; Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 56.30.3&quot;&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/56*.html#30 56.30.3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marble]] could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot; /&gt;

Although this did not apply to the [[Subura]] slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the [[Campus Martius]], with the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central [[gnomon]] was an [[obelisks of Rome|obelisk]] taken from Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 122&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[relief]] sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the ''Res Gestae''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 32&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the [[praetor]]ians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 32&quot; /&gt;

He also built the [[Temple of Caesar]], the [[Baths of Agrippa]], and the [[Forum of Augustus]] with its [[Temple of Mars Ultor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html|title= The Deeds of the Divine Augustus
|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)|Theatre of Balbus]], and Agrippa's construction of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. [[Porticus Octaviae|Portico of Octavia]], [[Theatre of Marcellus]]). Even his [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] was built before his death to house members of his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 118 121&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 118–121&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|Arch of Augustus]] was built in 29&amp;nbsp;BC near the entrance of the [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]], and widened in 19&amp;nbsp;BC to include a triple-arch design.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot; /&gt; There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus' name and legacy, such as the [[Mérida, Spain|Theatre of Mérida]] in modern Spain, the [[Maison Carrée]] built at [[Nîmes]] in today's southern France, as well as the [[Trophy of Augustus]] at [[La Turbie]], located near [[Monaco]].

[[File:Vienne-RomanTemple2.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Augustus and Livia in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], late 1st century BC]]
After the death of Agrippa in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot; /&gt;

In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the ''curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum'' (translated as &quot;Supervisors of Public Property&quot;) was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot; /&gt; Augustus created the senatorial group of the ''curatores viarum'' (translated as &quot;Supervisors for Roads&quot;) for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 81&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corinthian order]] of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot; /&gt;

== Physical appearance and official images ==
His biographer Suetonius, writing about a century after Augustus' death, described his appearance as: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something&amp;nbsp;... He had clear, bright eyes&amp;nbsp;... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclining to [[blond|golden]]; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature (although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches, more or less 1.75 meter, in height), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him.&amp;nbsp;... &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#79 79], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe|J. C. Rolfe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His official images were very tightly controlled and idealized, drawing from a tradition of [[Hellenistic]] royal portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in [[Roman portraiture]]. He first appeared on [[Ancient Roman coinage|coins]] at the age of 19, and from about 29 BC &quot;the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil, religious, economic and military life with Augustus' person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walker and Burnett, pp. 1, 18, 25 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The early images did indeed depict a young man, but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies, by which time they had &quot;a distanced air of ageless majesty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 186&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known of many surviving portraits are the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]], the image on the Ara Pacis, and the [[Via Labicana Augustus]], which shows him as a priest. Several [[engraved gem|cameo portraits]] include the [[Blacas Cameo]] and ''[[Gemma Augustea]]''.

Born '''Tiberius Claudius Nero''', a [[Claudia (gens)|Claudian]], Tiberius was the son of [[Tiberius Nero|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] and [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]]. His mother divorced Nero and married [[Augustus|Octavian]], later known as Augustus, in 39 BC, making him a [[step-son]] of Octavian.

Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to [[Scribonia]]), [[Julia the Elder]], and even [[Adoption in ancient Rome|later be adopted]] by Augustus, by which act he officially became a [[Julia (gens)|Julian]], bearing the name '''Tiberius Julius Caesar'''. The subsequent emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. In relations to the other emperors of this dynasty, Tiberius was the stepson of [[Augustus]], grand-uncle of [[Caligula]], paternal uncle of [[Claudius]], and great-grand uncle of [[Nero]].

Tiberius was one of Rome's greatest [[general]]s; his conquest of [[Pannonia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Raetia]], and temporarily, parts of [[Germania]], laid the foundations for the northern frontier. But he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; [[Pliny the Elder]] called him ''tristissimus hominum,'' &quot;the gloomiest of men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/28*.html#v XXVIII.5.23]; Capes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_cwXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 p. 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Tiberius’ son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] in 23 AD, he became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD Tiberius removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous [[Praetorian Prefect]]s [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] and [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro]].

[[Caligula]], Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, succeeded Tiberius upon his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiberius&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tiberius |url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/tiberius.html |year=2006|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{See also|Julio-Claudian dynasty}}

=== Background ===
Tiberius was born in [[Rome]] on 16 November 42&amp;nbsp;BC to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] and [[Livia Drusilla]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; In 39&amp;nbsp;BC his mother [[divorce]]d his biological father and remarried [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]] shortly thereafter, while still pregnant with Tiberius Nero's son. In 38&amp;nbsp;BC his brother, [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]] pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is recorded of Tiberius's early life. In 32&amp;nbsp;BC Tiberius made his first public appearance at the age of nine, delivering the [[eulogy]] for his biological father.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-6&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; In 29&amp;nbsp;BC, both he and his brother Drusus rode in the triumphal chariot along with their adoptive father Octavian in celebration of the [[Battle of Actium|defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-6&quot; /&gt;

In 23&amp;nbsp;BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his possible death threatened to plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Southern|Southern]], pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24&amp;nbsp;BC at the age of seventeen Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of [[quaestor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;paterculus-roman-history-ii-94&quot;&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#94 II.94]&lt;/ref&gt; and was granted the right to stand for election as [[praetor]] and [[consul]] five years in advance of the age required by law.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-9&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#9 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provisions were made for Drusus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager|Seager]], p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil and military career ===
Shortly thereafter Tiberius began appearing in court as an [[advocate]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#8 8]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is presumably here that his interest in Greek [[rhetoric]] began. In 20&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was sent East under [[Marcus Agrippa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parthians]] had captured the standards of the [[Roman legion|legions]] under the command of [[Marcus Crassus|Marcus Licinius Crassus]] (53&amp;nbsp;BC) (at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]), Decidius Saxa (40&amp;nbsp;BC), and [[Marc Antony]] (36&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-9&quot; /&gt;

After a year of negotiation, Tiberius led a sizable force into [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], presumably with the goal of establishing it as a Roman client-state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border. Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby the standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-9&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Vipsania.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of [[Vipsania Agrippina]], Tiberius' first wife, recovered from [[Leptis Magna]].]]
After returning from the East in 19&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was married to [[Vipsania Agrippina]], the daughter of Augustus’s close friend and greatest general, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-7&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the position of [[praetor]], and sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the [[Alps]] and within [[Transalpine Gaul]], [[Conquest of the Alps|conquering Raetia]]. In 15&amp;nbsp;BC he discovered the sources of the [[Danube]], and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 7. I. 5, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Rome in 13&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was appointed as consul, and around this same time his son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], pp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippa's death in 12&amp;nbsp;BC elevated Tiberius and Drusus with respect to the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married [[Julia the Elder]], Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiberius&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-7&quot; /&gt; This event seems to have been the breaking point for Tiberius; his new marriage with Julia was never a happy one, and produced only a single child who died in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-7&quot; /&gt;

Reportedly, Tiberius once ran into Vipsania again, and proceeded to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-7&quot; /&gt; soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9&amp;nbsp;BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12&amp;nbsp;BC he received military commissions in [[Pannonia]] and [[Germania]]; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.

[[File:Germania Enobarbo e Tiberio.jpg|thumb|350px|The campaigns of Tiberius, [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC)|Ahenobarbus]], and [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus|Saturninus]] in [[Germania]] between 6 BC and 1 BC.]]
In 6 BC, Tiberius launched a [[pincer movement]] against the [[Marcomanni]]. Setting out northwest from [[Carnuntum]] on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through [[Quadi]] territory in order to invade the Marcomanni from the east. Meanwhile, general [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus]] would depart east from [[Moguntiacum]] on the Rhine with two or three legions, pass through newly annexed [[Hermunduri]] territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.

He returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in 7&amp;nbsp;BC, and in 6&amp;nbsp;BC was granted [[tribune|tribunician power]] ''(tribunicia potestas)'' and control in the East,&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#9 LV.9]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retirement to Rhodes (6 BC) ===
[[File:SperlongaVillaTiberio.jpg|thumb|250px|Remnants of Tiberius' villa at [[Sperlonga]], on the coast midway between Rome and Naples]]
In 6&amp;nbsp;BC, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 23—24.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberius's move thus seemed to be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, behavior of his unhappily married wife, Julia,&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#100 II.100]&lt;/ref&gt; may have also played a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9&quot; /&gt; Indeed, [[Tacitus]] calls it Tiberius' ''intima causa'', his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#53|I.53]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.&lt;ref name=sag26 /&gt;

Whatever Tiberius's motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of ''[[princeps]]'' survive.&lt;ref name=sag26&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;sag26&quot; /&gt; Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#11 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heir to Augustus ===
With Tiberius's departure, succession rested solely on Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD&amp;nbsp;2 with the death of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD&amp;nbsp;4, Gaius was killed in [[Armenia]], and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-i-3&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope1&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#15 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Gaius in AD&amp;nbsp;4 initiated a flurry of activity in the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir and in turn, he was required to adopt his nephew, [[Germanicus]], the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece [[Antonia Minor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-i-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#13 LV.13]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus's ''maius imperium'', something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#21 21]. For the debate over whether Agrippa's ''imperium'' after 13&amp;nbsp;BC was ''maius'' or ''aequum'', see, e.g., {{cite journal |author=E. Badian |date=December 1980 – January 1981 |title=Notes on the ''Laudatio'' of Agrippa |journal=Classical Journal |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=97–109, pp. 105–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD&amp;nbsp;7, [[Agrippa Postumus]], a younger brother of Gaius and Lucius, was disowned by Augustus and banished to the island of [[Pianosa]], to live in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#32 LV.32]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when in AD&amp;nbsp;13, the powers held by Tiberius were made equal, rather than second, to Augustus's own powers, he was for all intents and purposes a &quot;co-princeps&quot; with Augustus, and in the event of the latter's passing, would simply continue to rule without an [[interregnum]] or possible upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager|Seager]] p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to [[Suetonius]], after a two-year stint in [[Germania]], which lasted from 10−12 AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Speidel, Michael Riding for Caesar:The Roman Emperorors’ Horse guards19&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Tiberius' returned and celebrated the triumph which he had postponed, accompanied also by his generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia. And before turning to enter the Capitol, he dismounted from his chariot and fell at the knees of his father, who was presiding over the ceremonies.”&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#20 20]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Since the consuls caused a law to be passed soon after this that he should govern the provinces jointly with Augustus and hold the census with him, he set out for Illyricum on the conclusion of the lustral ceremonies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus according to Suetonius, these ceremonies and the declaration of his &quot;co-princeps&quot; took place in the year 12 AD, after Tiberius return from Germania.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; &quot;But he was at once recalled, and finding Augustus in his last illness but still alive, he spent an entire day with him in private.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot; /&gt; Augustus died in AD&amp;nbsp;14, at the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;Velleieus Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#123 II.123]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried with all due ceremony and, as had been arranged beforehand, [[apotheosis|deified]], his will read, and Tiberius confirmed as his sole surviving heir.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#8|I.8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emperor (14–37 AD) ==

=== Early reign ===
[[File:Aureus à l'effigie de Tibère.jpg|thumb|Tiberius]]
The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] convened on 18 September, to validate Tiberius's position as [[Princeps]] and, as it had done with Augustus before, extend the powers of the position to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], pp. 68—81.&lt;/ref&gt; These proceedings are fully accounted by [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1|I.9–11]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius already had the administrative and political powers of the Princeps, all he lacked were the titles—Augustus, [[Pater Patriae]], and the [[Civic Crown]] (a crown made from [[bay laurel|laurel]] and [[oak]], in honor of Augustus having saved the lives of Roman citizens).

Tiberius, however, attempted to play the same role as Augustus: that of the reluctant public servant who wants nothing more than to serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 44—45.&lt;/ref&gt; This ended up throwing the entire affair into confusion, and rather than humble, he came across as derisive; rather than seeming to want to serve the state, he seemed obstructive.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#24 24]&lt;/ref&gt; He cited his age as a reason why he could not act as Princeps, stated he did not wish the position, and then proceeded to ask for only a section of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#12|I.12]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#13|I.13]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius finally relented and accepted the powers voted to him, though according to Tacitus and Suetonius he refused to bear the titles [[Pater Patriae]], Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem of the Princeps, the Civic Crown and laurels.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#26 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

This meeting seems to have set the tone for Tiberius's entire rule. He seems to have wished for the Senate and the state to simply act without him and his direct orders were rather vague, inspiring debate more on what he actually meant than on passing his legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#32|III.32]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#52|III.52]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his first few years, Tiberius seemed to have wanted the Senate to act on its own,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#35|III.35]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#53|III.53]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#54|III.54]]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as a servant to his will as it had been under Augustus. According to Tacitus, Tiberius derided the Senate as &quot;men fit to be slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#65|III.65]]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

=== Rise and fall of Germanicus ===
[[File:Germanicus.jpg|thumb|200px|A bust of the adopted son of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], from the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].]]

Problems arose quickly for the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in [[Pannonia]] and in [[Germania]] had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after a short period of time mutinied when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#16|I.16]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#17|I.17]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#31|I.31]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanicus]] and Tiberius's son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.&lt;ref name=&quot;LVII.6&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#6 LVII.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.&lt;ref name=&quot;LVII.6&quot;/&gt; Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the [[Elbe]]. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the [[Teutoburg forest]] and the reclaiming of Roman [[aquila (Roman)|standards]] lost years before by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-ii-41&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#41|II.41]]&lt;/ref&gt; when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|had been ambushed]] by Germanic tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-ii-41&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#46|II.46]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanicus had managed to deal a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome, actions that increased the fame and legend of the already very popular Germanicus with the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter, 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being recalled from Germania,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#26|II.26]]&lt;/ref&gt; Germanicus celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome in AD&amp;nbsp;17,&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-ii-41&quot; /&gt; the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29&amp;nbsp;BC. As a result, in AD&amp;nbsp;18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#43|II.43]]&lt;/ref&gt; Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria]], of poisoning him.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#71|II.71]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#16|III.16]]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps to the death of Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#52 52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#15|III.15]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberius seems to have tired of politics at this point. In AD&amp;nbsp;22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#56|III.56]]&lt;/ref&gt; and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD&amp;nbsp;23, Drusus mysteriously died,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#7|IV.7]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#8|IV.8]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62]&lt;/ref&gt; and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD&amp;nbsp;26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of [[Capri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-67&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#67|IV.67]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tiberius in Capri, with Sejanus in Rome ===
&lt;!-- [[File:TiberiusAureus.jpg|left|thumb|330px|Roman [[aureus]] struck in AD&amp;nbsp;36, depicting Tiberius, with Livia as [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]] shown on the reverse.]]
 --&gt;[[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became [[Praetorian Prefect]] in AD&amp;nbsp;15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD&amp;nbsp;17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed the ranks of the [[Praetorian Guard]] responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls [[Castra Praetoria|into the city itself]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-37&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#37 37]&lt;/ref&gt; giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.

The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus, at least in Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#2|IV.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#21 LVII.21]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD&amp;nbsp;26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-67&quot; /&gt;

Sejanus's position was not quite that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD&amp;nbsp;25 to Tiberius's niece, [[Livilla]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#39|IV.39]]&lt;/ref&gt; though under pressure quickly withdrew the request.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#41|IV.41]]&lt;/ref&gt; While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#41|IV.41]]&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of [[Livia]] seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD&amp;nbsp;29 changed all that.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#3|V.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians in the city of Rome, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Germanicus's widow [[Agrippina the Elder]] and two of her sons, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero Caesar]] and [[Drusus Caesar]] were arrested and exiled in AD&amp;nbsp;30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances. In Sejanus's purge of Agrippina the Elder and her family, [[Caligula]], [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]], and [[Julia Livilla]] were the only survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#53 53], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#54 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Jovis (Restauriert).jpg|thumb|230px|Ruins from the [[Villa Jovis]] on the island of [[Capri]], where Tiberius spent much of his final years, leaving control of the empire in the hands of the prefect [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].]]

In 31, Sejanus held the consulship with Tiberius ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]],''&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-65&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#65 65]&lt;/ref&gt; and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what happened is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of Princeps, or as a possible regent.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-65&quot; /&gt; [[Livilla]] was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#22 LVII.22]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot seems to have involved the two of them overthrowing Tiberius, with the support of the Julians, and either assuming the [[Principate]] themselves, or serving as regent to the young [[Tiberius Gemellus]] or possibly even [[Gaius Caligula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boddington-sejanus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Boddington |first = Ann |title = Sejanus. Whose Conspiracy? |journal = The American Journal of Philology |volume = 84 |issue = 1 |pages = 1–16 |date = January 1963 |doi = 10.2307/293155 |jstor = 293155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and swiftly dealt with.&lt;ref name=&quot;boddington-sejanus&quot; /&gt;

In AD&amp;nbsp;31 Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lviii-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#10 LVIII.10]&lt;/ref&gt; As commander of the Praetorian Guard, he was replaced by [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lviii-10&quot; /&gt;

Tacitus claims that more treason trials followed and that whereas Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the outset of his reign, now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. Hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was hit, as any and all who had associated with Sejanus or could in some way be tied to his schemes were summarily tried and executed, their properties seized by the state.  As Tacitus vividly describes,

{{quote|Executions were now a stimulus to his fury, and he ordered the death of all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with Sejanus. There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed to be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-19&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#19|VI.19]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Tacitus' portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians. The prominent ancient historian [[Edward Togo Salmon]] notes in his work, ''A history of the Roman world from 30 BC to AD 138'': {{quote|&quot;In the whole twenty two years of Tiberius' reign, not more than fifty-two persons were accused of treason, of whom almost half escaped conviction, while the four innocent people to be condemned fell victims to the excessive zeal of the Senate, not to the Emperor's tyranny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Roman world from 30 BC to AD 138, Page 183, Edward Togo Salmon&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. [[Suetonius]] records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, including graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty,&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-43&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#43 43], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#44 44], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#45 45]&lt;/ref&gt; and most of all his paranoia.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-60&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#60 60], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#63 63], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#64 64]&lt;/ref&gt; While heavily sensationalized,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, Andrew (1984) ''Suetonius: The Scholar and His Caesars'', Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-03000-2&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius' stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.

=== Final years ===

The affair with Sejanus and the final years of treason trials permanently damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became [[paranoia|paranoid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-60&quot; /&gt; and spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from [[Dacia]] and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#41 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was done to either secure or indicate how his [[Order of succession|succession]] was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either [[Caligula]], the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or his own grandson, [[Tiberius Gemellus]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#46|VI.46]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a half-hearted attempt at the end of Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a [[quaestor]], and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#23 LVII.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Death (37 AD) ====
Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 15 March AD&amp;nbsp;37, at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-51&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus records that upon the news of his death the crowd rejoiced, only to become suddenly silent upon hearing that he had recovered, and rejoiced again at the news that Caligula and Macro had smothered him.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not recorded by other ancient historians and is most likely apocryphal, but some historians consider it indicative of how the senatorial class felt towards the Emperor at the time of his death. After his death, the Senate refused to vote him divine honors, and mobs filled the streets yelling &quot;To the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] with Tiberius!&quot;—in reference to a method of disposal reserved for the corpses of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Death of Tiberius: Tacitus ''Annals'' 6.50; Dio 58.28.1–4; Suetinus ''Tiberius'' 73, ''Gaius'' 12.2–3; Josephus ''AJ'' 18.225. Posthumous insults: Suetinus ''Tiberius'' 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the body of the emperor was cremated and his ashes were quietly laid in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], later to be scattered in &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 410 during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Mausoleum_Augusti.html |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |last1= Platner |first1=Samuel Ball |last2= Ashby |first2=Thomas |year=1929 |chapter=Mausoleum Augusti |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=332–336 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[will (law)|will]], Tiberius had left his powers jointly to Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#76 76]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lix-1&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#1 LIX.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula's first act on becoming Princeps was to void Tiberius' will and have Gemellus executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lix-1&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;!--
It could be argued that Tiberius’s downfall was not his abuse of power but his refusal to use it. His withdrawn nature, especially in comparison with Augustus's openness, immediately made him a disliked figure. The Senate had been functioning under the directorship of the Principate for almost 50 years; most Senators had gained their position and hoped to advance further by courting Imperial favor. Tiberius's attempt to restore some share of administration to the Senate thus met with failure; the Senate no longer knew how to rule independent of the Princeps. Despite his excellence as a military commander and his long experience in affairs of state, Tiberius seemed uninterested in the role of Emperor, and his rule and his reputation suffered. The administration of the Imperial sector of the government increased during this time, but how much this is due to direct action by Tiberius rather than his freedmen advisers cannot be determined. In the end, Tiberius perhaps is a model of how power can be abused by its lack of use.--&gt;

Tiberius' heir Caligula not only spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] but would also begin the chain of events which would bring about the downfall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 68.&lt;ref&gt;Caligula would kill [[Tiberius Gemellus]] and [[Antonia Minor]] before being killed by his own personal guard. Tiberius' nephew [[Claudius]] succeeded Caligula and executed Caligula's sister [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Livilla]] and in turn would be murdered by Livilla's sister [[Agrippina the Younger]] after they married and her son was of an age to become emperor. Agrippina would be executed by her son [[Nero]], who would later commit suicide in 68 AD with no heirs to succeed him. Only Caligula's sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] died of natural causes.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Historiography ===
[[File:TiberiusLouvre.jpg|thumb|Photograph of a bust of Tiberius, housed in the [[Louvre]].]]

Were he to have died prior to AD&amp;nbsp;23, he might have been hailed as an exemplary ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-6&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#6|IV.6]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the overwhelmingly negative characterization left by Roman [[historians]], Tiberius left the imperial [[treasury]] with nearly 3 billion [[sesterces]] upon his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lix-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using [[diplomacy]] as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-37&quot; /&gt;

The result was a stronger, more consolidated empire. Of the authors whose texts have survived, only four describe the reign of Tiberius in considerable detail: [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Velleius Paterculus]]. Fragmentary evidence also remains from [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Strabo]] and [[Seneca the Elder]]. Tiberius himself wrote an autobiography which Suetonius describes as &quot;brief and sketchy,&quot; but this book has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#61 61]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Publius Cornelius Tacitus ====

{{See also|Tacitus}}

The most detailed account of this period is handed down to us by [[Tacitus]], whose ''[[Annals]]'' dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of [[Nero]] in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] (all of which are lost).&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-6&quot; /&gt;

Tacitus' narrative emphasizes both political and psychological motivation. The characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of [[Drusus]] in 23 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-6&quot; /&gt;

The rule of Julio-Claudians is generally described as unjust and 'criminal' by Tacitus.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#6|I.6]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the outset of his reign, he seems to ascribe many of Tiberius' virtues merely to hypocrisy.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-51&quot; /&gt;
Another major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the Emperors, [[political corruption|corruption]], and the growing [[tyranny]] among the governing classes of Rome. A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the ''maiestas'' law under Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#72|I.72]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#74|I.74]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#27|II.27–32]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#49|III.49–51]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#66|III.66–69]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Tacitus' opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:

{{quote|His character too had its distinct periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive. Again, while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared Sejanus. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-51&quot; /&gt;}}

==== Suetonius Tranquillus ====
[[File:Silver denarius of Tiberius 14CE 37CE found in India Indian copy of a the same 1st century CE Coin of Kushan king Kujula Kadphises copying a coin of Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of [[Indo-Roman trade and relations]] during the period: silver denarius of Tiberius (14–37) found in [[India]] and Indian copy of the same, 1st-century coin of [[Kushan]] king [[Kujula Kadphises]] copying a coin of [[Augustus]].]]
[[Suetonius]] was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]]. ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' details a biographical history of the principate from the birth of [[Julius Caesar]] to the death of [[Domitian]] in AD&amp;nbsp;96. Like Tacitus, he drew upon the imperial archives, as well as histories by [[Aufidius Bassus]], [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Augustus' own letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-43&quot; /&gt;

His account is more sensationalist and anecdotal than that of his contemporary. The most famous sections of his biography delve into the numerous alleged debaucheries Tiberius remitted himself to while at Capri.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-43&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Suetonius also reserves praise for Tiberius' actions during his early reign, emphasizing his modesty.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#26 26–32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Velleius Paterculus ====
One of the few surviving sources contemporary with the rule of Tiberius comes from [[Velleius Paterculus]], who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD&amp;nbsp;4) in Germany and Pannonia as [[praefect]] of cavalry and ''legatus''. Paterculus' ''Compendium of Roman History'' spans a period from the fall of [[Troy]] to the death of Livia in AD&amp;nbsp;29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor&lt;ref name=&quot;paterculus-roman-history-ii-94&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#103 II.103–105], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#129 II.129–130]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sejanus.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#127 II.127–128]&lt;/ref&gt; How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD&amp;nbsp;31 as a friend of Sejanus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Syme |first = Ronald |title = Seianus on the Aventine |journal = Hermes |volume = 84 |issue = 3 |pages = 257–266 |year = 1956 |publisher = Franz Steiner Verlag |jstor = 4474933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gospels, Jews, and Christians ===
[[File:Emperor Tiberius Denarius - Tribute Penny.jpg|thumb|The ''[[tribute penny]]'' mentioned in the Bible is commonly believed to be a Roman [[denarius]] depicting the Emperor Tiberius.]]
The [[Gospel]]s mention that during Tiberius' reign, [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] preached and was executed under the authority of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judaea province]]. In the [[Bible]], Tiberius is mentioned by name only once, in ''Luke 3:1'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Luke|3:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that [[John the Baptist]] entered on his public ministry in the fifteenth year of his reign. Many references to ''Caesar'' (or ''the emperor'' in some other translations), without further specification, would seem to refer to Tiberius. Similarly, the &quot;[[Tribute Penny]]&quot; referred to in Matthew&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|22:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Mark|12:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is popularly thought to be a [[silver]] [[denarius]] coin of Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During Tiberius' reign Jews had become more prominent in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began [[proselytizing]] Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jossa|first=Giorgio|title=Jews or Christians|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZlBXVPnGxVkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+or+Christians#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20or%20Christians%3F&amp;f=false|year=2006|pages=123–126|isbn=3-16-149192-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age to join the Roman Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt; Tiberius banished the rest of the Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt;

There is considerable debate among historians as to when [[Christianity]] was differentiated from [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt; According to [[Tertullian]], a Roman lawyer who had access to the archives of the Empire, Tiberius had requested the Senate, a few years after Jesus' crucifixion, to publicly recognize Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt;  Most scholars believe that Roman distinction between Jews and Christians took place around 70 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt;  Tiberius most likely viewed Christians as a Jewish sect rather than a separate, distinct faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jossa&quot; /&gt;

=== Archaeology ===
The palace of Tiberius at Rome was located on the [[Palatine Hill]], the ruins of which can still be seen today. No major public works were undertaken in the city during his reign, except a temple dedicated to Augustus and the restoration of the [[theater of Pompey]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#45|IV.45]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#72|III.72]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#47 47]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were not finished until the reign of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, remnants of Tiberius' villa at [[Sperlonga]], which includes a [[grotto]] where the important [[Sperlonga sculptures]] were found in fragments, and the ''[[Villa Jovis]]'' on top of [[Capri]] have been preserved. The estate at Capri is said by Tacitus to have included a total of twelve villas across the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-67&quot; /&gt; of which ''Villa Jovis'' was the largest.

Tiberius refused to be worshipped as a living god, and allowed only one temple to be built in his honor at [[Smyrna]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#37|IV.37–38]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#55|IV.55–56]]&lt;/ref&gt; The town [[Tiberias]], in modern [[Israel]] on the western shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]] was named in Tiberius's honour by [[Herod Antipas]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 2|XVIII.2.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In fiction ===
Tiberius has been represented in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, often as a peripheral character in the central storyline. One such modern representation is in the novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'' by [[Robert Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booktalk.org/i-claudius.php |title=''I, Claudius'': From the Autobiography of Tiberius Claudius – Robert Graves|publisher=Booktalk.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618094451/http://www.booktalk.org/i-claudius.php |archivedate = 18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequent [[BBC]] [[I, Claudius (TV series)|television series]] adaptation, where he is portrayed by [[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/iclaudius.shtml |title=BBC Four Drama – ''I, Claudius'' |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1968 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] historical drama ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]'', Tiberius (by [[André Morell]]) is the central character for much of the series and is portrayed in a much more balanced way than in ''I, Claudius''.

He also appears as a minor character in the 2006 film [[The Inquiry (2006 film)|''The Inquiry'']], in which he is played by [[Max von Sydow]]. In addition, Tiberius has prominent roles in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (played by [[George Relph]] in his last starring role),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017920/ |title=Emperor Tiberius Caesar (Character) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[A.D. (miniseries)|A.D.]]'' (played by [[James Mason]]).

Played by [[Ernest Thesiger]], he featured in ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953). He was featured in the 1979 film [[Caligula (film)|''Caligula'']], portrayed by [[Peter O'Toole]]. He was an important character in [[Taylor Caldwell]]'s 1958 novel, ''[[Dear and Glorious Physician]]'', a biography of St [[Luke the Evangelist]], author of the third canonical Gospel.

== Children and family ==
Tiberius was married two times, with only his first union producing a child who would survive to adulthood:
* [[Vipsania Agrippina]], daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] (16–11 BC)
** [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] (13 BC – 23 AD)
* [[Julia the Elder]], only daughter of [[Augustus]] (11–6 BC)

'''Caligula''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|g|j|ə|l|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of the names of Caligula:
#{{sqc|GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs gɛr'maː.nɪ.kʊs|IPA}}
#{{sqc|CALIGVLA}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|ka'lɪ.gʊ.ɫa|IPA}} or {{IPA|[.la]|}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the popular nickname of '''Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''' (31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41), [[Roman emperor]] (AD 37–41). Born '''Gaius Julius Caesar''' (not to be confused with Gaius [[Julius Caesar]]), Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Caligula's father [[Germanicus]], the nephew and [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son of Emperor [[Tiberius]], was a very successful general and one of Rome's most beloved public figures. The young Gaius earned the nickname &quot;Caligula&quot; (meaning &quot;little soldier's boot&quot;, the diminutive form of ''[[Caligae|caliga]]'', hob-nailed military boot) from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in [[Germania]].

When Germanicus died at [[Antioch]] in AD 19, his wife [[Agrippina the Elder]] returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted the invitation to join the Emperor in AD 31 on the island of [[Capri]], where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. With the death of Tiberius in AD 37, Caligula succeeded his [[great uncle|grand uncle]] and adoptive grandfather as emperor.

There are few surviving sources about the reign of Emperor Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first six months of his reign. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane [[tyrant]]. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the [[principate]]. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] in Rome: the [[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Anio Novus]]. During his reign, the empire annexed the [[Mauretania|Kingdom of Mauretania]] as a [[Roman Mauretania|province]].

In early AD 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Roman Senate|senators]], and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the [[Roman Republic]] was thwarted: on the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]], the next Roman emperor.

==Early life==

===Family===
{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
:''See [[Julio-Claudian family tree]].''
Gaius Julius Caesar (named in honor of his [[Julius Caesar|famous relative]]) was born in [[Antium]] (modern [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]]&lt;ref&gt;Paola Brandizzi Vittucci, ''Antium: Anzio e Nettuno in epoca romana'', Roma, Bardi, 2000 ISBN 88-85699-83-9&lt;/ref&gt;) on 31 August 12 AD, the third of six surviving children born to [[Germanicus]] and his second cousin [[Agrippina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#7 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Gaius had two older brothers, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; as well as three younger sisters, [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Julia Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; He was also a nephew of [[Claudius]], Germanicus' younger brother and future emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-calig-6&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#6 LIX.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; She was a granddaughter of [[Augustus]] and [[Scribonia]] on her mother's side. Through Agrippina, Augustus was the maternal great-grandfather of Gaius.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt;

===Youth and early career===
[[File:Caligae from side.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Caligae|caliga]]''.]]
[[File:Cropped color calligula.jpg|thumb|A marble bust of Caligula restored to its original colours. The colours were identified from particles trapped in the marble.]]
[[File:Head Drusilla Glyptothek Munich 316.jpg|thumb|[[Julia Drusilla]], sister of Caligula]]
As a boy of just two or three, Gaius accompanied his father, [[Germanicus]], on campaigns in the north of [[Germania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-9&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#9 9].&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier's outfit, including boots and armour.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-9&quot;/&gt; He was soon given his nickname ''Caligula'', meaning &quot;little (soldier's) boot&quot; in Latin, after the small boots he wore.&lt;ref name=&quot;caligula-name&quot;&gt;&quot;Caligula&quot; is formed from the Latin word ''caliga'', meaning soldier's boot, and the [[diminutive]] [[infix]] ''-ul''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname.&lt;ref name=&quot;seneca-calig-18&quot;&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of a Wise Person'' XVIII 2–5. See Malloch, 'Gaius and the nobiles', Athenaeum (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]] claims that Germanicus was poisoned in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] by an agent of [[Tiberius]], who viewed Germanicus as a political rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until her relations with Tiberius deteriorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#10 10].&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-4-52&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#52|IV.52]].&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina and Caligula's brother, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]], were banished in 29 AD on charges of treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-5-3&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#3|V.3]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-54&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#54 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

The adolescent Caligula was then sent to live with his great-grandmother (and Tiberius's mother) [[Livia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; After her death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; In 30 AD, his brother, [[Drusus Caesar]], was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-54&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-5-10&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#10|V.10]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-64&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#64 64].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 31 AD, Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius on [[Capri]], where he lived for six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; To the surprise of many, Caligula was spared by Tiberius.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-62&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62].&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians, Caligula was an excellent natural actor and, recognizing danger, hid all his resentment towards Tiberius.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-20&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#20|VI.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; An observer said of Caligula, &quot;Never was there a better servant or a worse master!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-20&quot;/&gt;

Caligula claimed to have planned to kill Tiberius with a [[dagger]] in order to avenge his mother and brother: however, having brought the weapon into Tiberius's bedroom he did not kill the Emperor but instead threw the dagger down on the floor. Supposedly Tiberius knew of this but never dared to do anything about it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#12 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius claims that Caligula was already cruel and vicious: he writes that, when Tiberius brought Caligula to Capri, his purpose was to allow Caligula to live in order that he &quot;...&amp;nbsp;prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#11 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 33 AD, Tiberius gave Caligula an honorary [[quaestor]]ship, a position he held until his rise to emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-57-23&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#23 LVII.23].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, both Caligula's mother and his brother Drusus died in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-6-25&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#25|VI.25]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-6-23&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#23|VI.23]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla, in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect, [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], an important ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot; /&gt; Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-6&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#VI|VI.35]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 35 AD, Caligula was named joint heir to Tiberius's estate along with [[Tiberius Gemellus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-76&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor==

===Early reign===
When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, his estate and the titles of the [[principate]] were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]], who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 78 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still conjecture that he was murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-calig-50&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] writes that the [[Praetorian Prefect]], [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to the joy of the Roman people,&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-calig-50&quot;/&gt; while [[Suetonius]] writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;/&gt; Seneca the elder and [[Philo]], who both wrote during Tiberius's reign, as well as [[Josephus]] record Tiberius as dying a natural death.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#IV|IV.25]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII.6.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius's will nullified with regards to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius's wishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#1 LIX.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula accepted the powers of the principate as conferred by the [[Roman Senate|senate]] and entered Rome on 28 March amid a crowd that hailed him as &quot;our baby&quot; and &quot;our star&quot;, among other nicknames.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-13&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#13 13].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula is described as the first emperor who was admired by everyone in &quot;all the world, from the rising to the setting sun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-10&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.10]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular [[Germanicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-13&quot; /&gt; and because he was not [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#75 75].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius said that over 160,000 animals were sacrificed during three months of public rejoicing to usher in the new reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-14&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#14 14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-11&quot;&gt;Philo mentions widespread sacrifice, but no estimation on the degree, Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.12]].&lt;/ref&gt; Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula's reign as completely blissful.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-13&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.13]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula's first acts were said to be generous in spirit, though many were political in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot; /&gt; To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the [[Praetorian Guard]], city troops and the army outside Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot; /&gt; He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that [[treason]] trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-15&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#15 15].&lt;/ref&gt; He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial [[tax]] system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-16&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16 16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-18&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#18 18].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, or perhaps was poisoned. He soon recovered from his illness, but many believed that the illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness reminded him of his mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place.&lt;ref&gt;Dunstan, William E., ''Ancient Rome'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2010, ISBN 0-7425-6834-2, p.285.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his cousin and adopted son [[Tiberius Gemellus]] executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother [[Antonia Minor]]. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 15)|Marcus Junius Silanus]] and his brother-in-law [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]] executed as well. His uncle [[Claudius]] was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favorite sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]], were exiled. He hated being the grandson of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reform===
In AD 38, Caligula focused his attention on political and public reform. He published the accounts of public funds, which had not been made public during the reign of Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes, and gave out prizes to the public at gymnastic events. He allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-9-and-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9 LIX.9–10].&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, he restored the practice of democratic elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-16-2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16.2 16.2].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] said that this act &quot;though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many&amp;nbsp;... many disasters would result&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-9-7&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9.7 LIX.9.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, though, Caligula was criticized for executing people without full trials and for forcing his supporter Macro to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#10 LIX.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial crisis and famine===
According to [[Cassius Dio]], a financial crisis emerged in AD 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-10&quot; /&gt; [[Suetonius]] places the beginning of this crisis in 38.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#38 38].&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians describe a number of Caligula's other desperate measures. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money.&lt;ref name = &quot;gjxxsj&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#41 41].&lt;/ref&gt; He levied taxes on lawsuits, weddings and prostitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-40&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#40 40].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula began auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14].&lt;/ref&gt; Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#15 LIX.15].&lt;/ref&gt; Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to turn over spoils to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot; /&gt;

The current and past highway commissioners were accused of incompetence and embezzlement and forced to repay money.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot; /&gt; According to Suetonius, in the first year of Caligula's reign he squandered 2.7 billion [[Sestertius|sesterces]] that Tiberius had amassed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37]&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew [[Nero|Nero Caesar]] both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#30 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:vatican obelisk.jpg|thumb|The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was first brought from Egypt to Rome by Caligula. It was the centerpiece of a large racetrack he built.]]
A brief famine of unknown extent occurred, perhaps caused by this financial crisis, but Suetonius claims it resulted from Caligula's seizure of public carriages;&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;/&gt; according to Seneca, grain imports were disturbed because Caligula repurposed grain boats for a pontoon bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' XVIII.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
{{See also|Caligula's Giant Ship}}
Despite financial difficulties, Caligula embarked on a number of construction projects during his reign. Some were for the public good, though others were for himself.

[[Josephus]] describes Caligula's improvements to the harbours at [[Rhegium]] and [[Sicily]], allowing increased grain imports from Egypt, as his greatest contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; These improvements may have been in response to the famine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Caligula completed the [[Temple of Divus Augustus|temple of Augustus]] and the [[theatre of Pompey]] and began an [[Amphitheater of Caligula|amphitheatre]] beside the Saepta.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#21 21].&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#22 22].&lt;/ref&gt; He began the aqueducts [[Aqua Claudia]] and [[Anio Novus]], which [[Pliny the Elder]] considered engineering marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#21 21], Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#20 20]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXVI.122.&lt;/ref&gt; He built a large racetrack known as the ''circus of Gaius and Nero'' and had an Egyptian obelisk (now known as the &quot;[[Vatican Obelisk]]&quot;) transported by sea and erected in the middle of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XVI.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], he repaired the city walls and the temples of the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt; He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.15; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#37 37].&lt;/ref&gt; He had planned to rebuild the palace of [[Polycrates]] at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at [[Ephesus]] and to found a city high up in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt; He planned to dig a canal through the isthmus in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Nemi Ship Hull 1930.jpg|thumb|right|The hull of one of [[Nemi ships|two ships]] recovered from [[Lake Nemi]] during the 1930s. This massive vessel served as an elaborate floating palace to the Emperor.]]
In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary [[Pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] to be built using ships as [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]], stretching for over two miles from the resort of [[Baiae]] to the neighboring port of [[Puteoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#19 19].&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the bridge was to rival that of the Persian king, Xerxes, crossing of the Hellespont.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt; Caligula, who could not swim,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#54 54].&lt;/ref&gt; then proceeded to ride his favorite horse, [[Incitatus]], across, wearing the breastplate of [[Alexander the Great#Fate after death|Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt; This act was in defiance of a prediction by Tiberius's soothsayer [[Thrasyllus of Mendes]] that Caligula had &quot;no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt;

Caligula had [[Nemi ships|two large ships]] constructed for himself, which were recovered from the bottom of [[Lake Nemi]] during the dictatorship of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The ships were among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors and plumbing. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the Second World War, and almost nothing remains of their hulls, though many archeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the [[National Roman Museum|Museo Nazionale Romano]] (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.

===Feud with the senate===
In AD 39, relations between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.16; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of their disagreement is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. The Senate had become accustomed to ruling without an emperor between the departure of [[Tiberius]] for Capri in AD 26 and Caligula's accession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus, Annals IV.41&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' IV.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as [[Gaius Asinius Gallus|Asinius Gallus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus, Annals IV.41&quot;/&gt;

Caligula reviewed Tiberius's records of treason trials and decided, based on their actions during these trials, that numerous senators were not trustworthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;/&gt; He ordered a new set of investigations and trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;/&gt; He replaced the consul and had several senators put to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] reports that other senators were degraded by being forced to wait on him and run beside his chariot.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot;/&gt;

Soon after his break with the Senate, Caligula faced a number of additional conspiracies against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.22.&lt;/ref&gt; A conspiracy involving [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|his brother-in-law]] was foiled in late 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards, the Governor of Germany, [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus]], was executed for connections to a conspiracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;/&gt;

===Western expansion===
In AD 40, Caligula expanded the Roman Empire into [[Mauretania]] and made a significant attempt at expanding into [[Britannia]] – even challenging [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] in his campaign. The conquest of Britannia was fully realized by his successors.

====Mauretania====
Mauretania was a [[client kingdom]] of Rome ruled by [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]]. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then suddenly had him executed.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#35 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and subsequently divided into two provinces, [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], separated by the river [[Moulouya River|Malua]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' V.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny claims that division was the work of Caligula, but Dio states that in 42 AD an uprising took place, which was subdued by [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#8 LX.8]&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett118&quot;&gt;Barrett 2002, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in 44 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett118&quot;/&gt;

Details on the Mauretanian events of 39–44 are unclear. [[Cassius Dio]] wrote an entire chapter on the annexation of Mauretania by Caligula, but it is now lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#25 LIX.25].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion may not have been prompted by pressing military or economic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sigman |first1=Marlene C.|year=1977 |title=The Romans and the Indigenous Tribes of Mauritania Tingitana |journal=Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=415–439 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |doi= |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4435574 |accessdate= 10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebellion of [[Tacfarinas]] had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett118&quot;/&gt;

====Britannia====
There seems to have been a northern campaign to Britannia that was aborted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot; /&gt; This campaign is derided by ancient historians with accounts of [[Gaul]]s dressed up as Germanic tribesmen at his triumph and Roman troops ordered to collect seashells as &quot;spoils of the sea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#45 45–47].&lt;/ref&gt; The few primary sources disagree on what precisely occurred. Modern historians have put forward numerous theories in an attempt to explain these actions. This trip to the [[English Channel]] could have merely been a training and scouting mission.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bicknell, &quot;The Emperor Gaius' Military Activities in AD 40&quot;, ''Historia'' 17 (1968), 496–505.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission may have been to accept the surrender of the British chieftain [[Adminius]].&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Davies, &quot;The Abortive Invasion of Britain by Gaius&quot;, ''Historia'' 15 (1966), 124–128; S.J.V.Malloch, 'Gaius on the Channel Coast', Classical Quarterly 51 (2001) 551-56; See Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#44 44].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Seashells&quot;, or ''conchae'' in Latin, may be a metaphor for something else such as female genitalia (perhaps the troops visited brothels) or boats (perhaps they captured several small British boats).&lt;ref&gt;D. Wardle, ''Suetonius' Life of Caligula: a Commentary'' (Brussels, 1994), 313; David Woods &quot;Caligula's Seashells&quot;, ''Greece and Rome'' (2000), 80–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of divinity===
[[File:RomaForoRomanoTempioCastori.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruins of the temple of [[Castor and Pollux]] in the [[Forum Romanum]]. Ancient resources as well as recent archaeological evidence suggest that, at one point, Caligula had the palace extended to annex this structure.]]When several kings came to Rome to pay their respects to him and argued about their nobility of descent, he cried out &quot;Let there be one lord, one king.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#22 22]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 40, Caligula began implementing very controversial policies that introduced religion into his political role. Caligula began appearing in public dressed as various gods and demigods such as [[Hercules]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XI|XI–XV]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he began referring to himself as a god when meeting with politicians and he was referred to as &quot;Jupiter&quot; on occasion in public documents.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28].&lt;/ref&gt;

A sacred precinct was set apart for his worship at Miletus in the province of Asia and two temples were erected for worship of him in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot; /&gt; The [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]] on the forum was linked directly to the imperial residence on the Palatine and dedicated to Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, J.: &quot;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/10%20september/caligula-910.html Did Caligula have a God complex?], ''Stanford Report'', 10 September 2003. {{wayback|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/10%20september/caligula-910.html |date=20120224113813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would appear here on occasion and present himself as a god to the public. Caligula had the heads removed from various statues of gods and replaced with his own in some temples.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p. 209. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he wished to be worshipped as &quot;''Neos Helios,''&quot; the &quot;New Sun.&quot; Indeed, he was represented as a sun god on Egyptian coins.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Ward, Cedric Yeo, and Fritz Heichelheim, ''A History of the Roman People: Third Edition'', 1999, Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula's religious policy was a departure from that of his predecessors. According to [[Cassius Dio]], living emperors could be worshipped as divine in the east and dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-51&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LI.20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustus]] had the public [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|worship his spirit]] on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-51&quot;/&gt; Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern policy===
Caligula needed to quell several riots and conspiracies in the eastern territories during his reign. Aiding him in his actions was his good friend, [[Herod Agrippa]], who became governor of the territories of Batanaea and Trachonitis after Caligula became emperor in AD 37.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 6|XVIII.6.10]]; Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#V|V.25]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of tensions in the east was complicated, involving the [[Hellenization|spread of Greek culture]], [[Roman Law]] and the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|rights of Jews in the empire]].

Caligula did not trust the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' III.8, IV.21.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.26–28.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.29.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish [[synagogue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus VI|VI.43]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, riots broke out in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#VII|VII.45]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#XXI|XXI.185]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 39, Agrippa accused [[Herod Antipas]], the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Perea]], of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of [[Parthia]]. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was rewarded with his territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 7|XVIII.7.2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots again erupted in Alexandria in AD 40 between Jews and Greeks.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 8|XVIII.8.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;/&gt; Disputes occurred in the city of Jamnia.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-30&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.201]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-30&quot; /&gt; In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish [[Temple of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-statue&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.203]].&lt;/ref&gt; a demand in conflict with Jewish monotheism.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-caligula-16&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XVI|XVI.115]].&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[Philo]] wrote that Caligula &quot;regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-caligula-16&quot;/&gt;

The [[Roman Governor|Governor]] of Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXXI|XXXI.213]].&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Caligula sestertius RIC 33 680999.jpg|thumb|Roman [[sestertius]] depicting Caligula, ''c.'' AD 38. The reverse shows Caligula's three sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla and Julia Livilla, with whom Caligula was rumoured to have carried on incestuous relationships.]]

===Scandals===
[[File:Caligula und Roma Kameo KHM IXa 59.jpg|thumb|Cameo depicting Caligula and a personification of Rome]]

[[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Seneca the Younger]] describe Caligula as an insane emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and indulged in too much spending and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' xviii.1, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1; ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5; Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.1.&lt;/ref&gt; killing for mere amusement,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1.&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5.&lt;/ref&gt; and wanting a statue of himself erected in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] for his worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-statue&quot;/&gt; Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the crowd into the arena during intermission to be eaten by animals because there were no criminals to be prosecuted and he was bored.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Daily life in the Roman City&quot;. Aldrete, Gregory.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

While repeating the earlier stories, the later sources of [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] provide additional tales of insanity. They accuse Caligula of [[incest]] with his sisters, [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Julia Livilla|Livilla]], and say he prostituted them to other men.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#11 LIX.11], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#22 LIX.22]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#24 24].&lt;/ref&gt; They state he sent troops on illogical military exercises,&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#46 46–47].&lt;/ref&gt; turned the palace into a brothel,&lt;ref name = &quot;gjxxsj&quot;/&gt; and, most famously, planned or promised to make his horse, [[Incitatus]], a consul,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#55 55]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14].&lt;/ref&gt;
and actually appointed him a priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot;/&gt;

The validity of these accounts is debatable. In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Younger |first=John G. |title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-24252-5|pages=xvi |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination and aftermath===
Caligula's actions as emperor were described{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as being especially harsh to the senate, to the nobility and to the equestrian order.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] against Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' 16.17; Josephus, ''Antiquities of Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, officers within the [[Praetorian Guard]] led by [[Cassius Chaerea]] succeeded in murdering the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.3]].&lt;/ref&gt; The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order were said to have been informed of it and involved in it.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.10]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula announced to the senate that he planned to leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshiped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.
[[File:CaligulaPallazzoMassimoRoma.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Caligula from Palazzo Massimo in Rome]]
According to Josephus, Chaerea had political motivations for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.6]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius sees the motive in Caligula calling Chaerea derogatory names.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula considered Chaerea effeminate because of a weak voice and for not being firm with tax collection.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula would mock Chaerea with names like &quot;[[Priapus]]&quot; and &quot;[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 41 (Suetonius gives the date as 24 January), Cassius Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula as he addressed an acting troupe of young men during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt; Details recorded on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea stabbed Caligula first, followed by a number of conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius records that Caligula's death resembled that of [[Julius Caesar]]. He states that both the elder Gaius Julius Caesar (Julius Caesar) and the younger Gaius Julius Caesar (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius ([[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]] and Cassius Chaerea).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#57 57], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the Emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 1|XIX.1.15]]; Suetonius, Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[cryptoporticus]]'' (underground corridor) beneath the imperial palaces on the Palatine Hill where this event took place was discovered by archaeologists in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2598026.ece Archaeologists unearth place where Emperor Caligula met his end] by Richard Owen, 17 October 2008. Retrieved 2010-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The senate attempted to use Caligula's death as an opportunity to restore the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Chaerea tried to persuade the military to support the senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-19-4-4&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 4|XIX.4.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; The military, though, remained loyal to the idea of imperial monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-19-4-4&quot; /&gt; The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XI.1; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]], and killed their young daughter, [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]], by smashing her head against a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 59.&lt;/ref&gt; They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]]; after a soldier, [[Gratus]], found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain he was spirited out of the city by a sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Suetonius|title= The Lives}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the nearby Praetorian camp.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius became emperor after procuring the support of the Praetorian Guard. He ordered the execution of Chaerea and of any other known conspirators involved in the death of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;
Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 3|XIX.3.1]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Suetonius, Caligula's body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters. He was buried within the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]; in 410, during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] ashes in the tomb were scattered.

===Historiography===
[[File:Cor-aabr001903.jpg|upright|thumb|Fanciful renaissance depiction of Caligula]]
The history of Caligula's reign is extremely problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — the works of [[Philo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Philo's works, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' and ''Flaccus'', give some details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, there were detailed contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Cluvius Rufus]] both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus was a friend of Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' X, ''Annals'' XIII.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula's sister, [[Agrippina the Younger]], wrote an autobiography that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]], who conspired against Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot; /&gt; The inheritance of [[Nero]], Agrippina's son and the future emperor, was seized by Caligula. [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus|Gaetulicus]], a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.

The bulk of what is known of Caligula comes from [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]]. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Cassius Dio's work is invaluable because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign.

A handful of other sources add a limited perspective on Caligula. [[Josephus]] gives a detailed description of Caligula's assassination. [[Tacitus]] provides some information on Caligula's life under [[Tiberius]]. In a now lost portion of his ''Annals'', Tacitus gave a detailed history of Caligula. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' has a few brief references to Caligula.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. The paucity of sources has resulted in significant gaps in modern knowledge of the reign of Caligula. Little is written on the first two years of Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of [[Mauretania]], Caligula's military actions in [[Britannia]], and his feud with the [[Roman Senate]].

===Health===
All surviving sources, except [[Pliny the Elder]], characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is not known whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities [[encephalitis]], [[epilepsy]] or [[meningitis]]. The question of whether or not Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.

[[Philo of Alexandria]], [[Josephus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] state that Caligula was insane, but describe this madness as a personality trait that came through experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVIII.1; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and used his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVII–XVIII; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to think he was a god.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot; /&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' II–IV.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]] reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.

[[Suetonius]] said that Caligula suffered from &quot;falling sickness&quot;, or [[epilepsy]], when he was young.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have theorized that Caligula lived with a daily fear of seizures.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomas Benediktson, &quot;Caligula's Phobias and Philias: Fear of Seizure?&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'' (1991) pp. 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite swimming being a part of imperial education, Caligula could not swim.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus 64, Life of Caligula 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Epileptics are discouraged from swimming in open waters because unexpected fits in such difficult rescue circumstances can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Pearn, &quot;Epilepsy and Drowning in Childhood,&quot; ''British Medical Journal'' (1977) pp. 1510–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Caligula reportedly talked to the full moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot; /&gt; Epilepsy was long associated with the moon.&lt;ref&gt;O. Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness'' (2nd ed., Baltimore 1971) 3–4, 7, 13, 16, 26, 86, 92–96, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern historians think that Caligula suffered from [[hyperthyroidism]].&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Katz, &quot;The Illness of Caligula&quot; CW 65(1972),223-25, refuted by M.G. Morgan, &quot;Caligula's Illness Again&quot;, CW 66(1973), 327–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This diagnosis is mainly attributed to Caligula's irritability and his &quot;stare&quot; as described by Pliny the Elder.

===Possible rediscovery of burial site===
On 17 January 2011, police in [[Nemi]], Italy, announced that they believed they had discovered the site of Caligula's burial, after arresting a thief caught smuggling a statue which they believed to be of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/17/caligula-tomb-found-police-statue?CMP=twt_fd |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Tom |last=Kington |title=Caligula's tomb found after police arrest man trying to smuggle statue |date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim has been met with scepticism by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] historian [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=This isn't Caligula's tomb |first=Mary |last= Beard |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2011/01/this-isnt-caligulas-tomb.html |work=A don's life |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |location=London |date= 18 January 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh actor [[Emlyn Williams]] was cast as Caligula in the never-completed 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]''.&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite news |title='Caligula' Gives a Toga Party (but No One's Really Invited) |first=Linda |last= Yablonsky |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/arts/design/26yabl.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= 26 February 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American actor [[Jay Robinson]] famously portrayed a sinister and scene-stealing Caligula in two epic films of the 1950s, ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953) and its sequel ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1979&quot;&gt;Robinson, Jay.

A feature-length historical film ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' was completed in [[1979 in film|1979]], in which [[Malcolm McDowell]] played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with extremely explicit sex and violence and received extremely negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:7895~T1 Caligula &gt; Overview – AllMovie.com].

David Brandon portrayed Caligula in the 1982 Italian exploitation film ''Emperor Caligula, the Untold Story'' which was directed by [[Joe D'Amato]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[Courtney Love]] appeared as Caligula in a fake trailer for ''Gore Vidal's Caligula'', ostensibly a remake of the 1979 film, but actually a parodic short film by conceptual artist [[Francesco Vezzoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;

Szabolcs Hajdu portrayed Caligula in the 1996 film ''Caligula''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===In literature and theatre===
''Caligula'', by French author [[Albert Camus]], is a play in which Caligula returns after deserting the palace for three days and three nights following the death of his beloved sister, Drusilla. The young emperor then uses his unfettered power to &quot;bring the impossible into the realm of the likely&quot;.

In the 1934 novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'' by English writer [[Robert Graves]], Caligula is presented as being a murderous sociopath from his childhood, who became clinically insane early in his reign. At the age of only seven, he drove his father [[Germanicus]] to despair and death by secretly terrorising him. Graves's Caligula commits incest with all three of his sisters and is implied to have murdered Drusilla.

In the BBC series based on Graves' novel (where the role is played by [[John Hurt]]), Caligula, although unhinged since early childhood, becomes dangerously psychotic after an apparent epileptic seizure and awakens believing that he has metamorphosed into the god Zeus. He kills Drusilla while trying to reenact the birth of [[Athena]] by cutting his child from her womb.

In 1941, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] wrote [[I Am a Barbarian]]. The story is pitched as a free translation of the memoirs of Britannicus (a fictional character created by Burroughs)  who was the slave of Caligula from early childhood till Caligula's death.

The character Ellsworth Toohey in [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1943 novel [[The Fountainhead]] references Caligula in his climactic speech to Peter Keating stating, &quot;Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we'll have the last laugh. We've accomplished what he couldn't accomplish. We've taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash.&quot;

The play ''The Reckoning of Kit and Little Boots'', by [[Nat Cassidy]], examines the lives of the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]] and Caligula, with the fictional conceit that Marlowe was working on a play about Caligula around the time of his own murder. It emphasizes the similarities between the two characters—both stabbed to death at 29, both in part as a result of their controversial religious perspectives. The play focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/451942,8.html] {{wayback|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/451942,8.html |date=20140225234827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytheatrecast.com/wordpress/archives/98 |title=Episode #223 – The Reckoning of Kit &amp; Boots and Hope's Arbor |date= 4 June 2008 |work=NYTHEATRECAST |publisher=The New York Theatre Experience |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207082406/http://www.nytheatrecast.com/wordpress/archives/98 |archivedate=7 December 2008 |format=[[Podcast]] ([[MP3]])|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene O'Neill's play [[Lazarus Laughed]] features the young Caligula as one of pinnacle characters, where he is portrayed as a psychopath who believes he will only be happy once Tiberius is dead and he is the Caesar.

===In music===
Canadian death metal band [[Ex Deo]] released an album called ''Caligula'', styled as ''Caligvla''. The band's video, &quot;I Caligula&quot;, features Caligula and other members of his court that were important in his rule.

[[The Smiths]] song &quot;[[Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now]]&quot; refers to Caligula: &quot;What she asked of me at the end of the day/Caligula would have blushed&quot;.

[[The Dickies]]' 1989 album ''[[Second Coming (Dickies album)|Second Coming]]'' includes the song &quot;Caligula,&quot; which relates his origins and reign of terror.

[[Post-hardcore]] band [[Glassjaw]]'s song &quot;Convectuoso&quot; refers to Caligula in the opening lines: &quot;I am Caligula, glutton of gluttons, man over woman, man of all women, the whore of all man.&quot;

===In television===
Caligula has been portrayed in a number of television series.

In episode 8, &quot;The Road To [[Damascus]]&quot;, he is shown personally murdering Tiberius during their return trip to Rome, but the historical accuracy is debatable due to the scene being a dream of [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]], wife of [[Pontius Pilate]]. Nevertheless, he returns to Jerusalem announcing that his great-uncle is dead and he is the new emperor.

'''Claudius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔː|d|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus}};&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of the name of Claudius:
#{{sqc|TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|tɪ'bɛ.ri.ʊs 'klau̯.di.ʊs 'kae̯.sar au̯'gʊs.tus gɛr'maː.nɪ.kʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudius' regal name has an equivalent English meaning of &quot;Tiberius Claudius Caesar, the Majestic Ruler, Conqueror of the Germans&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD) was [[Roman emperor]] from 41 to 54. A member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], he was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]]. He was born at [[Lugdunum]] in [[Gaul]], the first Roman Emperor to be born outside [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his [[Roman consul|consulship]], shared with his nephew [[Caligula]] in 37.

Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of [[Tiberius]] and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]] after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family.

Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] (if the earlier [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain by Caesar]] and Caligula's aborted attempts are not counted). Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day.

He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many [[Roman Senate|senators]]. These events damaged his reputation among the  ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife.  After his death in 54 AD (at age of 63), his grand-nephew and adopted son [[Nero]] succeeded him as Emperor.

He was a descendant of the [[Octavii Rufi]] (through [[Gaius Octavius]]), [[Julii Caesares]] (through [[Julia Caesaris (youngest sister of Julius Caesar)|Julia Atii]] and [[Julia Antonia|Julia Antonii]]) and the [[Claudii Nerones]] (through [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]); he was a great-nephew of [[Augustus]] through his full sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia Minor]], an uncle of [[Caligula]] and finally a great-uncle of [[Nero]] through Caligula's father and Nero's grandfather [[Germanicus]].

==Family and early life==
{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
Claudius was born on 1 August 10 BC at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in what is now [[Lyon, France|Lyon]], France. He had two older siblings, [[Germanicus]] and [[Livilla]]. His mother, Antonia, may have had two other children who died young.

His maternal grandparents were [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], [[Augustus]]' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Livia]], Augustus' third wife, and [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.

In 9 BC, his father Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off on his grandmother Livia for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Hist.'' LX 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Livia was a little kinder, but nevertheless often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a &quot;former mule-driver&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 2. Suet ''Claud.'' 4 indicates the reasons for choosing this tutor, as outlined in Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet4&quot;&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 7 AD, [[Livy]] was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher [[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]]. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet4&quot;/&gt; Expectations about his future began to increase.

===Public life===
His work as a budding historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] that was either too truthful or too critical of [[Octavian]]&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;—then reigning as [[Augustus Caesar]]. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing party line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart&quot;&gt;Stuart (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the second triumvirate altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him to the background. When the [[Triumphal arch|Arch]] of [[Pavia]] was erected to honor the Imperial clan in 8 BC, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to [[paterfamilias]] of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge—past the deceased princes, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart&quot;/&gt;

[[File:A Roman Emperor AD41 detail.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gratus]] proclaims Claudius emperor. Detail from ''A Roman Emperor 41AD'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]. Oil on canvas, c. 1871.]]
When Augustus died in 14 AD, Claudius — then 23 — appealed to his uncle [[Tiberius]] to allow him to begin the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new Emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.

Despite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'', or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.

During the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, [[Julius Caesar Drusus|Drusus]], Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Sejanus]], was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.

After the death of Tiberius the new emperor [[Caligula]] (the son of Claudius' brother [[Germanicus]]) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to [[Cassius Dio]] Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to stress.&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2. Suhr (1955) suggests that this must refer to before Claudius came to power.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.

===Assassination of Caligula (41 AD)===
[[File:Herold of Chalcis coin showing Herod of Chalcis with brother Agrippa of Judaea crowning Roman Emperor Claudius I.jpg|thumb|A coin of [[Herod of Chalcis]], showing him with his brother [[Herod Agrippa I|Agrippa of Judaea]] crowning Claudius. [[British Museum]].]]

On 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] involving the Praetorian commander [[Cassius Chaerea]] and several [[Roman Senate|senators]]. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the [[assassination]], although it has been argued that he knew about the plot — particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Major (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the deaths of [[Milonia Caesonia|Caligula's wife]] and [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|daughter]], it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephus&quot;&gt;Josephus ''Antiquitates Iudiacae'' XIX. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#1 LX 1.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the [[Germania|German]] guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named [[Gratus]] found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him ''[[princeps]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephus&quot;/&gt; A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] and put under their protection.

The Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new ''princeps''. When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the [[Iudaea Province|Judaean]] King [[Herod Agrippa]]. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Bellum Iudiacum'' II, 204–233.&lt;/ref&gt; so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.

[[Image:Claudiuspax.jpg|thumb|250px|Claudius issued this ''[[denarius]]'' type to emphasize his [[clemency]] after Caligula's assassination. The depiction of the goddess [[Pax-Nemesis]], representing subdued vengeance, would be used on the coins of many later emperors.]]

{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Claudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name &quot;Caesar&quot; as a [[cognomen]], as the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen &quot;Nero&quot; which he had adopted as ''paterfamilias'' of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

While Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of his sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name &quot;Augustus&quot; as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific &quot;Germanicus&quot; to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term &quot;filius Drusi&quot; (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Since Claudius was the first Emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their [[will (law)|wills]], and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Expansion of the Empire==
Under Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of [[Thrace]], [[Noricum]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycia]], and [[Judea]] were [[annexation|annexed]] (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of [[Mauretania]], begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 5.1–5.2, Cassius Dio, 60.8, 60.9&lt;/ref&gt; The most far-reaching conquest was the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britannia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman emperor head.jpg|thumb|250px|Bronze head of Claudius found in the [[River Alde]] at [[Rendham]], near [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk ([[British Museum]]). Potentially taken from the [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple of Claudius]] in [[Colonia Victricensis]] during the [[Sack of Camulodunum|Boudican revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/b/bronze_head_of_claudius.aspx|title= Head of the Emperor Claudius|publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 43 AD, Claudius sent [[Aulus Plautius]] with four [[Roman legion|legions]] to Britain (''Britannia'') after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth&amp;nbsp;– particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for [[Gaul|Gallic]] rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself travelled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the [[British people|Britons]] when they were displayed in the large tribal centre of [[Camulodunum]], modern day [[Colchester]]. The Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' of ''Colonia Claudia Victricensis'' was established as the provincial capital of the newly established [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] at Camulodunum,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crummy 97&quot;&gt;Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust (ISBN 1 897719 04 3)&lt;/ref&gt; where a large [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple was dedicated in his honour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crummy 97&quot;/&gt;

He left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific &quot;Britannicus&quot; but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the Briton general [[Caractacus]] was captured in 50 AD, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.

Claudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 7, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; (adult males with [[Roman citizenship]]; women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.

===Judicial and legislative affairs===

Claudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 15. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scramuzza ch6&quot;/&gt;

He extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scramuzza ch6&quot;&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of [[Rhodes]] from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted [[Troy]] from taxes. Early in his reign, the [[Greeks]] and [[Jews of Alexandria]] sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous &quot;Letter to the Alexandrians&quot;, which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to [[Josephus]], he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.5.3 (287).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the modern city of [[Trento]] were not in fact citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the ''[[Tabula clesiana]]'', that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the [[Roman equestrian order]] were sold back into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting [[Taxus baccata|yew]] juice as a cure for [[snakebite]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#32 32]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the [[temple of Aesculapius]] on [[Tiber Island]] to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works===
Claudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], the [[Aqua Claudia]], begun by [[Caligula]], and the [[Anio Novus]]. These entered the city in 52 and met at the famous [[Porta Maggiore]]. He also restored a third, the [[Aqua Virgo]].

[[File:Esquilino - Porta Maggiore - st1.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Porta Maggiore]] aqueduct in Rome]]
He paid special attention to transportation. Throughout [[Italy]] and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the [[Rhine]] to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany&amp;nbsp;– both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the [[Tiber]], leading to [[Portus]], his new port just north of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.

The port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the [[Lex Papia Poppaea|Lex Papia-Poppaea]], a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that [[Caligula]] had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering [[drought]] or [[famine]].

The last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the [[Fucine lake]], which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 57&lt;/ref&gt; A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake was revisited many times in history, including by Emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. It was finally achieved by the Prince [[Torlonia]] in the 19th century, producing over {{convert|160000|acre|km2}} of new arable land.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 9, pp. 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.

===Claudius and the Senate===
Because of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as Holder of the Power of [[Tribune]] (The Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]], but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including [[Imperator]]) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the Imperial provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] back under Senate control.

Claudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:

{{quote|If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.&lt;ref&gt;English translation of Berlin papyrus by W.D. Hogarth, in Momigliano (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 47 he assumed the office of ''[[Roman censor|Censor]]'' with [[Lucius Vitellius]], which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The [[Lyon Tablet]] preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. (He even jokes about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond [[Gallia Narbonensis]] ([[Lyons, France]]), i.e. himself).  He also increased the number of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

Nevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.

==== Plots and coup attempts ====
Several [[coup]] attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. [[Appius Silanus]] was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances. Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator Vinicianus and [[Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus|Scribonianus]], the governor of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, and the [[suicide]] of the main conspirators.

Many other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Claudia Antonia's first husband)|Pompeius Magnus]] was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.

In 46, [[Asinius Gallus]], the grandson of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], and [[Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus]] were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. [[Valerius Asiaticus]] was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was [[adultery]], and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.

Asiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as [[Roman censor|Censor]], and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of [[Gaius Silius]] in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, [[Messalina]]. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, the responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.

===Secretariat and centralization of powers===
Claudius was hardly the first emperor to use [[Freedman|freedmen]] to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the ''princeps'' became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.

The secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] was the secretary of correspondence. [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]] became the secretary of the treasury. [[Gaius Julius Callistus|Callistus]] became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]] until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tac&quot;&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 65. Seneca ''Ad Polybium.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tac&quot;/&gt;

He was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the Emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, [[Antonius Felix|Felix]]. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.

Regardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. [[Pliny the Elder]] notes that several of them were richer than [[Crassus]], the richest man of the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Natural History'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious reforms===
[[File:Claudius (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Claudius, [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]]]
Claudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He re-instituted old observances and archaic language.

Claudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as [[haruspices]]) as a replacement. He was especially hard on [[Druidism]], because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] activities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

It is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the Jews within the city caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of [[Chrestus]].&lt;ref&gt;There is some debate about what actually happened. It is reported by Suetonius and in Acts (18:2), Cassius Dio minimizes the event and Josephus—who was reporting on Jewish events—does not mention it at all. Some scholars hold that it didn't happen, while others have only a few missionaries expelled for the short term.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius opposed proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely. The results of all these efforts were recognized even by Seneca, who has an ancient Latin god defend Claudius in his satire.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public games and entertainments===
According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Annual games were also held in honour of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;&gt;Suet. Claud. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius organised a performance of the [[Secular Games]], marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the [[Fucine Lake]], as well as many other public games and shows.

At Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a [[killer whale]] which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by [[Pliny the Elder]]:

{{quote|A killer whale was actually seen in the harbour of Ostia, locked in combat with the emperor Claudius. She had come when he was completing the construction of the harbour, drawn there by the wreck of a ship bringing leather hides from Gaul, and feeding there over a number of days, had made a furrow in the shallows: the waves had raised up such a mound of sand that she couldn't turn around at all, and while she was pursuing her banquet as the waves moved it shorewards, her back stuck up out of the water like the overturned keel of a boat. The Emperor ordered that a large array of nets be stretched across the mouths of the harbour, and setting out in person with the Praetorian cohorts gave a show to the Roman people, soldiers showering lances from attacking ships, one of which I saw swamped by the beast's waterspout and sunk. — &quot;''Historia Naturalis''&quot; IX.14–15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostia-antica.org/~atexts/plinsen.htm Translation of] Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claudius also restored and adorned many of the venues around Rome. The old wooden barriers of the [[Circus Maximus]] were replaced with ones made of gold-ornamented marble.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; A new section of the Circus was designated for seating the senators, who previously had sat among the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; Claudius rebuilt [[Pompey's Theatre]] after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt;

==Marriages and personal life==
Suetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, of being [[wikt:uxorious|uxorious]], and of being a [[Womanizing|womanizer]].

Claudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]], but was broken for political reasons. The second was to [[Livia Medullina]], which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.

===Plautia Urgulanilla===
[[Plautia Urgulanilla]] was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant [[Urgulania]]. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of [[Sejanus]].

Claudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius [[repudiate]]d the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. This action made him later the target of criticism by his enemies.

===Aelia Paetina===
Soon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married [[Aelia Paetina]], a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, [[Claudia Antonia]]. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.

===Valeria Messalina===
Some years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married [[Valeria Messalina]], who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter [[Claudia Octavia]]. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as [[Britannicus]], was born just after Claudius' accession.

This marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius — [[Tacitus]] states she went so far as to compete with a [[prostitute]] to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI 10. Also Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 31, and Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' X 172.&lt;/ref&gt; — and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover [[Gaius Silius (consul designatus 49 AD)|Gaius Silius]] in a public ceremony while Claudius was at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]].

Sources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;90. Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7. Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Tacitus]] suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI. 25, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.212. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius made the [[Praetorians]] promise to kill him if he ever married again. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Agrippina the Younger===
Claudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen pushed three candidates, [[Caligula]]'s third wife [[Lollia Paulina]], Claudius's divorced second wife [[Aelia Paetina]] and Claudius's niece [[Agrippina the Younger]]. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The truth is likely more political. The attempted [[coup d'etat]] by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scramuzza91-92&quot;&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor [[Nero]]) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested in recent times that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scramuzza91-92&quot;/&gt; This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband [[Germanicus]] (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.

Nero was made joint heir with the underage [[Britannicus]], married to Octavia and promoted. This was not as unusual as it seems, to people acquainted with hereditary monarchies. [[Barbara Levick]] notes that Augustus had named his grandson [[Postumus Agrippa]] and his stepson [[Tiberius]] as joint heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;70. See also Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberius named [[Caligula]] joint heir with his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]]. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome, when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable as was the case during Britannicus' minority. S.V. Oost suggests that Claudius had previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.&lt;ref&gt;Oost (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], married to his daughter [[Claudia Antonia]], was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side&amp;nbsp;– not close enough to the Imperial family to prevent doubts (that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half-brother of [[Valeria Messalina]] and at this time those wounds were still fresh. [[Nero]] was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.

==Claudius' affliction and personality==
[[File:Statue Claudius Vatikanische Museen.jpg|thumb|220px|Claudius depicted as the [[Jupiter (mythology)|Roman god Jupiter]]]]
The historian [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail.&lt;ref name = &quot;boyjnt&quot;&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] states in his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;boyjnt&quot;/&gt; When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to [[World War II]], [[infantile paralysis]] (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in [[Robert Graves]]' [[Claudius (novel)|Claudius novels]], first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates [[cerebral palsy]] as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon.&lt;ref&gt;Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tourette syndrome]] has also been considered a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, George. [http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/p5m-tor1.html The Imperial Gene], ''The Medical Post'', 16 July 1996. Retrieved 24 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1080/09647040902872775|pmid= 20628951|title= A Neurological Mystery from History: The Case of Claudius Caesar|year= 2010|last1= Murad|first1= Ali|journal= Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|volume= 19|issue= 3|pages= 221–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the [[plebeians]].&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 5, 21, 40; Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 5, 12, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, overly fond of [[gladiator]]ial combat and executions, and very quick to anger; Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 34, 38. Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 20.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ancient historians he was also overly trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extant works of Claudius present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his &quot;[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/claualex.html Letter to the Alexandrians]&quot; in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.

==Scholarly works and their impact==
Claudius wrote copiously throughout his life. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] states that during the reign of Tiberius&amp;nbsp;– which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career&amp;nbsp;– it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] history and eight volumes on [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] history, as well as an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] dictionary and a book on dice playing. (Claudius is actually the last person known to have been able to read Etruscan.){{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Despite the general avoidance of the Republican era, he penned a defense of [[Cicero]] against the charges of [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus|Asinius Gallus]]. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.

[[File:Claudian letters.svg|thumb|The [[Claudian letters]].]]
He proposed a reform of the [[Latin alphabet]] by the addition of [[Claudian letters|three new letters]], two of which served the function of the modern letters ''W'' and ''Y''. He officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography, that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches,&lt;ref&gt;See Claudius' letter to the people of Trent (linked below), in which he refers to the &quot;obstinate retirement&quot; of Tiberius. See also Josephus ''Ant Iud.'' XIX, where an edict of Claudius refers to Caligula's &quot;madness and lack of understanding.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.

None of the works survive but live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Momigliano (1934) Chap.&amp;nbsp;1, note&amp;nbsp;20 (p.&amp;nbsp;83). Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The detail of his speech borders on the pedantic, a common mark of all his extant works and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects, that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by [[Julius Caesar]]. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

His censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans) that his ancestor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] had used the censorship to introduce [[R|the letter &quot;R&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1993) refers to the historian [[Varro]]'s account of the introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.

==Death==
[[File:Togato con tesa dell'imperatore claudio, inv. 2221.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Claudius in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican museum]].]]
The consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison&amp;nbsp;– possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather&amp;nbsp;– and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD. Accounts vary greatly. Some claim Claudius was in Rome&lt;ref name=Suet44&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim he was in [[Sinuessa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all implicate his final wife, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 43&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.

Some implicate either his taster [[Halotus]], his doctor [[Gaius Stertinius Xenophon|Xenophon]], or the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] as the administrator of the fatal substance.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of his death: Suet. ''Claud.'' 43, 44. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 64, 66–67. Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XX 148, 151. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 34. Pliny ''Natural History'' II xxiii 92, XI lxxiii 189, XXII xlvi 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again.&lt;ref name=Suet44/&gt; Among contemporary sources, Seneca the younger ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors on his poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities of the Jews 19:67; 20:148&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp. 92–93 says that tradition makes every emperor the victim of foul play, so we can't know if Claudius was truly murdered. Indeed, the Emperor appears to have been seriously ill since at least 53 AD. Levick (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77. raises the possibility that Claudius was killed by the stress of fighting with Agrippina over the succession, but concludes that the timing makes murder the most likely cause.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990); also as opposed to the murder of Augustus, which is only found in Tacitus and Dio where he quotes Tacitus. Suetonius, an inveterate gossip, doesn't mention it at all.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius' ashes were interred in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] on 24 October 54 AD, after a funeral in the manner of Augustus.

==After death==

===Divine honours===
Already, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living [[Princeps]]&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-927548-9&lt;/ref&gt; and was worshipped in [[Britannia]] in his own [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|temple in Camulodunum]].

Claudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been &quot;hated&quot;, as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only a few months later.

===Views of the new regime===
Agrippina had sent away [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence — most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Seneca's [[Apocolocyntosis]] reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool and this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]].&lt;ref name = &quot;iiovah&quot;&gt;Levick (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavian and later perspectives===
The [[Flavians]], who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son [[Britannicus]], who had been a friend of the Emperor [[Titus]] (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]] was burned, the [[Temple of Claudius]] was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.&lt;ref name = &quot;iiovah&quot;/&gt;

However, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all such cults of dead Emperors by [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 237–238.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-927548-9 p.&amp;nbsp;356–341&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', probably identical to the festival calendars of every regular army unit, assigns him a sacrifice of a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] on his birthday, the [[Kalends]] of August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6mce147Z_EEC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=Feriale+Duranum#v=onepage&amp;q=Feriale%20Duranum&amp;f=false |title = Rome and Its Empire, AD 193-284 |isbn = 978-0-7486-2304-4 |author1 = Hekster |first1 = Olivier |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; And such commemoration (and consequent feasting) probably continued until the Christianization and disintegration of the army in the late 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-927548-9 p.367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of ancient historians===
The main ancient historians [[Tacitus]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], and [[Cassius Dio]] all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or ''equites''. They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Vessey (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and often in public life. During his censorship of 47-8 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23-25), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius' writings and to have omitted Claudius' character from his works.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1990). ''Ann.'' XI 14 is often thought to be a good example: the digression on the history of writing is actually Claudius' own argument for his new letters, and fits in with his personality and extant writings. Tacitus makes no explicit attribution - and so there exists the possibility that the digression is Tacitus' own work or derivative of another source&lt;/ref&gt; Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the Emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.

As time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, [[Pertinax]], who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;Levick. ''Claudius'' p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern literature, film and radio==
The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius were the books ''[[I, Claudius]]'' and ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (published in 1934 and 1935) by [[Robert Graves]], both written in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius' [[autobiography]]. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, ''Claudius the God''), to add authenticity.

In 1937, director [[Josef von Sternberg]] attempted a film version of ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', with [[Charles Laughton]] as Claudius. However, the lead actress [[Merle Oberon]] suffered a near-fatal accident and the movie was never finished. The surviving reels were featured in the BBC documentary ''The Epic That Never Was'' (1965). The motion picture rights for a new film eventually passed to producer [[Scott Rudin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/i-claudius.1/|title=I, Claudius (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves's two books were the basis for a British television adaptation ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The series starred [[Derek Jacobi]] as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/&lt;/ref&gt; It was a substantial critical success, and won several [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The series was later broadcast in the United States on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1977. The 1996 7-VHS release and the later DVD release of the television series, include the ''The Epic That Never Was'' documentary.

A radio adaptation of the Graves novels by [[Robin Brooks]] and directed by [[Jonquil Panting]], was broadcast in six one-hour episodes on [[BBC Radio 4]] beginning 4 December 2010. The cast featured [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Claudius, [[Derek Jacobi]] as Augustus, [[Harriet Walter]] as Livia, [[Tim McInnerny]] as Tiberius and [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Caligula.

In 2011, it was announced rights for a miniseries adaptation passed to HBO and BBC2.  Anne Thomopoulos and Jane Tranter, producers of the popular HBO–BBC2 ''[[Rome (TV Series)|Rome]]'' miniseries, are attached to the new ''I, Claudius'' project.

The 1954 film ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' also portrayed him sympathetically, played by [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]].

On television, [[Freddie Jones]] portrayed Claudius in the 1968 British [[television]] series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]''.

The 1975 TV Special ''Further Up Pompeii!'' (based on the [[Frankie Howerd]] sit-com ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'') featured [[Cyril Appleton]] as Claudius.

In the 1979 motion picture ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', where the role was performed by [[Giancarlo Badessi]], Claudius is depicted as an idiot, in contrast to [[Robert Graves]]' portrait of Claudius as a cunning and deeply intelligent man, who is perceived by others to be an idiot.

The 1985 made-for-television [[miniseries]] ''A.D.'' features actor [[Richard Kiley]] as Claudius.  Kiley portrays him as thoughtful, but willing to cater to public opinion as well as being under the influence of Agrippina.

There is also a reference to Claudius' suppression of a coup in the movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', though the incident is entirely fictional.

In literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel ''The Roman'' by [[Mika Waltari]]. Canadian-born science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]] reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story, in his two novels ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]''.

'''Nero''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪər|oʊ}}; [[Latin]]: ''Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus'';&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of the names of Nero:
#{{sqc|LVCIVS DOMITIVS AHENOBARBVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|'luː.ki.ʊs dɔ'mɪ.ti.ʊs a.eː.nɔ'bar.bʊs|IPA}}
#{{sqc|NERO CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|'nɛ.roː 'klau̯.di.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs gɛr'maː.nɪ.kʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Nero's birth day is listed in Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#6 6]. His death day is uncertain, though, perhaps because Galba was declared emperor before Nero died. The date of 9 June is calculated from Jerome, ''Chronicle'', which lists Nero's rule as 13 years, 7 months and 28 days. Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXII.3 and Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' IV, say Nero's rule was 13 years, 8 months which would be until 11 June.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Roman Emperor]] from 54 to 68, and the last in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Nero was [[Adoption in Ancient Rome|adopted by]] his grand-uncle [[Claudius]] to become his heir and successor, and succeeded to the throne in 54 following Claudius' death.

Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and enhancing the cultural life of the Empire, but according to the historian [[Tacitus]] he was viewed by the Roman people as compulsive and corrupt. He ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games. During his reign, the redoubtable general [[Corbulo]] conducted a [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63|successful war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthian Empire]]. His general [[Suetonius Paulinus]] crushed a [[Boudicca#Boudica's uprising|revolt in Britain]]. Nero annexed the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] to the Empire and began the [[First Roman–Jewish War]].

In 64 AD, most of Rome was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Rome]], which many Romans believed Nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex, the [[Domus Aurea]]. In 68, the rebellion of [[Vindex]] in [[Gaul]] and later the acclamation of [[Galba]] in [[Hispania]] drove Nero from the throne. Facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed, he committed suicide on 9 June 68 (the first Roman emperor to do so).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius states that Nero committed suicide in Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49 49]; Sulpicius Severus, who possibly used Tacitus' lost fragments as a source, reports that it was uncertain whether Nero committed suicide, Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronica'' II.29, also see T.D. Barnes, &quot;The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' (1977), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; His death ended the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. Nero's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance.&lt;ref&gt;Galba criticized Nero's ''luxuria'', both his public and private excessive spending, during rebellion, Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.16; Kragelund, Patrick, &quot;Nero's Luxuria, in Tacitus and in the Octavia&quot;, ''The Classical Quarterly'', 2000, pp. 494–515.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for many executions, including that of his mother,&lt;ref&gt;References to Nero's matricide appear in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'' 5.490–520, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' [[The Monk's Tale]] and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.ii.&lt;/ref&gt; and the probable murder by poison of his stepbrother [[Britannicus]].

Nero was rumored to have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-44&quot;/&gt; This view is based on the writings of Tacitus, [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]], the main surviving sources for Nero's reign, but a few surviving sources paint Nero in a more favourable light.&lt;ref&gt;These include Lucan's ''Civil War'', Seneca the Younger's ''On Mercy'' and Dio Chrysostom's ''Discourses'' along with various Roman coins and inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources, including some mentioned above, portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people, especially in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' I.4, I.5, I.13, II.8; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#57 57], Life of Otho 7, Life of Vitellius 11; Philostratus II, ''The Life of Apollonius'' 5.41; Dio Chrysostom, ''Discourse XXI'', On Beauty.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on Nero's tyrannical acts.&lt;ref&gt;On fire and Christian persecution, see F.W. Clayton, &quot;Tacitus and Christian Persecution&quot;, ''The Classical Quarterly'', pp. 81–85; B.W. Henderson, ''Life and Principate of the Emperor Nero'', p. 437; On general bias against Nero, see Edward Champlin, ''Nero'', Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]], 2003, pp. 36–52 (ISBN 0-674-01192-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Family===
{{See also|Roman Emperors family tree}}

'''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''', Nero, was born on 15 December 37 in [[Antium]] (modern [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]]&lt;ref&gt;Paola Brandizzi Vittucci, ''Antium: Anzio e Nettuno in epoca romana'', Roma, Bardi, 2000 ISBN 88-85699-83-9&lt;/ref&gt;), near Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-1&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-6&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#6 6].&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only son of [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]], sister of Emperor [[Caligula]].

Nero's father, Gnaeus, was the son of [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus]] (consul 16 BC) and [[Antonia Major]]. Gnaeus was thus the grandson of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC) and probably [[Aemilia Lepida]] on his father's side, and the grandson of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]] on his mother's side. Thus, Nero had as his paternal grandmother Antonia Major, and also claimed more remote descent from [[Antonia Minor]] as a great-grandson—later grandson after Claudius adopted him.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-5&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#5 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Octavia, Nero was the great-nephew of Caesar Augustus. Nero's father had been employed as a [[praetor]] and was a member of Caligula's staff when the latter travelled to the East (some apparently think Suetonius refers to Augustus' adopted son Gaius Caesar here, but this is not likely).&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-5&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#5 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero's father was described by Suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor [[Tiberius]] with treason, adultery and incest.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-5&quot;/&gt; Tiberius died, allowing him to escape these charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-5&quot;/&gt; Nero's father died of [[edema]] (&quot;dropsy&quot;) in 39 when Nero was two.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-5&quot;/&gt;

Nero's mother was Agrippina the Younger, a great-granddaughter of [[Caesar Augustus]] and his wife [[Scribonia]] through their daughter [[Julia the Elder]] and her husband [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. Agrippina's father, [[Germanicus]], was a grandson of Augustus's wife, [[Livia]], on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other. Germanicus' mother Antonia Minor, was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. Octavia was Augustus' elder sister. Germanicus was also the adopted son of Tiberius. Agrippina poisoned her second husband Passienus Crispus, so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband, the emperor Claudius.&lt;ref name=&quot;agrippina&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#66|XII.66]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#34 LXI.34]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#44 44]; Josephus is less sure, Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to power===
[[Image:NeroandClaudius.jpg|thumb|250px|Coin issued under [[Claudius]] celebrating young Nero as the future emperor, c. 50.]]
Nero was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle, [[Caligula]], had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir. Nero's mother, Agrippina, lost favour with Caligula and was exiled in 39 after her husband's death.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#29 29].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula seized Nero's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt, [[Domitia Lepida]], who was the mother of [[Valeria Messalina]], Claudius's third wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-6&quot;/&gt;
Caligula, his wife [[Caesonia]] and their infant daughter [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] were murdered on 24 January 41.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]], [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; These events led [[Claudius]], Caligula's uncle, to become emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 3|XIX.3.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius allowed Agrippina to return from exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-6&quot;/&gt;

Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria Messalina.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-claudius-26&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#26 26].&lt;/ref&gt; His previous marriages produced three children including a son, Drusus, who died at a young age.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-claudius-27&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#27 27].&lt;/ref&gt; He had two children with Messalina – [[Claudia Octavia]] (born 40) and Britannicus (born 41).&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-claudius-27&quot;/&gt; Messalina was executed by Claudius in the year 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-claudius-26&quot;/&gt;

In 49 AD, Claudius married a fourth time, to Nero's mother Agrippina, despite her being his niece.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-claudius-27&quot;/&gt; To aid Claudius politically, young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the name '''Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus''' (see [[adoption in Rome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#25|XII.25]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero was older than his stepbrother Britannicus, and thus became heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#26|XII.26]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xii-41&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#41|XII.41]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[proconsul]], entered and first addressed the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], made joint public appearances with Claudius, and was featured in coinage.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xii-41&quot;/&gt; In 53, he married his stepsister Claudia Octavia.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#58|XII.58]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor (54–68 AD)==

===Early rule===
[[File:Nerón y Agripina.jpg|thumb|335x335px|Nero and [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]]. Agrippina crowns her young son Nero with a laurel wreath. She carries a [[cornucopia]], symbol of fortune and plenty, and he wears the armour and cloak of a Roman commander, with a helmet on the ground at his feet. The scene refers to Nero's accession as emperor in 54 AD and is dated before 59 AD when Nero had Agrippina murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Information about this sculpture at the Museum of Aphrodisias, Turkey, where it is located.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Nero Agrippina aureus 54.png|thumb|300px|An [[Aureus]] of Nero and his mother, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], c. 54.]]
[[Claudius]] died in 54 and Nero, taking the name '''Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''', was established as Emperor. Though accounts vary, many ancient historians state [[Agrippina the younger|Agrippina]] poisoned Claudius.&lt;ref name=&quot;agrippina&quot;/&gt; According to [[Pliny the Elder]], she used poison mushrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3578208 On the Mushroom that Deified the Emperor Claudius]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how much Nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio's and Suetonius' accounts claim Nero knew of the murder, Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#35 LXI.35], Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#33 33]; Tacitus' and Josephus' accounts only mention Agrippina, Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 12#65|XII.65]], Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:Suetonius wrote &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor's death, he was at least privy to it, as he openly admitted; for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms, the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius, as &quot;the food of the gods,&quot; as the Greek proverb has it. At any rate, after Claudius' death he vented on him every kind of insult, in act and word, charging him now with folly and now with cruelty; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased &quot;to play the fool&quot; among mortals, lengthening the first syllable of the word ''morari'',&lt;ref&gt;The verb ''morari'' means &quot;to remain&quot;, while ''mōrari'' means &quot;to play the fool&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a dotard. Finally, he neglected to enclose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#33 Suetonius • Life of Nero&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Suetonius; Nero became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius' death was made known,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html Book LXI #3 P39]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#33 #8 P100]&lt;/ref&gt; making him the youngest emperor at that time &lt;ref&gt;. Augustus was 35, Tiberius was 56, Caligula was 25 and Claudius was 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, what Suetonius may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth, also listed by Suetonius, would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius' death. Tacitus, in book XIII of his Annals, describes Nero as being 'scarcely out of his boyhood' at the time he became emperor. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother, Agrippina, his tutor [[Seneca the younger|Lucius Annaeus Seneca]], and the Praetorian Prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], especially in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio claims &quot;At first Agrippina managed for him all the business of the empire&quot;, then Seneca and Burrus &quot;took the rule entirely into their own hands,&quot;, but &quot;after the death of Britannicus, Seneca and Burrus no longer gave any careful attention to the public business&quot; in 55, Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#3 LXI.3–7].&lt;/ref&gt; Other tutors were less often mentioned, such as [[Alexander of Aegae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jowett|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Jowett|title=Alexander of Aegae|editor=William Smith|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]|volume=1|pages=110–111|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=Boston|year=1867|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0119.html|editor-link=William Smith (lexicographer) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very early in Nero's rule, problems arose from competition for influence between Agrippina and Nero's two main advisers, Seneca and Burrus. Agrippina also attempted to influence the young Nero. Agrippina also as mentioned the ancient sources as &quot;scheming for her son (Nero)&quot;. This scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them. It is extremely unusual to see a women's face on a coin in the ancient world. It is because of this position of power Agrippina felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in Nero's court as he offered the advice Nero wanted to hear unlike his mother.

In 54, Agrippina tried to sit down next to Nero while he met with an Armenian envoy, but Seneca stopped her and prevented a scandalous scene&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-5&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#5|XIII.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; (as it was unimaginable at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business). Nero's friends also mistrusted Agrippina and told Nero to beware of his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-13&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#13|XIII.13]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to [[Claudia Octavia|Octavia]] and entered into an affair with [[Claudia Acte]], a former slave.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#12|XIII.12]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 55, Agrippina attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss Acte. Nero, with the support of Seneca, resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-14&quot;/&gt;

With Agrippina's influence over her son severed, she reportedly began pushing for Britannicus, Nero's stepbrother, to become emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-14&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#14|XIII.14]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly fourteen-year-old Britannicus, heir-designate prior to Nero's adoption, was still legally a minor, but was approaching legal adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-14&quot;/&gt; According to Tacitus, Agrippina hoped that with her support, Britannicus, being the blood son of Claudius, would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-14&quot;/&gt; However, the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55, the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#16|XIII.16]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero claimed that Britannicus died from an epileptic seizure, but ancient historians all claim Britannicus' death came from Nero's poisoning him. Supposedly, he enlisted the services of [[Locusta]], a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons. She devised a mixture to kill Britannicus, but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave, Nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable. Locusta then devised a new concoction that she promised would &quot;kill swifter than a viper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LXI.7&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#16|XIII.16]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.2]]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#33 33]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#7 LXI.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

Her promise was fulfilled after Britannicus consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine, which had already been tasted, and succumbed within minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;LXI.7&quot;/&gt; After the death of Britannicus, Agrippina was accused of slandering Octavia and Nero ordered her out of the imperial residence.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#18|XIII.18–21]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matricide and consolidation of power===
[[Image:Nero and Poppaea Sabina.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Coin of Nero and [[Poppaea Sabina]]]]

Over time, Nero became progressively more powerful, freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne. In 55, he removed [[Pallas (freedman)|Marcus Antonius Pallas]], an ally of Agrippina, from his position in the treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-14&quot;/&gt; Pallas, along with [[Burrus]], was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix|Faustus Sulla]] to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#23|XIII.23]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the younger|Seneca]] was accused of having relations with Agrippina and embezzlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxi-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#10 LXI.10].&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca succeeded in having himself, Pallas and Burrus acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxi-10&quot;/&gt; According to [[Cassius Dio]], at this time, Seneca and Burrus reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#7 LXI.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 58, Nero became romantically involved with [[Poppaea Sabina]], the wife of his friend and future emperor [[Otho]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-46&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#46|XIII.46]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly because a marriage to Poppaea and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#1|XIV.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Alexis, &quot;Whatever Happened to Lady Agrippina?&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'', 1969, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, according to [[Suetonius]], Poppaea did not divorce her husband until after Agrippina's death, making it unlikely that the already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Otho 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians theorize that Nero's execution of Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set [[Rubellius Plautus]] on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|1955|p=202}}; Silana accuses Agrippina of plotting to bring up Plautus in 55, Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#19|XIII.19]]; Silana is recalled from exile after Agrippina's power waned, Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#12|XIV.12]]; Plautus is exiled in 60, Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#22|XIV.22]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Suetonius]], Nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck planned by his freedman tutor [[Anicetus (admiral)|Anicetus]], which took the life of her friend, [[Acerronia Polla]], but when Agrippina survived, he had her executed by Anicetus and framed it as a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#34 34].&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is also recorded by Tacitus.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, &quot;The Annals&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 62, Nero's adviser, [[Burrus]], died.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#51|XIV.51]].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#52|XIV.52]].&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire from public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#53|XIV.53]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero divorced and banished [[Claudia Octavia|Octavia]] on grounds of infertility, leaving him free to marry the pregnant Poppaea.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-60&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#60|XIV.60]].&lt;/ref&gt; After public protests, Nero was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile,&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-60&quot;/&gt; but she was executed shortly after her return.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#64|XIV.64]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero also was reported to have kicked Poppaea to death in 65 before she could have his second child.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.216. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern historians, noting Suetonius, Tacitus and Cassius Dio's possible bias against Nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events, postulate that Poppaea may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Rudich, Vasily, ''Political Dissidence Under Nero'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#48|XIV.48]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate ruled that Antistius, a praetor, should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party. Later, Nero ordered the exile of Fabricius Veiento who slandered the Senate in a book.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#49|XIV.49]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]] began in this year. To consolidate power, Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]], Rubellius Plautus and Faustus Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#65|XIV.65]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, Nero &quot;showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whomsoever he pleased&quot; during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#37 37].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero's consolidation of power also included a slow usurping of authority from the Senate. In 54, Nero promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus-Annals&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#4|XIII.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the [[Pisonian conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#51|XV.51]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other relationships ===
When Nero's wife [[Poppaea Sabina]] died in 65, Nero went into deep mourning. Her body was not cremated, it was stuffed with spices, embalmed and put in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]].  She was given a [[state funeral]]. Nero praised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors. It is said that Nero &quot;burned ten years' worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Donato and Seefried (1989), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 66, he married [[Statilia Messalina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Champlin145&quot; /&gt; She was already married when she became Nero's mistress in 65 AD, with Statilia's husband being driven to suicide in 66, so Nero could marry Statilia. She was one of the few of Nero's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign.

In 67, Nero ordered a young [[freedman]], [[Sporus]], to be castrated and then married him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Champlin145&quot;&gt;Champlin, 2005, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suetonius&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-nero-rolfe.html Ancient History Sourcebook: Suetonius: De Vita Caesarum--Nero, c. 110 C.E.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio&quot;&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html Cassius Dio Roman History: LXII, 28 - LXIII, 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;Smith, 1849, p.897&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dion Cassius]], Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina, and Nero even called him by his dead wife's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |author=Smith, William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |publisher=C.

===Administrative policies===
[[Image:Nero charity.jpg|thumb|320px|Coin showing Nero distributing charity to a citizen. c. 64–66.]]
Over the course of his reign, Nero often made rulings that pleased the lower class. Nero was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#53 53]; Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' Vol. I, Chap. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus-Annals&quot;/&gt; In this first year, he forbade others to refer to him with regard to enactments, for which he was praised by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xii-25&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#25|XIII.25]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero was known for spending his time visiting brothels and taverns during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xii-25&quot;/&gt;

In 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was [[Roman consul|consul]] four times between 55 and 60. During this period, some ancient historians speak fairly well of Nero and contrast it with his later rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]] mentions [[Trajan]]'s praise of Nero's first five or so years. [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm Aurelius Victor ''The Style of Life and the Manners of the Imperitors'' 5]; The unknown author of ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' also mentions Trajan's praise of the first five or so years of Nero [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0210/_P2.HTM Auctor incertus ''Epitome De Caesarbius'' 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Nero, restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-28&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#28|XIII.28]].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, fees for lawyers were limited.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#17 17].&lt;/ref&gt; There was a discussion in the Senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class, and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of revoking freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#26|XIII.26]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#27|XIII.27]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household. Despite riots from the people, Nero supported the Senate on their measure, and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law. However, he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#45|XIV.45]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor, Nero transferred collection authority to lower commissioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-28&quot;/&gt; Nero banned any magistrate or procurator from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#31|XIII.31]].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there were many impeachments and removals of government officials along with arrests for extortion and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#30|XIII.30]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#18|XIV.18]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#40|XIV.40]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#46|XIV.46]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly taxed, Nero attempted to repeal all indirect taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-50&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#50|XIII.50]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-50&quot;/&gt; As a compromise, taxes were cut from 4.5% to 2.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-51&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#51|XIII.51]].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, secret government tax records were ordered to become public.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-51&quot;/&gt; To lower the cost of food imports, merchant ships were declared tax-exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-51&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Remains of Nero's Isthmus Canal in 1881.jpg|thumb|350px|Nero's abandoned [[Isthmus of Corinth|Corinth canal]].]]
In imitation of the Greeks, Nero built a number of gymnasiums and theatres.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-20&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#20|XIV.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; Enormous gladiatorial shows were also held.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-12&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero also established the [[quinquennial Neronia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-12&quot;/&gt; The festival included games, poetry, and theater. Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to immorality.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-20&quot;/&gt; Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-21&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#21|XIV.21]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-21&quot;/&gt;

In 64, [[Great Fire of Rome|Rome burned]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.38&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#38|XV.38]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero enacted a public relief effort&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.38&quot;/&gt; as well as significant reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-43&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#43|XV.43]].&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other major construction projects occurred in Nero's late reign. Nero had the marshes of Ostia filled with rubble from the fire. He erected the large [[Domus Aurea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus-Annals-15&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#42|XV.42]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 67, Nero attempted to have a canal dug at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 10|III.10.10]],Werner, Walter: &quot;The largest ship trackway in ancient times: the Diolkos of the Isthmus of Corinth, Greece, and early attempts to build a canal&quot;, The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 26, No. 2 (1997), pp. 98–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State's budget.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 16#3|XVI.3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to rebuild Rome was immense, requiring funds the state treasury did not have. Nero devalued the [[Roman currency]] for the first time in the Empire's history. He reduced the weight of the [[denarius]] from 84 per [[Roman pound]] to 96 (3.85&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.35&amp;nbsp;grams). He also reduced the silver purity from 99.5% to 93.5%—the silver weight dropping from 3.83&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.4&amp;nbsp;grams. Furthermore, Nero reduced the weight of the [[aureus]] from 40 per Roman pound to 45 (8&amp;nbsp;grams to 7.2&amp;nbsp;grams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|title=Roman Currency of the Principate|publisher=Tulane University|date=|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 62 and 67, according to [[Plinius the Elder]] and Seneca, Nero promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the [[Nile River]]. It was the first exploration of equatorial [[Africa]] from Europe in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2bJP8zLR_UC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=nero+expedition+to+ethiopia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tc0NB0Oqt1&amp;sig=ros4Zz0Ayze9-xtWGH90ULSOsUs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=htBkTLvtEoP-8AaHlqXeCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=nero%20expedition%20to%20ethiopia&amp;f=false|title=Derek A. Welsby: Nero expedition to Nile sources|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nero's expedition up the Nile failed because water plants had clogged the river, denying Nero's vessels access to the [[Sudd]] of present-day [[South Sudan]].

The economic policy of Nero is a point of debate among scholars. According to ancient historians, Nero's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under Nero left Italy &quot;thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money&quot; with &quot;the provinces ruined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#31 31].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#45 XV.45]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians, though, note that the period was riddled with deflation and that it is likely that Nero's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Mary Elizabeth Kelly &quot;Nero's New Deal,&quot; ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 102, (1971), p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) ===
{{Main|Great Fire of Rome}}
The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64. The fire started at the southeastern end of the [[Circus Maximus]] in shops selling flammable goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.38&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hubert Robert - The Fire of Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|Artwork depicting the [[Great Fire of Rome]].]]

The extent of the fire is uncertain. According to [[Tacitus]], who was nine at the time of the fire, it spread quickly and burned for over five days.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-40&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#40|XV.40]]; Suetonius says the fire raged for six days and seven nights, Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero 38; A pillar set by Domitius states the fire burned for nine days.&lt;/ref&gt; It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-40&quot;/&gt; The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about it in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/17*.html#1 XVII.1.5], Pliny mentions trees that lasted &quot;down to the Emperor Nero's conflagration&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians who lived through the period (including [[Josephus]], [[Dio Chrysostom]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Epictetus]]) make no mention of it in what remains of their work.

It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire—whether accident or [[arson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.38&quot;/&gt; [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] favor Nero as the [[arson]]ist, so he could build a palatial complex. Tacitus mentions that Christians confessed to the crime, but it is not known whether these confessions were induced by torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-44&quot;&gt;Tacitus ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|XV.44]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, accidental fires were common in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal writes that Rome suffered from perpetual fires and falling houses Juvenal, ''Satires'' [http://www.vroma.org/~araia/satire3.html 3.7, 3.195, 3.214].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rome suffered other large fires in 69&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-I.2&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in 80.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#8 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said by Suetonius and Cassius Dio that Nero sang the &quot;[[Sack of Ilium]]&quot; in stage costume while the city burned.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#38 38]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html#16 LXII.16].&lt;/ref&gt; Popular legend claims that Nero played the [[fiddle]] at the time of the fire, an [[anachronism]] based merely on the concept of the [[lyre]], a stringed instrument associated with Nero and his performances. (The fiddle wasn't invented until the 10th century.) Tacitus's account, however, has Nero in Antium at the time of the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-39&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#39|XV.39]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus also said that Nero playing his lyre and singing while the city burned was only rumor.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-39&quot;/&gt;

According to Tacitus, upon hearing news of the fire, Nero returned to Rome to organize a relief effort, which he paid for from his own funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-39&quot;/&gt; Nero's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze, spending days searching the debris without even his bodyguards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} After the fire, Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless, and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-39&quot;/&gt;

In the wake of the fire, he made a new urban development plan. Houses after the fire were spaced out, built in brick, and faced by [[porticos]] on wide roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-43&quot;/&gt; Nero also built a new palace complex known as the [[Domus Aurea]] in an area cleared by the fire. This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall statue of himself, the [[Colossus of Nero]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus-Annals-15&quot;/&gt; The size of this complex is debated (from 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;acres).&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Leland M.

Tacitus, in [[Tacitus on Christ|one of the earliest non-Christian references to the origins of Christianity]], notes that the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held Nero responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-44&quot;/&gt; To deflect blame, Nero targeted Christians. He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs, while others were crucified and burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-44&quot;/&gt;

===Public performances===
[[Image:As-Nero-Ara pacis-RIC 0562.jpg|thumb|300px|Nero coin, c. 66. [[Ara Pacis]] on the reverse.]]

Nero enjoyed driving a one-horse chariot, singing to the lyre and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#14|XIV.14]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#16|XIV.16]].&lt;/ref&gt; He even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus II, ''Life of Apollonius'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_4_36.html#§39 4.39]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Vitellius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html#11 11].&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Nero only performed for a private audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.33&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#22|XV.33]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 64 AD., Nero began singing in public in [[Naples|Neapolis]] in order to improve his popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.33&quot;/&gt; He also sang at the second [[quinquennial Neronia]] in 65.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'' Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#21 21].&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that Nero craved the attention,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#33 33].&lt;/ref&gt; but historians also write that Nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate, his inner circle and the people.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 16#4|XVI.4]]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Vitellius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitelius*.html#11 11]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#10 10], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#21 21].&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform, calling it shameful.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#15|XIV.15]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#19 LXI.19].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was persuaded to participate in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus II, ''Life of Apollonius'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_5_06.html#§7 5.7].&lt;/ref&gt; As a competitor, Nero raced a ten-horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-24&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#24 24].&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed as an actor and a singer.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#25 25].&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nero faltered in his racing (in one case, dropping out entirely before the end) and acting competitions,&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-24&quot;/&gt; he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them when he returned to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-nero-24&quot;/&gt; The victories are attributed to Nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#23 23], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#24 24].&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and peace with Parthia===
{{details|Roman-Parthian War of 58–63}}
Shortly after Nero's accession to the throne in 54, the Roman [[vassal]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|kingdom of Armenia]] overthrew their [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] prince [[Rhadamistus]] and he was replaced with the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-7&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#7|XIII.7]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as a Parthian invasion of Roman territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-7&quot;/&gt; There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#8|XIII.8]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#9|XIII.9]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#10|XIII.10]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Parthian Empire-fr.png|thumb|350px|The [[Parthian Empire]] c. 60. Nero's peace deal with Parthia was a political victory at home and made him beloved in the east.]]
The peace did not last and full-scale war broke out in 58. The Parthian king [[Vologases I of Parthia|Vologases I]] refused to remove his brother Tiridates from Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#42|XIII.42]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians began a full-scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-46&quot;/&gt; Commander Corbulo responded and repelled most of the Parthian army that same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-55&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#55|XIII.55]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tiridates retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiii-55&quot;/&gt;

Nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#56|XIII.56]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]], a Cappadocian noble raised in Rome, was installed by Nero as the new ruler of Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-36&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#36|XIV.36]].&lt;/ref&gt; Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xiv-36&quot;/&gt;

In 62, Tigranes invaded the Parthian province of [[Adiabene]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#1|XV.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Rome and Parthia were at war and this continued until 63. Parthia began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-4&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#4|XV.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; Corbulo tried to convince Nero to continue the war, but Nero opted for a peace deal instead.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#16|XV.16]].&lt;/ref&gt; There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#18|XV.18]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a deal where Tiridates again became the Armenian king, but was crowned in Rome by Emperor Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#29|XV.29]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, the [[List of Armenian Kings#Arshakuni (Arsacid) Kings of Armenia|king of Armenia]] was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Tiridates was forced to come to Rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-xv.38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/63*.html#2 LXIII.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for Nero politically.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxii-23&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html#23 LXII.23].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Parthians as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxii-23&quot;/&gt; The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor [[Trajan]] of Rome invaded Armenia in 114.

===Other major power struggles and rebellions===
[[Image:Nero pushkin.jpg|thumb|220px|A plaster bust of Nero, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow.]]
The war with Parthia was not Nero's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18]; Marcus Annaeus Lucanus ''Pharsalia'' (Civil War) (c. 65)[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/pcwar10.txt].&lt;/ref&gt; Like many emperors, Nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire.

;British Revolt of 60–61 (Boudica's Uprising)
{{Further|Boudica#Boudica's Uprising}}
In 60, a major rebellion broke out in the province of [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#29|XIV.29]].&lt;/ref&gt; While the governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona ([[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]]) from the druids, the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#31|XIV.31]].&lt;/ref&gt; Boudica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of Paulinus could return, receive reinforcements, and quell the rebellion in 61.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#31|XIV.31–38]].&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing Paulinus himself would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced him with the more passive [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#39|XIV.39]].&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Pisonian Conspiracy of 65
{{Main|Pisonian conspiracy}}
In 65, [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]], a Roman statesman, organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper, a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#49|XV.49]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tacitus, many conspirators wished to &quot;rescue the state&quot; from the emperor and restore the [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#50|XV.50]].&lt;/ref&gt; The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero's secretary, [[Epaphroditos]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#55|XV.55]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#70|XV.70]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nero's previous advisor, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#60|XV.60–62]].&lt;/ref&gt;

;The First Jewish War of 66–70
{{main|First Jewish-Roman War}}
In 66, there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book II#Chapter 13|II.13.7]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 67, Nero dispatched [[Vespasian]] to restore order.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 1|III.1.3]].&lt;/ref&gt; This revolt was eventually put down in 70, after Nero's death.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book IV#Chapter 10|VI.10.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second [[Temple of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 1|VII.1.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The revolt of Vindex and Galba and the death of Nero===

[[Image:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|thumb|200px|A marble bust of Nero, Antiquarium of the [[Palatine]].]]
In March 68, [[Vindex|Gaius Julius Vindex]], the governor of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], rebelled against Nero's tax policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassius-22&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/63*.html#22 LXIII.22].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donahue.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Virginius Rufus|Lucius Verginius Rufus]], the governor of [[Germania Superior]], was ordered to put down Vindex's rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxiii-24&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/63*.html#24 LXIII.24].&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province, Vindex called upon [[Galba|Servius Sulpicius Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], to join the rebellion and further, to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch-galba-5&quot;&gt;Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives'', Life of Galba [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Galba*.html#5 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of Vesontio]] in May 68, Verginius' forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lxiii-24&quot;/&gt; However, after putting down this one rebel, Verginius' legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor. Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.

While Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy. The prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Nymphidius Sabinus|Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus]], also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for Galba.

In response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': &quot;Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?&quot; Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to [[Parthia]], throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences &quot;and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt&quot;. Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#47 47].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, &quot;Have I neither friend nor foe?&quot; and ran out as if to throw himself into the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt;

Returning, Nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], offered his villa, located 4 miles outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal [[freedman|freedmen]], [[Epaphroditos]], [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], [[Neophytus (freedman)|Neophytus]], and [[Sporus]], reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.

At this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the Forum. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#72|XV.72]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for [[forced suicide|suicide]], pacing up and down muttering &quot;Qualis artifex pereo&quot; which translates to English as &quot;What an artist dies in me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Buckley |first1 = Emma |last2 = Dinter |first2 = Martin T. |title = A Companion to the Neronian Age |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |year = 2013 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&amp;dq |accessdate = 2013-10-28 |isbn = 978-1-118-31659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing his nerve, he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself. At last, the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end. However, he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary, [[Epaphroditos]], to perform the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Bunson |first1 = Matthew |title = Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire |publisher = Infobase Publishing |year = 2009 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T5tic2VunRoC&amp;dq |accessdate = 2013-10-28 |isbn = 978-1-4381-1027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When one of the horsemen entered, upon his seeing Nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain. Nero's final words were &quot;Too late! This is fidelity!&quot; He died on 9 June 68, the anniversary of the death of Octavia, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarbi, in what is now the [[Villa Borghese]] ([[Pincian Hill]]) area of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49 49].&lt;/ref&gt;

With his death, the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] ended. The Senate, when news of his death reached Rome, posthumously declared Nero a public enemy to appease the coming Galba (as the Senate had initially declared Galba as a public enemy) and proclaimed Galba the new emperor.  Chaos would ensue in the [[year of the Four Emperors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-I.2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Piranesi-3014.jpg|thumb|250px|The alleged Tomb of Nero.]]
According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio, the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/63*.html 63].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#57 57].&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus, though, describes a more complicated political environment. Tacitus mentions that Nero's death was welcomed by Senators, nobility and the upper class.&lt;ref name=&quot;histories-i-4&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#4|I.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; The lower-class, slaves, frequenters of the arena and the theater, and &quot;those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero&quot;, on the other hand, were upset with the news.&lt;ref name=&quot;histories-i-4&quot;/&gt; Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings, as they had allegiance to Nero, but were bribed to overthrow him.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-I.5&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#5|I.5]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern sources, namely Philostratus II and [[Apollonius of Tyana]], mention that Nero's death was mourned as he &quot;restored the liberties of [[Roman Greece|Hellas]] with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus II, ''The Life of Apollonius'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_5_41.html#§41 5.41].&lt;/ref&gt; and that he &quot;held our liberties in his hand and respected them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Apollonius to Emperor Vespasian, Philostratus II, ''The Life of Apollonius'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_5_41.html#§41 5.41].&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship generally holds that, while the Senate and more well-off individuals welcomed Nero's death, the general populace was &quot;loyal to the end and beyond, for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;M. T. Griffin, Nero (1984), p. 186; Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' Vol. I, Chap. III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero's name was erased from some monuments, in what Edward Champlin regards as an &quot;outburst of private zeal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin (2003), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures; according to Eric R. Varner, over fifty such images survive.&lt;ref name=pollini&gt;John Pollini (September 2006), Review of ''Mutilation and Transformation: Damnatio Memoriae and Roman Imperial Portraiture'' by Eric R. Varner, ''[[The Art Bulletin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously (see [[damnatio memoriae]]).&lt;ref name=pollini/&gt; Champlin, however, doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin (2003), pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nero-nancy.jpg|190px|thumb|[[Apotheosis]] of Nero, c. after 68. Artwork portraying Nero rising to divine status after his death.]]

The civil war during the [[year of the Four Emperors]] was described by ancient historians as a troubling period.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-I.2&quot;/&gt; According to Tacitus, this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline, as Nero and those before him could.&lt;ref name=&quot;histories-i-4&quot;/&gt; [[Galba]] began his short reign with the execution of many allies of Nero and possible future enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#6|I.6]].&lt;/ref&gt; One such notable enemy included [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], who claimed to be the son of Emperor [[Caligula]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives'', The Life of Galba [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Galba*.html#9 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otho]] overthrew Galba. Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero's and resembled him somewhat in temperament.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#13|I.13]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-otho-7&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Otho [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Otho*.html#7 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Otho used &quot;Nero&quot; as a surname and reerected many statues to Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-otho-7&quot;/&gt; [[Vitellius]] overthrew Otho. Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Vitellius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html#11 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nero's suicide in 68, there was a widespread belief, especially in the eastern provinces, that he was not dead and somehow would return.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#57 57]; Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#8|II.8]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#19 LXVI.19].&lt;/ref&gt; This belief came to be known as the [[Nero Redivivus Legend]].

The legend of Nero's return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero's death. [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422.&lt;ref name=&quot;augustine&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'' .[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XX.19.html XX.19.3].&lt;/ref&gt;

At least [[pseudo-Neros|three Nero imposters]] emerged leading rebellions. The first, who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor, appeared in 69 during the reign of Vitellius.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-II.8&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#8|II.8]].&lt;/ref&gt; After persuading some to recognize him, he was captured and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-II.8&quot;/&gt; Sometime during the reign of [[Titus]] (79–81), another impostor appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero but he, too, was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#19 LXVI.19].&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of [[Domitian]], there was a third pretender. He was supported by the Parthians, who only reluctantly gave him up,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caears'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#57 57].&lt;/ref&gt; and the matter almost came to war.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-I.2&quot;/&gt;

==Physical appearance==
In his book ''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', [[Suetonius]] describes Nero as &quot;about the average height, his body marked with spots and [[Body odor|malodorous]], his hair light blond, his features regular rather than attractive, his eyes blue and somewhat weak, his neck over thick, his belly prominent, and his legs very slender.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Suetonius|authorlink=Suetonius|title=The Lives of Twelve Caesars|chapter=Life of Nero, 51|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#51|ref=Suetonius, Life of Nero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The history of Nero's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero. These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical, either overly critical or praising of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.3]]; Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#10|10]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#2|XIV.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.13]].&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the contemporary historians are known by name. [[Fabius Rusticus]], [[Cluvius Rufus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; There were also pro-Nero histories, but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]], who were all of the senatorial class. Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero's death. These sources contradict on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of [[Claudius]], the death of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.

A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

;Cassius Dio
[[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155–229) was the son of [[Cassius Apronianus]], a Roman senator. He passed the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under [[Commodus]] and governor of Smyrna after the death of [[Septimius Severus]]; and afterwards suffect consul around 205, and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.

Books 61–63 of Dio's ''Roman History'' describe the reign of Nero. Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by [[John Xiphilinus]], an 11th-century monk.

;Dio Chrysostom
[[Dio Chrysostom]] (c. 40–120), a Greek philosopher and historian, wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely. They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared:

{{quote|Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned, there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time, seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive. And the great majority do believe that he still is, although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, ''Discourse'' XXI, On Beauty.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Epictetus
[[Epictetus]] (c. 55–135) was the slave to Nero's scribe [[Epaphroditos]]. He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero's character in his work, but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule. He describes Nero as a spoiled, angry and unhappy man.

;Josephus
[[Image:Josephusbust.jpg|thumb|The historian [[Josephus]] (c. 37–100) accused other historians of slandering Nero.]]
The historian [[Josephus]] (c. 37–100), while calling Nero a tyrant, was also the first to mention bias against Nero. Of other historians, he said:

{{quote|But I omit any further discourse about these affairs; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour, as having received benefits from him; while others, out of hatred to him, and the great ill-will which they bore him, have so impudently raved against him with their lies, that they justly deserve to be condemned. Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero, since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time, even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred, since those writers lived a long time after them.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.3]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Lucan
Though more of a poet than historian, [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucanus]] (c. 39–65) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero's rule. He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife. Ironically, he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/pcwar10.txt ''Pharsalia'' (Civil War) (''c.'' 65)].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Philostratus
[[Philostratus]] II &quot;the Athenian&quot; (c. 172–250) spoke of Nero in the [[Life of Apollonius Tyana]] (Books 4–5). Though he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero, he speaks of others' positive reception of Nero in the East.

;Pliny the Elder
The history of Nero by [[Pliny the Elder]] (c. 24–79) did not survive. Still, there are several references to Nero in Pliny's ''Natural Histories''. Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an &quot;enemy of mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html#viii VII.8.46].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Plutarch
[[Plutarch]] (c. 46–127) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho. Nero is portrayed as a tyrant, but those that replace him are not described as better.

;Seneca the Younger
It is not surprising that [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (c. 4 BC–65), Nero's teacher and advisor, writes very well of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10001/10001-h/10001-h.htm ''Apocolocyntosis'' 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Suetonius
{{Main|Lives of the Twelve Caesars}}
[[Suetonius]] (c. 69–130) was a member of the equestrian order, and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence. While in this position, Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors, accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects.

;Tacitus
{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}
The ''Annals'' by [[Tacitus]] (c. 56–117) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero, despite being incomplete after the year 66. Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:

{{quote|The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tacitus was the son of a [[Promagistrate|procurator]], who married into the elite family of Agricola. He entered his political life as a senator after Nero's death and, by Tacitus' own admission, owed much to Nero's rivals. Realising that this bias may be apparent to others, Tacitus protests that his writing is true.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''History'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

; Girolamo Cardano
In 1562 [[Girolamo Cardano]] published in Basel his ''Encomium Neronis'', which was one of the first historical references of the [[Modern era]] to portray Nero in a positive light.

==Nero and religion==

===Jewish tradition===
At the end of 66, conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in [[Jerusalem]] and Caesarea. According to the [[Talmud]], Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions. All the arrows landed in the city. He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day. The child responded, &quot;I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel&quot; ([[Ezekiel|Ez.]] [http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Eze-25.html 25,14]). Nero became terrified, believing that God wanted the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to be destroyed, but would punish the one to carry it out. Nero said, &quot;He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me,&quot; whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, [[Treatise|tractate]] [[Gittin|Gitin]] 56a-b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vespasian]] was then dispatched to put down the rebellion.

The Talmud adds that the sage [[Reb Meir Baal HaNess]], a prominent supporter of the [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]] [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|rebellion]] against Roman rule, was a descendant of Nero.

Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Nero's alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, Benjamin (2004) The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity pp. 440–491. Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy: his only recorded child, [[Claudia Augusta]], died aged 4 months.

===Christian tradition===
[[Image:Siemiradzki Christian Dirce.jpg|thumb|400px|''A Christian Dirce'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]. A Christian woman is martyred in this re-enactment of the myth of [[Dirce]].]]

[[File:Siemiradski Fackeln.jpg|thumb|Nero's Torches]]
Non-Christian historian [[Tacitus]] describes Nero extensively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of 64.&lt;ref name=&quot;annals-xv-44&quot;/&gt; [[Suetonius]] also mentions Nero punishing Christians, though he does so because they are &quot;given to a new and mischievous superstition&quot; and does not connect it with the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#16 Life of Nero, chapter 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155–230) was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians. He wrote, &quot;Examine your records. There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''Apologeticum'', lost text quoted in [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm], [[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', II.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lactantius]] (c. 240–320) also said that Nero &quot;first persecuted the servants of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lactantius&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-07/anf07-15.htm Lactantius, ''Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died'' II].&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Sulpicius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sulpiciusseveruschron2.html Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronica'' II.28].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Suetonius writes that, &quot;since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [emperor [[Claudius]]] expelled them from Rome&quot; (&quot;''Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantis Roma expulit''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 25].&lt;/ref&gt; These expelled &quot;Jews&quot; may have been early Christians, although Suetonius is not explicit. Nor is the Bible explicit, calling Aquila of Pontus and his wife, Priscilla, both expelled from Italy at the time, &quot;Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[BibleWiki:Acts Chapter 18, Verse 2|Acts of the Apostles 18:2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reputed martyrdoms of Peter and Paul====
The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is the apocryphal [[Ascension of Isaiah]], a Christian writing from the 2nd century. It says, &quot;the slayer of his mother, who himself (even) this king, will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted. Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ascension&quot;&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ascension.html Ascension of Isaiah Chapter 4.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bishop]] [[Eusebius]] of [[Caesarea]] (c. 275–339) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'' II.25.5].&lt;/ref&gt; He states that Nero's persecution led to Peter and Paul's deaths, but that Nero did not give any specific orders. However, several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to [[Hispania]], before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspaul.html apocryphal Acts of Paul], in the [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html apocryphal Acts of Peter], in the [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html First Epistle of Clement 5:6], and in [http://www.bible-researcher.com/muratorian.html The Muratorian Fragment].&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter is first said to have been [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]] in Rome during Nero's reign (but not by Nero) in the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]] (c. 200).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter''].&lt;/ref&gt; The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God's command not to persecute any more Christians.

By the 4th century, a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]] wrote that Nero &quot;crucified Peter, and slew Paul.&quot;, Lactantius, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-07/anf07-15.htm ''Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died'' II]; [[John Chrysostom]] wrote Nero knew Paul personally and had him killed, John Chrysostom, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1907.htm ''Concerning Lowliness of Mind'' 4]; [[Sulpicius Severus]] says Nero killed Peter and Paul, Sulpicius Severus, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sulpiciusseveruschron2.html ''Chronica'' II.28–29].&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Antichrist====
{{Main|Antichrist|The Beast (Revelation)|Number of the Beast}}

The [[Sibylline Oracles]], Book 5 and 8, written in the 2nd century, speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/index.htm ''Sibylline Oracles'' 5.361–376, 8.68–72, 8.531–157].&lt;/ref&gt; Within Christian communities, these writings, along with others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulpicius Severus]] and [[Victorinus of Pettau]] also say that Nero is the Antichrist, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sulpiciusseveruschron2.html Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronica'' II.28–29]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0712.htm Victorinus of Pettau, ''Commentary on the Apocalypse'' 17].&lt;/ref&gt; fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist. In 310, [[Lactantius]] wrote that Nero &quot;suddenly disappeared, and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the Sibylline verses&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lactantius&quot;/&gt;

In 422, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote about 2 Thessalonians 2:1–11, where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist. Though he rejects the theory, Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist. He wrote, &quot;so that in saying, 'For the mystery of iniquity doth already work,'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=60&amp;chapter=2&amp;verse=7&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse|title=2 Thessalonians 2:7 – Passage Lookup – King James Version|publisher=BibleGateway.com|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;augustine&quot;/&gt;

Some modern biblical scholars&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzzAFl2ONfAC&amp;pg=PA61 The Book of Revelation], Catherine A. Cory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SkOg-tEYbR4C&amp;pg=PA86 Revelation], Alan John Philip Garrow.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Delbert Hillers ([[Johns Hopkins University]]) of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] and the editors of the Oxford &amp; Harper Collins Study Bibles, contend that the number [[Number of the Beast|666]] in the [[Book of Revelation]] is a code for Nero,&lt;ref&gt;Hillers, Delbert, &quot;Rev. 13, 18 and a scroll from Murabba'at&quot;, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 170 (1963) 65.&lt;/ref&gt; a view that is also supported in [[Roman Catholic]] Biblical commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. Ed. Raymond E. Brown, Joseph A. Fitzmyer, and Roland E. Murphy. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1990. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Just, S.J., Ph.D.|first=Prof. Felix|title=''The Book of Revelation, Apocalyptic Literature, and Millennial Movements'', University of San Francisco, USF Jesuit Community|url=http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Apocalyptic.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galba''' {{lang-la|Servius Sulpicius Galba Caesar Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]:
:{{sqc|SERVIVS SVLPICIVS GALBA CAESAR AVGVSTVS}}
:{{IPA-la|ˈsɛr.wi.ʊs sʊɫˈpɪ.ki.ʊs ˈgaɫ.ba ˈkae̯.sar au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 December 3 BC – 15 January 69) pron. {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|v|i|ə|s|_|s|ʌ|l|ˈ|p|ɪ|ʃ|ə|s|_|ˈ|g|æ|l|b|ə}}, was [[Roman Emperor]] for seven months from 68 to 69. Galba was the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], and made a bid for the throne during the rebellion of [[Vindex|Julius Vindex]]. He was the first emperor of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] and the last emperor born in the First Century BC.

==Origins and family life==
He was born as '''Servius Sulpicius Galba''' near [[Terracina]], &quot;on the left as you go towards [[Fondi|Fundi]]&quot; in the words of [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=UrGdu3CwL2IC|page=248|text=on the left as you go towards Fundi}} Suetonius Tranquillus, The Lives Of The Caesars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his paternal grandfather (&quot;more eminent for his learning than for his rank — for he did not advance beyond the grade of praetor&quot; and who &quot;published a voluminous and painstaking history&quot;, and, according to Suetonius, predicted his rise to power),&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html#4 Suetonius, 4]&lt;/ref&gt; he was descended from [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (praetor)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]]. Galba's father attained the consulship, and although he was short, [[hunchback]]ed and only an indifferent speaker, was an industrious pleader at the [[bar (law)|bar]].

His mother was [[Mummia Achaica]], the granddaughter of [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus)|Lutatius Catulus]] (cos. 78) and great-granddaughter of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]]. They only had one other child, an elder son called [[Gaius Sulpicius Galba|Gaius]] who left Rome after squandering the greater part of his estate, and committed suicide because Tiberius dishonored him by preventing him from taking part in the allotment of the provinces in his year. His father married a second wife, [[Livia Ocellina]], a distant kinswoman of the empress Livia.  She later adopted Galba, so he took her names, remaining '''Lucius Livius Ocella Sulpicius Galba''' until becoming emperor.

His was a noble family, and he was a man of great wealth, but was unconnected by birth and only very, very remotely by [[adoption]] with any of the first six Caesars. In his early years he was regarded as a youth of remarkable abilities, and it is said that both [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] prophesied his future eminence ([[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+6.20 vi. 20]; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html#4 Suet. Galba&amp;nbsp;4]; Dio 57.19.4).

His wife, Aemilia Lepida, however, was connected by the marriages of some of her relatives to some of the Julii-Claudii. They had two sons, probably Gaius and Servius (most likely Livius Ocella Galba), who died during their father's life.  The elder son was born circa 25 AD.  Hardly anything is known about his life as he died young. He was engaged to his step-sister Antonia Postuma, but they never wed, which leads modern historians to believe that he died during this time. Their engagement is dated to 48, and that is generally believed to be his time of death.

The date of birth of the younger son occurred later than 25 but before 30. This Galba outlived his older brother. He was a quaestor in 58, but he was never seen in politics after that. His time of death is generally believed to be around 60 AD. Galba Minor was never married and had no children.&lt;ref&gt;The following quote is NOT in Suetonius and has been removed to a footnote until the citation can be corrected and/or verified. ... Suetonius mentions that &quot;Galba Minor had discovered his father's affair with a male slave and threatened to tell his step-mother, which led to death of him.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Suetonius]]'s description of Galba was that ''In sexual matters he was more inclined to males, and then none but the hard bodied and those past their prime''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Galba'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be the only case in Roman history where a named individual male is stated to prefer adult males.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'', Oxford, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public service ===
He became [[Praetor]] in 20, and [[Roman consul|consul]] in 33; he earned a reputation in the provinces of [[Gaul]], [[Germania]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and [[Hispania]] for his military capability, strictness and impartiality. On the death of [[Caligula]], he refused the invitation of his friends to make a bid for the empire, and loyally served [[Claudius]]. For the first half of [[Nero]]'s reign he lived in retirement, until 61, when the emperor bestowed on him the province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].

In the spring of 68, Galba was informed of Nero's intention to put him to death, and of the insurrection of [[Vindex|Julius Vindex]] in Gaul. He was at first inclined to follow the example of Vindex, but the defeat at Vesontio (Besançon) and suicide&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Galba 6.4''&lt;/ref&gt; of the latter renewed Galba's hesitation. It was said that the [[courtier]] [[Calvia Crispinilla]] was behind his defection from Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;abit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abitofhistory.net/html/rhw/body_files/c_body.htm |title=Calvia Crispinilla |publisher=A Bit of History |work=Women of History |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news that [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian]] [[Prefect]], had given him his favour revived Galba's spirits. Until now, he had only dared to call himself the [[Legatus|legate]] of the [[Roman Senate|senate]] and Roman people; after Nero's [[suicide]], he assumed the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', and marched straight for [[Rome]].

Following Nero's death, Nymphidius Sabinus sought to seize power prior to the arrival of Galba, but he could not win the loyalty of the Praetorian guard and was killed. Upon Galba's approach to the city in October, he was met by soldiers presenting demands; Galba replied by killing many of them.

==Emperor (June 68)==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

===Rule===
[[File:Bronze Galba MBA Lyon.JPG|thumb|Galba - [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]
Galba's primary concern during his brief reign was restoring state finances, and to this end he undertook a number of unpopular measures, the most dangerous was his refusal to pay the praetorians the reward promised in his name. Galba scorned the notion that soldiers should be &quot;[[bribery|bribed]]&quot; for their loyalty. He was notoriously cruel throughout the Empire; according to the historian [[Suetonius]], Galba levied massive taxes against areas that were slow to receive him as Emperor.&lt;ref name=Suetonius /&gt;

He also sentenced many to death without trial, and rarely accepted requests for citizenship.&lt;ref name=Suetonius /&gt; He further disgusted the populace by his meanness and dislike of pomp and display. Advanced age destroyed his energy, and he was entirely in the hands of favourites.&lt;ref name=Suetonius&gt;{{cite book|last=Suetonious|title=The Twelve Caesars|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-045516-8|pages=242–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these — [[Titus Vinius]], who became Galba's colleague as [[Roman consul|consul]], [[Cornelius Laco]], the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and Galba's [[freedman]] Icelus Marcianus — were said to virtually control the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suetonius&quot;/&gt; The three were called &quot;The Three [[Pedagogue]]s&quot; because of their influence on Galba. All this made the new emperor gravely unpopular.

During the later period of his provincial administration, Galba was indolent and apathetic, but this was due either to a desire not to attract Nero's notice or to the growing infirmities of age. [[Tacitus]] says all pronounced him worthy of the empire, until he became emperor (&quot;''omnium consensū cāpax imperiī nisi imperasset''&quot;).

===Military mutiny on the frontier===
On 1 January 69, two legions in [[Germania Superior]] refused to swear loyalty to Galba. They toppled his statues, demanding that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of [[Germania Inferior]] also rebelled and took the decision of who should be the next emperor into their own hands, proclaiming the governor of the province, [[Vitellius]], as Emperor.

This outbreak of revolt made Galba aware of his own unpopularity and of the general discontent. In order to check the rising storm, he adopted as his heir and successor [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus|L. Calpurnius Piso]]. The populace regarded the choice of successor as a sign of fear and the Praetorians were indignant, because the usual donative was not forthcoming.  Furthermore, [[M. Salvius Otho]], who was expecting to be adopted, was alienated by the choice of Piso.

===Assassination (January 69)===
Otho had governed [[Lusitania]] and was one of Galba's earliest supporters. He was disappointed at the selection of Piso and entered into communication with the discontented Praetorians, and he was hailed by them as their emperor on 15 January 69. Galba at once set out to meet the rebels, though he was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter. According to Suetonius, Galba prior to his death had put on a linen corset—although remarking that it had little protection against so many swords. &lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html Suetonius &quot;Galba&quot; Chapter 19]&lt;/ref&gt;He was met by a troop of Otho's cavalry and was killed near [[Lacus Curtius]]. One guard, [[centurion]] [[Sempronius Densus]], died defending him. Piso was killed shortly afterwards. According to [[Plutarch]], during Galba's last moments he offered his neck, and said, &quot;Strike, if it be for the good of the Romans!&quot;

After his death, Galba's head was brought to Otho, who gave it to his camp followers who paraded and mocked it—the camp followers' mocking was their angry response to a remark by Galba that his strength was unimpaired. The head was then bought by a freedman so he could throw it on the place where his former master had been executed on Galba's orders. Galba's steward buried both head and trunk in a tomb by the [[Aurelian Road]].

The future Emperor appears first as one of the most reckless and extravagant of the young nobles who surrounded [[Nero]].&lt;ref name=Suetonius&gt;{{cite book|last=Suetonius|title=The Twelve Caesars|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-045516-8|pages=255–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This friendship was brought to an end in 58 AD because of his wife, the noblewoman [[Poppaea Sabina]]. Otho introduced his beautiful wife to the Emperor upon Poppaea's insistence, who then began an affair that would eventually lead to her premature death. After securely establishing this position as his mistress, she divorced Otho and had the Emperor send him away as governor to the remote province of [[Lusitania]] (which is now parts of both modern [[Portugal]] and [[Extremadura]], Spain).

Otho remained in Lusitania for the next ten years, administering the province with a moderation unusual at the time.&lt;ref name=Suetonius /&gt; When in 68 AD his neighbor the future Emperor [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], rose in revolt against Nero, Otho accompanied him to [[Rome]]. Resentment at the treatment he had received from Nero may have impelled him to this course, but to this motive was added before long that of personal ambition.

Galba was childless and far advanced in years, and Otho, encouraged by the predictions of [[astrologer]]s, aspired to succeed him. He came to a secret agreement with Galba's [[favourite]], [[Titus Vinius]], agreeing to marry Vinius' daughter in exchange for his support. However, in January 69 AD, his hopes were dashed by Galba's formal adoption of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus]], whom Galba had previously named a recipient in his will.

=== Overthrow of Emperor Galba ===
After this, Otho decided to strike a bold blow. Desperate as was the state of his finances, thanks to his previous extravagance, he found the money needed to purchase the services of some twenty-three soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]]. On the morning of 15 January, only five days after Galba adopted Piso, Otho attended as usual to pay his respects to [[Galba]], and then hastily excused himself on account of private business and hurried from the [[Palatine Hill]] to meet his accomplices. He was then escorted to the Praetorian camp, where, after a few moments of surprise and indecision, he was saluted as Imperator.

With an imposing force he returned to the [[Roman Forum]], and at the foot of the [[Capitoline Hill]] encountered Galba, who, alarmed by rather vague rumors of treachery, was making his way through a dense crowd of wandering citizens towards the [[barracks]] of the guard. The [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] that was on duty at the Palatine, which had accompanied the Emperor, instantly deserted him. Galba, his newly adopted son Piso and others were brutally murdered by the Praetorians. The brief struggle over, Otho returned in triumph to the camp, and on the same day was duly invested by the [[Roman Senate|senators]] with the name of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], the tribunician power and the other dignities belonging to the principate.

Otho had owed his own success to the resentment felt by the Praetorian guards and the rest of the army at Galba's refusal to pay the promised gold to the ones who supported his accession to the throne. The population of the city was also unhappy with Galba and cherished the memory of Nero. Otho's first acts as Emperor showed that he was not unmindful of these facts.

== Decline and fall ==

He accepted, or appeared to accept, the [[cognomen]] of Nero conferred upon him by the shouts of the populace, whom his comparative youth and the effeminacy of his appearance reminded of their lost favourite. Nero's statues were again set up, his freedmen and household officers reinstalled (including the young castrated boy [[Sporus]] whom Nero had taken in marriage and Otho would also live intimately with&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ek_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA897 |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology |author=Smith, Willian |publisher=C.

At the same time the fears of the more sober and respectable citizens were allayed by Otho's liberal professions of his intention to govern equitably, and by his judicious clemency towards [[Marius Celsus]], consul-designate, a devoted adherent of Galba. Otho soon realized that it was much easier to overthrow an Emperor than rule as one: according to [[Suetonius]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Otho*.html  Chapter 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Otho once remarked that &quot;Playing the Long Pipes is hardly my trade&quot; (i.e. undertaking something beyond one's ability to do so).

=== War with Vitellius ===
[[File:Portrait of M. Silvius Otho, Roman Emperor by Robert Van Voerst after Tiziano Vecellio.jpg|thumb|left|Otho by [[Robert Van Voerst]] after [[Titian]].]]
Any further development of Otho's policy was checked once Otho had read through Galba's private correspondence and realized the extent of the revolution in [[Germany]], where several legions had declared for [[Vitellius]], the commander of the legions on the lower [[Rhine River]], and were already advancing upon [[Italy]]. After a vain attempt to conciliate Vitellius by the offer of a share in the Empire, Otho, with unexpected vigor, prepared for war. From the much more remote provinces, which had acquiesced in his accession, little help was to be expected; but the legions of [[Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]] and [[Moesia]] were eager in his cause, the Praetorian cohorts were in themselves a formidable force and an efficient [[Roman Navy|fleet]] gave him the mastery of the Italian seas.

The fleet was at once dispatched to secure [[Liguria]], and on 14 March Otho, undismayed by omens and prophecies, started northwards at the head of his troops in the hopes of preventing the entry of Vitellius' troops into Italy. But for this he was too late, and all that could be done was to throw troops into [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] and hold the line of the [[Po river|Po]]. Otho's advanced guard successfully defended Placentia against [[Aulus Caecina Alienus]], and compelled that general to fall back on [[Cremona]]. But the arrival of [[Fabius Valens]] altered the aspect of affairs.

Vitellius' commanders now resolved to bring on a decisive battle, the [[Battle of Bedriacum]], and their designs were assisted by the divided and irresolute counsels which prevailed in Otho's camp. The more experienced officers urged the importance of avoiding a battle, until at least the legions from [[Dalmatia]] had arrived. But the rashness of the Emperor's brother [[Titianus]] and of Proculus, prefect of the Praetorian Guards, added to Otho's feverish impatience, overruled all opposition, and an immediate advance was decided upon.

Otho himself remained behind with a considerable reserve force at [[Brixellum]], on the southern bank of the Po. When this decision was taken, Otho's army had already crossed the Po and were encamped at [[Bedriacum]] (or Betriacum), a small village on the ''Via Postumia'', and on the route by which the legions from Dalmatia would naturally arrive.
[[File:Aureus Othonis RIC15.png|thumb|[[Aureus]] of Otho.]]
Leaving a strong detachment to hold the camp at Bedriacum, the Othonian forces advanced along the ''Via Postumia'' in the direction of Cremona. At a short distance from that city they unexpectedly encountered the Vitellian troops. The Othonians, though taken at a disadvantage, fought desperately, but were finally forced to fall back in disorder upon their camp at Bedriacum. There on the next day the victorious Vitellians followed them, but only to come to terms at once with their disheartened enemy, and to be welcomed into the camp as friends.

=== Death ===
More unexpected still was the effect produced at Brixellum by the news of the battle. Otho was still in command of a formidable force: the Dalmatian legions had already reached [[Aquileia]] and the spirit of his soldiers and their officers was unbroken. But he was resolved to accept the verdict of the battle that his own impatience had hastened. In a dignified speech he bade farewell to those about him, declaring: &quot;It is far more just to perish one for all, than many for one&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/63*.html#64-13.2 Dio, LXIV.13&lt;/ref&gt; and then retiring to rest soundly for some hours. Early in the morning he stabbed himself in the heart with a dagger, which he had concealed under his pillow, and died as his attendants entered the tent.

Otho's ashes were placed within a modest monument. He had reigned only three months. His funeral was celebrated at once, as he had wished. A plain tomb was erected in his honour at Brixellum, with the simple inscription ''Diis Manibus Marci Othonis''.

==Reasons for suicide==
It has been thought that Otho's [[suicide]] was committed in order to steer his country from the path to civil war. Just as he had come to power, many Romans learned to respect Otho in his death. Few could believe that a renowned former companion of [[Nero]] had chosen such an honourable end. The soldiers were so moved and impressed that some even threw themselves on the funeral pyre to die with their Emperor.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Writing during the reign of the Emperor [[Domitian]] (AD 81–96), the Roman poet [[Martial]] expressed his admiration for Otho's choice to spare the Empire from civil war through sacrificing himself:

::::::::&quot;Although the goddess of civil warfare was still in doubt,
::::::::And soft Otho had perhaps still a chance of winning,
::::::::He renounced fighting that would have cost much blood,
::::::::And with sure hand pierced right through his breast.
::::::::By all means let [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] in his life be greater than [[Julius Caesar]] himself;
::::::::In his death was he greater than Otho?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martial, Epigrams VI.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
Suetonius, in ''The Lives of the Caesars'', comments on Otho's appearance and personal hygiene.

{{quote|He is said to have been of moderate height, splay-footed and bandy-legged, but almost feminine in his care of his person. He had the hair of his body plucked out, and because of the thinness of his locks wore a wig so carefully fashioned and fitted to his head, that no one suspected it. Moreover, they say that he used to shave every day and smear his face with moist bread, beginning the practice with the appearance of the first down, so as never to have a beard}}

Juvenal, in a passage in the [[Satire II]] dealing with homosexuality, specifically mentions Otho as being vain, looking at himself in the mirror prior to going into battle, and &quot;plaster[ing] his face with dough&quot; in order to look good.

{{Year of Four Emperors}}
'''Vitellius''' ({{lang-la|Aulus Vitellius Germanicus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]:
:{{sqc|AVLVS VITELLIVS GERMANICVS AVGVSTVS}}
:{{IPA-la|ˈau̯.lʊs wɪˈtɛl.li.ʊs gɛr'maː.nɪ.kʊs au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 September 15 – 22 December 69) was [[Roman Emperor]] for eight months, from 16 April to 22 December 69. Vitellius was proclaimed emperor following the quick succession of the previous emperors [[Galba]] and [[Otho]], in a year of civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].

Vitellius was the first to add the honorific [[cognomen]] ''Germanicus'' to his name instead of ''Caesar'' upon his accession; the latter name had fallen into disrepute in many quarters because of the actions of [[Nero]].

His claim to the throne was soon challenged by legions stationed in the eastern provinces, who proclaimed their commander [[Vespasian]] emperor instead. War ensued, leading to a crushing defeat for Vitellius at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum]] in northern [[Italy]]. Once he realised his support was wavering, Vitellius prepared to abdicate in favor of Vespasian but was executed in Rome by Vespasian's soldiers on 22 December 69.

==Family==
He was the son of [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder|Lucius Vitellius Veteris]] and his wife [[Sextilia]], and had one brother, [[Lucius Vitellius the Younger]]. [[Suetonius]] recorded two different accounts of the origins of the [[Vitellia (gens)]], one making them descendants of past rulers of [[Latium]], the other describing their origins as  lowly.&lt;ref name=Lives1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lives of the Twelve Caesars: The Life of Vitellius |last=[[Suetonius]] |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html}} Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Suetonius makes the sensible remark that both accounts might have been made by either flatterers or enemies of Vitellius—except that both were in circulation before Vitellius became emperor.&lt;ref name=Lives1/&gt; Suetonius also recorded that when Vitellius was born his horoscope so horrified his parents that his father tried to prevent Aulus from becoming a consul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lives of the Twelve Caesars: The Life of Vitellius |last=Suetonius |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html}} Chapter 3, part 2&lt;/ref&gt;

He married firstly before the year 40 a woman named Petronia, daughter of Publius Petronius or Gaius Petronius Pontius Nigrinus, by whom he had a son Aulus Vitellius Petronianus, the universal heir of his mother and grandfather, whom he{{who|date=December 2015}} had killed in 69 in order to inherit his fortune.

He married secondly, around the year 50, a woman named [[Galeria Fundana]], perhaps the granddaughter of [[Gaius Galerius]], Prefect of Egypt in 23. They had two children, a son called Aulus Vitellius Germanicus or Novis, the Younger, and a daughter, Vitellia, who married the Legatus [[Decimus Valerius Asiaticus (Legatus)|Decimus Valerius Asiaticus]].

==Public service==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}

===Political and military career===
He was [[Roman consul|Consul]] in 48, and assumed [[Proconsul]] of [[Africa (province)|Africa]] in either 60 or 61, in which capacity he is said to have acquitted himself with credit. At the end of 68, [[Galba]], to the general astonishment, selected him to command the army of [[Germania Inferior]], and here Vitellius made himself popular with his subalterns and with the soldiers by outrageous prodigality and excessive good nature, which soon proved fatal to order and discipline.

===Bid for power===
He owed his elevation to the throne to [[Aulus Caecina Alienus|Caecina]] and [[Fabius Valens]], commanders of two legions on the [[Rhine]]. Through these two men a military revolution was speedily accomplished; they refused to renew their vows of allegiance to Emperor [[Galba]] on 1 January 69, and early in 69 Vitellius was proclaimed emperor at [[Cologne]]. More accurately, he was proclaimed Emperor of the armies of Germania Inferior and [[Germania Superior|Superior]]. The armies of Gaul, Brittania and Raetia sided with them shortly afterwards. By the time that they marched on Rome, however, it was [[Otho]], and not Galba, whom they had to confront.

In fact, he was never acknowledged as Emperor by the entire Roman world, though at Rome the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] accepted him and decreed to him the usual Imperial honours. He advanced into Italy at the head of a licentious and rough soldiery, and Rome became the scene of riot and massacre, gladiatorial shows and extravagant feasting. To reward his victorious legionaries, Vitellius disbanded the existing Praetorian Guard and installed his own men instead.

==Emperor==

===Administration===
[[Image:Vittelius monnaie ag1.JPG|thumb|250px|Vitellius on a [[coin]].]]
[[Suetonius]], whose father had fought for [[Otho]] at [[Battle of Bedriacum|Bedriacum]], gives an unfavourable account of Vitellius' brief administration: he describes him as unambitious and notes that Vitellius showed indications of a desire to govern wisely, but that Valens and Caecina encouraged him in a course of vicious excesses which threw his better qualities into the background. Vitellius is described as lazy and self-indulgent, fond of eating and drinking, and an obese glutton, eating banquets four times a day and feasting on rare foods he would send the Roman navy to procure.

For these banquets, he had himself invited over to a different noble's house for each one. He is even reported to have starved his own mother to death—to fulfill a prophecy that he would rule longer if his mother died first; alternatively there is a report that his mother asked for poison to commit suicide-a request he granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html Suetonius &quot;Vitellius&quot; Chapter 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, namely [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]], disagree with some of Suetonius' assertions, even though their own accounts of Vitellius are scarcely positive ones.

Despite his short reign he made two important contributions to Roman government which outlasted him. [[Tacitus]] describes them both in his [[Histories (Tacitus)|''Histories'']]:
*Vitellius ended the practice of Centurions selling furloughs and exemptions of duty to their men, a change Tacitus describes as being adopted by 'all good emperors'.
*He also expanded the offices of the Imperial Administration beyond the imperial pool of Freedmen allowing those of the [[Equites]] to take up positions in the Imperial Civil Service.

Vitellius also banned astrologers from Rome and Italy on 1 October, 69. Some astrologers responded to his decree by anonymously publishing a decree of their own: &quot;Decreed by all astrologers in blessing on our State Vitellius will be no more on the appointed date.&quot; In response, Vitellius executed any astrologers he came across.&lt;ref&gt;Tamsyn Barton, ''Ancient Astrology'', p. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===
In July 69, Vitellius learned that the armies of the eastern provinces had proclaimed a rival emperor; their commander, [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]. As soon as it was known that the armies of the East, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] had declared for Vespasianus, Vitellius, deserted by many of his adherents, would have resigned the title of emperor.

===Resignation and death===
Tacitus' ''Histories'' state that Vitellius awaited Vespasian's army at [[Mevania]]. The terms of resignation had actually been agreed upon with [[Marcus Antonius Primus]], the commander of the sixth legion serving in [[Pannonia]] and one of Vespasian’s chief supporters, but the praetorians refused to allow him to carry out the agreement, and forced him to return to the palace, when he was on his way to deposit the insignia of empire in the Temple of Concord.

On the entrance of Vespasian's troops into Rome he was dragged out of a hiding-place (according to [[Tacitus]] a door-keeper's lodge), driven to the fatal [[Gemonian stairs]], and there struck down. &quot;Yet I was once your emperor,&quot; were his last words. His body was thrown into the Tiber according to [[Suetonius]]; [[Cassius Dio]]'s account is that Vitellius was beheaded and his head paraded around Rome, and his wife attended to his burial. His brother and son were also killed.

Suetonius in writing of Vitellius execution describes his physical description: &quot;..He was in fact abnormally tall, with a face usually flushed from hard drinking, a huge belly, and one thigh crippled from being struck once time by a four-horse chariot, when he was in attendance on [[Caligula|Gaius]] as he was driving...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html Suetonius &quot;Vitellius&quot; Chapter 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

Years before there was a prediction that he would fall into the power of a man from [[Gaul]]; the man who slayed him was Antonius Primus of Tolosa and whose surname was Becco which means &quot;Roosters beak&quot; {Gallus means both &quot;a cock&quot; and &quot;a Gaul&quot;}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vitellius*.html Suetonius &quot;Vitellius&quot; Chapter 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals in Art==
Vitellius is also shown in the painting ''Decadence of the Romans'' by [[Thomas Couture]].
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|250px|''Decadence of the Romans''.]]

==Fictional portrayals==
*Vitellius is a character in Kate Quinn's novel ''Daughters of Rome'' (2011), set in AD 68–79.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Daughters of Rome|date=2011|publisher=  [[Headline Review]]|author=Quinn, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*He is also a prominent character in [[Simon Scarrow]]'s [[Eagle series]], where he is introduced as a rival to Vespasian and an adversary to the main characters, Macro and Cato, during the invasion of Britain.
*Vitellius is a character in M.C. Scott's novel ''Rome, The Art of War'' (2013). Although emperor in the novel, his brother Lucius is portrayed as being the more powerful and skilled in intrigue and ruthlessness.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
*He is also introduced in chapter XX of Henry Venmore-Rowland's novel ''The Last Caesar'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Venmore-Rowland, Henry|title=The Last Caesar|publisher= Bantam Press (an imprint of Transworld Publishers) |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the newly appointed Governor of Lower Germania at the beginning of AD 69.
* [[Lindsey Davis]]' historically accurate [[crime novel]] set in [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[The Silver Pigs]]'',  notes a recipe for mushy [[pea]]s  was named after him. (Chapter XX, p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitellian Peas|website=Big Oven|url=http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/pisam-vitellianam-vitellian-peas/311011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vespasian''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɛ|s|ˈ|p|eɪ|ʒ|i|ən|,_|v|ɛ|s|ˈ|p|eɪ|z|i|ən}};&amp;nbsp; {{lang-la|Titus Flāvius Caesar Vespasiānus Augustus}};&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]:
:{{sqc|TITVS FLAVIVS CAESAR VESPASIANVS AVGVSTVS}}
:{{IPA-la|ˈtɪ.tʊs ˈflaː.wi.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar wɛs.pa.siˈaː.nʊs au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 17 November 9 – 23 June 79&lt;ref&gt;Levick, ''Vespasian'', xxi &amp; 4&lt;/ref&gt;) was [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 69 to AD 79. Vespasian founded the [[Flavian dynasty]] that ruled the Empire for twenty seven years. Vespasian was from an [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family that rose into the [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank under the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio–Claudian]] emperors. Although he fulfilled the [[cursus honorum|standard succession]] of public offices, and held the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in AD 51, Vespasian's renown came from his military success: he was [[legatus|legate]] of [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']] during the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43&lt;ref&gt;Levick, ''Vespasian'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and subjugated [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] during the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish rebellion]] of 66.&lt;ref&gt;Levick, ''Vespasian'', 29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Vespasian [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 AD)|besieged]] [[Jerusalem]] during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish rebellion]], emperor [[Nero]] committed suicide and plunged Rome into a year of [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. After [[Galba]] and [[Otho]] perished in quick succession, [[Vitellius]] became the third emperor in April 69. The Roman legions of [[Roman Egypt]] and Judaea reacted by declaring Vespasian, their commander, emperor on 1 July 69.&lt;ref&gt;Levick, ''Vespasian, '' 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus|Mucianus]], the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], and [[Marcus Antonius Primus|Primus]], a general in [[Pannonia]], leaving his son [[Titus]] to command the besieging forces at [[Jerusalem]]. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian took control of Egypt. On 20 December 69, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared Emperor by the [[Roman Senate]]. Vespasian dated his tribunician years from 1 July, substituting the acts of Rome's senate and people as the legal basis for his appointment with the declaration of his legions, and transforming his legions into an [[electoral college]].&lt;ref&gt;ODCW, ''Vespasian'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Little information survives about the government during Vespasian's ten-year rule. He reformed the financial system at Rome after the campaign against Judaea ended successfully, and initiated several ambitious construction projects. He built the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known today as the Roman [[Colosseum]]. In reaction to the events of 68–69, Vespasian forced through an improvement in army discipline. Through his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], Vespasian increased imperial expansion in Britain. After his death in 79, he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Titus]], thus becoming the first Roman Emperor to be directly succeeded by his own natural son&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;[[Julius Caesar]] was succeeded by his adopted son [[Augustus]], but Caesar was not styled an emperor, nor was he Augustus's biological father.&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing the Flavian dynasty.

== Family ==

Vespasian was born in a village north-east of Rome called [[Falacrinae]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt; His family was relatively undistinguished and lacking in pedigree. His paternal grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, became the first to distinguish himself, rising to the rank of [[centurion]] and fighting at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] for [[Pompey]] in 48 BC. Subsequently he became a debt collector.&lt;ref name=gm&gt;Morgan (2006), 170–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Petro's son, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], worked as a [[customs (tax)|customs]] official in the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and became a money-lender on a small scale among the [[Helvetii]]. He gained a reputation as a scrupulous and honest &quot;tax-farmer&quot;. Sabinus married up in status, to [[Vespasia Polla]], whose father had risen to the rank of [[Praefectus Castrorum|prefect of the camp]] and whose brother became a [[Roman Senate|Senator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gm&quot;/&gt;

Sabinus and Vespasia had three children, the eldest of whom, a girl, died in infancy. The elder boy, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]] entered public life and pursued the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. He served in the army as a military [[tribune]] in [[Thracia|Thrace]] in 36. The following year he was elected [[quaestor]] and served in [[Crete]] and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. He rose through the ranks of Roman public office, being elected [[aedile]] on his second attempt in 39 and [[praetor]] on his first attempt in 40, taking the opportunity to ingratiate himself with the Emperor [[Caligula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gm&quot;/&gt;

The younger boy, Vespasian, seemed far less likely to be successful, initially not wishing to pursue high public office. He followed in his brother's footsteps when driven to it by his mother's taunting.&lt;ref name=gm/&gt; During this period he married [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla]], the daughter of Flavius Liberalis from [[Ferentium]] and formerly the mistress of [[Statilius Capella]], a Roman equestrian from Sabrata in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 3&lt;/ref&gt;

They had two sons, [[Titus|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]] (born 41) and [[Domitian|Titus Flavius Domitianus]] (born 51), and a daughter, [[Domitilla the Younger|Domitilla]] (born 39). His wife Domitilla and his daughter Domitilla both died before Vespasian became Emperor in 69. After the death of his wife, Vespasian's longstanding mistress, Antonia [[Caenis]], became his wife in all but formal status, a relationship that survived until she died in 75.&lt;ref name=gm/&gt;

== Military and political career ==
{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}

=== Early career ===

In preparation for a [[praetor]]ship, Vespasian needed two periods of service in the minor [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Empire|magistracies]], one military and the other public. Vespasian served in the military in Thrace for about 3 years. On his return to Rome in about AD 30, he obtained a post in the [[Vigintisexviri|''vigintivirate'']], the minor magistracies, most probably in one of the posts in charge of street cleaning.&lt;ref name=levick&gt;Levick, ''Vespasian''.&lt;/ref&gt; His early performance was so unsuccessful that Emperor Caligula reportedly stuffed handfuls of muck down his toga to correct the uncleaned Roman streets, formally his responsibility.&lt;ref name=gm/&gt;

During the period of the ascendancy of [[Sejanus]], there is no record of Vespasian's significant activity in political events. After completion of a term in the vigintivirate, Vespasian was entitled to stand for election as quaestor; a senatorial office. But his lack of political or family influence meant that Vespasian served as quaestor in one of the provincial posts in [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Crete]], rather than as assistant to important men in Rome.&lt;ref name=levick/&gt;

Next he needed to gain a praetorship, carrying the ''[[Imperium]]'', but non-[[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and the less well-connected had to serve in at least one intermediary post as an ''[[aedile]]'' or [[tribune]]. Vespasian failed at his first attempt to gain an aedileship but was successful in his second attempt, becoming an aedile in 38. Despite his lack of significant family connections or success in office, he achieved praetorship in either 39 or 40, at the youngest age permitted (30), during a period of political upheaval in the organisation of elections. His longstanding relationship with freedwoman [[Antonia Caenis]], confidential secretary to the Emperor's grandmother and part of the circle of [[courtier]]s and servants around the Emperor, may have contributed to his success.&lt;ref name=levick/&gt;

=== Invasion of Britannia (43) ===

Upon the accession of [[Claudius]] as emperor in 41, Vespasian was appointed [[legatus|legate]] of [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], stationed in [[Germania]], thanks to the influence of the Imperial [[freedman]] [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]]. In 43, Vespasian and the II ''Augusta'' participated in the [[Roman invasion of Britain]], and he distinguished himself under the overall command of [[Aulus Plautius]]. After participating in crucial early battles on the rivers [[River Medway|Medway]] and [[River Thames|Thames]], he was sent to reduce the south west, penetrating through the modern counties of [[Hampshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Dorset]], [[Somerset]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] with the probable objectives of securing the south coast ports and harbours along with the tin mines of Cornwall and the silver and lead mines of Somerset.

Vespasian marched from [[Noviomagus Reginorum]] ([[Chichester]]) to subdue the hostile [[Durotriges]] and [[Dumnonii]] tribes,&lt;ref&gt;A History of Britain, Richard Dargie (2007), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; captured twenty ''oppida'' (towns, or more probably [[hill fort]]s, including [[Hod Hill]] and [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] in [[Dorset]]). He also invaded Vectis (now the [[Isle of Wight]]), finally setting up a fortress and legionary headquarters at [[Isca Dumnoniorum]] ([[Exeter]]). During this time he injured himself and had not fully recovered until he went to Egypt. These successes earned him triumphal regalia (''ornamenta triumphalia'') on his return to Rome.

=== Later political career (51–66) ===
[[File:The Emperor sends Vespasian with an army to destroy the Jews (f. 177v) Cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|The Roman Emperor [[Nero]] sends '''Vespasian''' with an army to destroy the Jews, 69 A.D.]]

His success as the legate of a legion earned him a consulship in 51, after which he retired from public life, having incurred the enmity of [[Emperor Claudius|Claudius]]' wife, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]].&lt;ref name=gm/&gt; He came out of retirement in 63 when he was sent as governor to [[Africa Province]]. According to [[Tacitus]] (ii.97), his rule was &quot;infamous and odious&quot; but according to [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] (''Vesp. '' 4), he was &quot;upright and, highly honourable&quot;. On one occasion, Suetonius writes, Vespasian was pelted with [[turnip]]s.

Vespasian used his time in North Africa wisely. Usually governorships were seen by ex-consuls as opportunities to extort huge amounts of money to regain the wealth they had spent on their previous political campaigns. Corruption was so rife that it was almost expected that a governor would come back from these appointments with his pockets full. However, Vespasian used his time in North Africa making friends instead of money, something that would be far more valuable in the years to come. During his time in North Africa, he found himself in financial difficulties and was forced to mortgage his estates to his brother. To revive his fortunes he turned to the [[mule]] trade and gained the nickname ''mulio'' (muleteer).&lt;ref name=&quot;Suetonius, Vesp. 4–5&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from Africa, Vespasian toured Greece in [[Nero]]'s retinue, but lost Imperial favour after paying insufficient attention (some sources suggest he fell asleep) during one of the Emperor's recitals on the [[lyre]], and found himself in the political wilderness.

=== Great Jewish Revolt (66–69) ===
{{main|First Jewish–Roman War}}
[[Image:Sestertius - Vespasiano - Iudaea Capta-RIC 0424.jpg|thumb|300px|Vespasian [[sestertius]], struck in 71 to celebrate the victory in the first Jewish-Roman war. The legend on the reverse says: [[Judaea Capta coinage|IVDEA CAPTA]], &quot;[[Iudaea (Roman province)|Judaea]] conquered&quot;.]]

In 66 AD, Vespasian was appointed to suppress the Jewish revolt underway in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. The fighting there had killed the previous governor and routed [[Cestius Gallus]], the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], when he tried to restore order. Two legions, with eight cavalry squadrons and ten [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cohorts, were therefore dispatched under the command of Vespasian while his elder son, Titus, arrived from [[Alexandria]] with another.

During this time he became the patron of [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] resistance leader captured at the [[Siege of Yodfat]], who would later write his people's history in Greek. Ultimately, thousands of Jews were killed and the Romans destroyed many towns in re-establishing control over Judea; they also took Jerusalem in 70. Vespasian is remembered by Josephus, in his ''Antiquities of the Jews'', as a fair and humane official, in contrast with the notorious [[Herod Agrippa II]] whom Josephus goes to great lengths to demonize.

While under the emperor's patronage, Josephus wrote that after the Roman [[Legio X Fretensis]], accompanied by Vespasian, destroyed [[Jericho]] on 21 June 68, Vespasian took a group of Jews who could not swim (possibly [[Essenes]] from [[Qumran]]), fettered them, and threw them into the [[Dead Sea]] to test the sea's legendary [[buoyancy]]. Indeed, the victims bobbed up to the surface after being thrown in the water from the boats.

Josephus (as well as [[Tacitus]]), reporting on the conclusion of the Jewish war, claimed that around the time when Jerusalem and the Temple would be taken, a man from their own nation, ''viz.'' the Messiah, would become governor of the habitable earth. Josephus, dismissing these things, said that the only governor of the habitable earth was Vespasian who conquered it.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' 6.5.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' 5.13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Year of the Four Emperors (69) ==
{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Year of the Four Emperors}}
{{Year of Four Emperors}}

After the death of Nero in 68, Rome saw a succession of short-lived emperors and a year of [[civil war]]s. [[Galba]] was murdered by supporters of [[Otho]], who was defeated by [[Vitellius]]. Otho's supporters, looking for another candidate to support, settled on Vespasian.

According to Suetonius, a prophecy ubiquitous in the Eastern provinces claimed that from Judaea would come the future rulers of the world. Vespasian eventually believed that this prophecy applied to him, and found a number of [[omen]]s, [[oracle]]s, and [[Portent (divination)|portents]] that reinforced this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html LXV.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|550px|A map of the Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69). Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus]]. {{Dubious|Incorrect map|date=December 2011|reason=Incorrect, see discussion on [[:commons:File talk:Roman Empire 69.svg#Dacia? Moesia?|image talk page]]}}]]
He also found encouragement in Mucianus, the governor of Syria; and, although Vespasian was a strict disciplinarian and reformer of abuses, Vespasian's soldiers were thoroughly devoted to him. All eyes in the East were now upon him. Mucianus and the Syrian legions were eager to support him. While he was at [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], he was proclaimed emperor (1 July 69), first by the army in [[Egypt]] under [[Tiberius Julius Alexander]], and then by his troops in Judaea (11 July according to Suetonius, 3 July according to Tacitus).

Nevertheless, [[Vitellius]], the occupant of the throne, had Rome's best troops on his side — the veteran legions of [[Gaul]] and the [[Rhineland]]. But the feeling in Vespasian's favour quickly gathered strength, and the armies of [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] soon declared for him, and made him the ''de facto'' master of half of the Roman world.

While Vespasian himself was in Egypt securing its [[Rome's grain supply|grain supply]], his troops entered Italy from the northeast under the leadership of [[Marcus Antonius Primus|M. Antonius Primus]]. They defeated Vitellius's army (which had awaited him in [[Mevania]]) at [[Battle of Bedriacum|Bedriacum]] (or Betriacum), sacked [[Cremona]] and advanced on Rome. Vitellius hastily arranged a peace with Antonius, but the Emperor's [[Praetorian Guard]] forced him to retain his seat. After furious fighting, Antonius' army entered Rome. In the resulting confusion, the Capitol was destroyed by fire and Vespasian's brother Sabinus was killed by a mob.

On receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at [[Alexandria]], the new emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to [[treason]]. While in Egypt he visited the Temple of [[Serapis]], where reportedly he experienced a [[vision (religion)|vision]]. Later he was confronted by two labourers who were convinced that he possessed a divine power that could work [[miracle]]s.

== Emperor (69–79) ==

=== Aftermath of the civil war ===

[[Image:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of Vespasian, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow.]]
Vespasian was declared emperor by the Senate while he was in Egypt in December of 69 (the Egyptians had declared him emperor in June 69). In the short-term, administration of the empire was given to [[Mucianus]] who was aided by Vespasian's son, [[Domitian]]. Mucianus started off Vespasian's rule with tax reform that was to restore the empire's finances. After Vespasian arrived in Rome in mid-70, Mucianus continued to press Vespasian to collect as many taxes as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVI.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespasian and Mucianus renewed old taxes and instituted new ones, increased the tribute of the provinces, and kept a watchful eye upon the treasury officials. The Latin [[proverb]] &quot;[[Pecunia non olet]]&quot; (&quot;Money does not smell&quot;) may have been created when he had introduced a [[urine tax]] on public toilets.

In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt, the source of Rome's grain supply, and had not yet left for Rome. According to [[Tacitus]], his trip was delayed due to bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' IV&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians theorize that Vespasian had been and was continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Phillip, &quot;A Note on Flavian Accession&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'', 1953, p. 67-70&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of a divine Vespasian healing people circulated in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXVI.2&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, protests erupted in Alexandria over his new tax policies and grain shipments were held up. Vespasian eventually restored order and grain shipments to Rome resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the uprising in Egypt, unrest and civil war continued in the rest of the empire in 70. In Judea, rebellion had continued from 66. Vespasian's son, [[Titus]], finally subdued the rebellion with the capture of Jerusalem and destruction of the [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]] in 70. According to [[Eusebius]], Vespasian then ordered all descendants of the royal line of [[David]] to be hunted down, causing the Jews to be persecuted from province to province. Several modern historians have suggested that Vespasian, already having been told by Josephus that he was prophesied to become emperor whilst in Judaea, was probably reacting to other widely known Messianic prophecies circulating at the time, to suppress any rival claimants arising from that dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Paul Barnett, ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity'' p. 31; 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;JEWS&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January of the same year, an uprising occurred in [[Gaul]] and Germany, known as the second [[Batavian Rebellion]]. This rebellion was headed by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] and [[Julius Sabinus]]. Sabinus, claiming he was descended from [[Julius Caesar]], declared himself Emperor of Gaul. The rebellion defeated and absorbed two Roman legions before it was suppressed by Vespasian's brother-in-law, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], by the end of 70.

=== Arrival in Rome and gathering support ===

In mid-70, Vespasian first came to Rome. Vespasian immediately embarked on a series of efforts to stay in power and prevent future revolts. He offered gifts to many in the military and much of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History' LXVI.10&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers loyal to Vitellius were dismissed or punished.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 8&lt;/ref&gt; He also restructured the Senatorial and Equestrian orders, removing his enemies and adding his allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Vespasian 9&lt;/ref&gt; Regional autonomy of Greek provinces was repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 8; Philostratus II, ''Life of Apollonius'' 5.41&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he made significant attempts to control public perception of his rule.

=== Propaganda campaign ===

[[Image:Vespasian aureus Fortuna.png|thumb|330px|Roman [[aureus]] depicting Vespasian as Emperor. The reverse shows the goddess [[Fortuna]].]]
Many modern historians note the increased amount of propaganda that appeared during Vespasian's reign.&lt;ref&gt;M. P. Charleswroth, &quot;Flaviana&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 27 (1938) 54–62&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of a supernatural emperor who was destined to rule circulated in the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suetonius, Vesp. 4–5&quot;/&gt; Nearly one-third of all coins minted in Rome under Vespasian celebrated military victory or peace.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, William &quot;Some Thoughts on the Propaganda of Vespasian and Domitian&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vindex'' was removed from coins so as not to remind the public of rebellious [[Vindex]]. Construction projects bore inscriptions praising Vespasian and condemning previous emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Aqueduct and roads dedication speak of previous emperors' neglect, ''CIL'' vi, 1257(''ILS'' 218) and 931&lt;/ref&gt; A temple of peace
was constructed in the forum as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Vespasian approved histories written under his reign, ensuring biases against him were removed.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Against Apion'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespasian also gave financial rewards to writers.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 18&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient historians who lived through the period such as [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Josephus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] speak suspiciously well of Vespasian while condemning the emperors who came before him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Otho, Vitellius, and the Propaganda of Vespasian&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'' (1965), p. 267-269&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus admits that his status was elevated by Vespasian, Josephus identifies Vespasian as a patron and savior, and Pliny dedicated his ''Natural Histories'' to Vespasian's son, Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' I.1; Josephus, ''The Life of Flavius Josephus'' 72; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who spoke against Vespasian were punished. A number of stoic philosophers were accused of corrupting students with inappropriate teachings and were expelled from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXVI.12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helvidius Priscus]], a pro-republic philosopher, was executed for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXVI.13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and conspiracies ===

Between 71 and 79, much of Vespasian's reign is a mystery. Historians report that Vespasian ordered the construction of several buildings in Rome. Additionally, he survived several conspiracies against him.

Vespasian helped rebuild Rome after the civil war. He added the temple of Peace and the temple to the Deified Claudius.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; In 75, he erected a colossal statue of [[Apollo]], begun under [[Nero]], and he dedicated a stage of the theater of Marcellus. He also began construction of the [[Colosseum]], using funds from the spoils of the [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ALFÖLDY|first=GÉZA|title=Eine Bauinschrift Aus Dem Colosseum.|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=1995|volume=109|pages=195–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]] claims that Vespasian was met with &quot;constant conspiracies&quot; against him.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 25&lt;/ref&gt; Only one conspiracy is known specifically, though. In 78 or 79, Eprius Marcellus and [[Aulus Caecina Alienus]] attempted to kill Vespasian. Why these men turned against Vespasian is not known.

=== Roman expansion in Britain (78–79) ===

In 78, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] was sent to [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and both extended and consolidated the Roman dominion in that province, pushing his way into what is now Scotland.

=== Death (79) ===

In his ninth consulship Vespasian had a slight illness in Campania and, returning at once to Rome, he left for [[Aquae Cutiliae]] and the country around [[Reate]], where he spent every summer; however, his illness worsened and he developed severe [[diarrhea]].

According to [[Suetonius]]' [[The Twelve Caesars]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At last, being taken ill of a diarrhea, to such a degree that he was ready to faint, he cried out, &quot;Dear me, I think I'm becoming a God. An emperor ought to die standing upright.&quot; In endeavouring to rise, he died in the hands of those who were helping him up, upon the eighth of the calends of July [24 June], being sixty-nine years, one month, and seven days old.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=I believe this is a direct quotation from Robert Graves' translation}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was succeeded by his son [[Titus]].

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|Construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the [[Colosseum]], was begun by Vespasian and finished by his son Titus.]]
Vespasian was known for his wit and his amiable manner alongside his commanding personality and military prowess. He could be liberal to impoverished Senators and equestrians and to cities and towns desolated by natural calamity. He was especially generous to men of letters and [[rhetor]]s, several of whom he pensioned with salaries of as much as 1,000 gold pieces a year. [[Quintilian]] is said to have been the first public teacher who enjoyed this imperial favor. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s work, the ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'', was written during Vespasian's reign, and dedicated to Vespasian's son Titus.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

Vespasian distrusted philosophers in general, viewing them as unmanly complainers who talked too much. It was the idle talk of philosophers, who liked to glorify ''the good times'' of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], that provoked Vespasian into reviving the obsolete penal laws against this profession as a precautionary measure. Only one, [[Helvidius Priscus]], was put to death after he had repeatedly affronted the Emperor by studied insults which Vespasian had initially tried to ignore. On discovering Priscus's public slander, his words were: &quot;I will not kill a dog that barks at me.&quot;{{fact|date=October 2015}}

Vespasian was indeed noted for mildness when dealing with political opposition. According to Suetonius, he bore the frank language of his friends, the quips of pleaders, and the impudence of the philosophers with the greatest patience. Although Licinius Mucianus, a man of questionable reputation as being the [[bottom (sex)|receiver in homosexual sex]], treated the Emperor with scant respect, Vespasian never criticised him publicly but privately uttered the words: &quot;I, at least, am a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vesp.'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; He was also noted for his benefactions to the people. Much money was spent on public works and the restoration and beautification of Rome: a new forum, the Temple of Peace, the public baths and the great show piece, the [[Colosseum]].{{fact|date=October 2015}}

Vespasian debased the [[denarius]] during his reign, reducing the silver purity from 93.5% to 90% — the silver weight dropping from 2.97&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.87&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;. Received from http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Romance languages]], urinals are still named after him (for example, ''vespasiano'' in Italian, and ''vespasienne'' in French&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[E. E. Cummings]]' autobiographical novel [[The Enormous Room]].&lt;/ref&gt;) probably in reference to a tax he placed on urine collection (useful due to its ammoniac content; see [[Pay toilet]]). Vespasian appears as the king of Paltisca in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' [[Gesta Danorum]], 2.1.7.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

'''Titus''' ({{lang-la|Titus Flāvius Caesar Vespasiānus Augustus}};{{efn|1=Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]:
:{{sqc|TITVS FLAVIVS CAESAR VESPASIANVS AVGVSTVS}}
:{{IPA-la|ˈtɪ.tʊs ˈflaː.wi.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar wɛs.pa.siˈaː.nʊs au̯ˈgʊs.tʊs|IPA}}}} 30 December 39 AD – 13 September 81 AD) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 79 to 81. A member of the [[Flavian dynasty]], Titus succeeded his father [[Vespasian]] upon his death, thus becoming the first Roman Emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father.

Prior to becoming Emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander, serving under his father in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor [[Nero]] in 68, launching Vespasian's bid for the imperial power during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|besieged and captured Jerusalem]], and destroyed the city and the [[Second Temple]]. For this achievement Titus was awarded a [[Roman Triumph|triumph]]: the [[Arch of Titus]] commemorates his victory to this day.

Under the rule of his father, Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as [[praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen [[Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I)|Berenice]]. Despite concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79, and was considered a good emperor by [[Suetonius]] and other contemporary historians.

As emperor, he is best known for completing the [[Colosseum]] and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]] and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the [[Roman Senate]] and succeeded by his younger brother [[Domitian]].

==Early life==
Titus was born in [[Rome]], probably on 30 December 39 AD, as the eldest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]—commonly known as Vespasian—and [[Domitilla the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius claims Titus was born in the year Caligula was assassinated, 41. However, this contradicts his statement that Titus died in his 42nd year, as well as Cassius Dio, who notes that Titus was 39 at the time of his accession. See [[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#1 1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#11 11]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#18 LXVI.18]; and {{Cite book|author=Brian Jones |author2=Robert Milns  |title=Suetonius: The Flavian Emperors: A Historical Commentary |year=2002 |publisher=Bristol Classical Press |location=London |isbn=1-85399-613-0 |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one younger sister, [[Domitilla the Younger]] (born 45), and one younger brother, also named [[Domitian|Titus Flavius Domitianus]] (born 51), but commonly referred to as Domitian.

=== Family background ===
Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new provincial nobility during the early part of the 1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-3&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; One such family was the ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', which rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the Emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Titus's great-grandfather, [[Titus Flavius Petro]], had served as a [[centurion]] under [[Pompey]] during [[Caesar's civil war]]. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-1&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus I]], Titus's grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-2&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status through his services as [[tax collector]] in Asia and banker in [[Helvetia]]. By marrying [[Vespasia Polla]] he allied himself to the more prestigious [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patrician]] ''gens Vespasia'', ensuring the elevation of his sons [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus II]] and [[Vespasian]] to the [[Roman senator|senatorial]] rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-2&quot;/&gt;

The [[cursus honorum|political career]] of Vespasian included the offices of [[quaestor]], [[aedile]] and [[praetor]], and culminated with a [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, (1992), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; What little is known of Titus's early life has been handed down to us by [[Suetonius]], who records that he was brought up at the imperial court in the company of [[Britannicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-2&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#1 2]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of emperor [[Claudius]], who would be murdered by [[Nero]] in 55.

The story was even told that Titus was reclining next to Britannicus, the night he was murdered, and sipped of the poison that was handed to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-2&quot;/&gt; Further details on his education are scarce, but it seems he showed early promise in the [[military science|military arts]] and was a skilled poet and orator both in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#3 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==
From c. 57 to 59 he was a military [[tribune]] in [[Germania]]. He also served in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], perhaps arriving c. 60 with reinforcements needed after the revolt of [[Boudica]]. In c. 63 he returned to Rome and married Arrecina Tertulla, daughter of a former [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]]. She died c. 65.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#4 4], with Jones and Milns, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus then took a new wife of a much more distinguished family, [[Marcia Furnilla]]. However, Marcia's family was closely linked to the opposition to [[Nero]]. Her uncle [[Barea Soranus]] and his daughter [[Servilia (1st century)|Servilia]] were among those who perished after the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 16#30|XVI.30–33]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians theorize that Titus divorced his wife because of her family's connection to the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Townend, &quot;Some Flavian Connections&quot;, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' (1961), p 57. See [[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#4 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus never remarried. Titus appears to have had multiple daughters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_7_06.html#%A77 VII.7]&lt;/ref&gt; at least one of them by Marcia Furnilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-4&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#4 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The only one known to have survived to adulthood was [[Julia Flavia]], perhaps Titus's child by Arrecina, whose mother was also named Julia.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Milns, pp. 96, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of [[quaestor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-4&quot;/&gt;

===Judaean campaigns===
{{Further|First Jewish-Roman War}}
[[Image:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|250px|The [[Iudaea Province|province of Judaea]] during the 1st century.]]
In 66 the Jews of the J[[Iudaea Province|udaea Province]] [[First Jewish-Roman War|revolted against the Roman Empire]]. [[Cestius Gallus]], the [[History of Syria#Syria in antiquity|legate of Syria]], was defeated at [[Battle of Beth Horon (66)|the battle of]] [[Beth-Horon]] and forced to retreat from [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book II#Chapter 19|II.19.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Roman king [[Agrippa II]] and his sister [[Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I)|Berenice]] fled the city to [[Galilee]] where they later gave themselves up to the Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 1|III.1.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Legion]] and [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He was later joined at [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]] by Titus with the [[Legio XV Apollinaris|Fifteenth Legion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-iii-4-2&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''The War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 4|III.4.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans prepared to sweep across Galilee and march on Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-iii-4-2&quot;/&gt;

The history of the war was covered in detail by the Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] in his work ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. Josephus served as a commander in the city of [[Jotapata|Yodfat]] when the Roman army invaded Galilee in 67. After an exhausting siege which lasted 47 days, the city fell, with an estimated 40,000 killed and the remaining Jews committing suicide (except Josephus).&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 7|III.7.34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving a group suicide, Josephus surrendered to Vespasian and became a prisoner.  He later wrote that he provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 8|III.8.8]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 68, the entire coast and the north of Judaea were subjugated by the Roman army, with decisive victories won at [[Magdala|Taricheae]] and [[Gamla|Gamala]], where Titus distinguished himself as a skilled general.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book III#Chapter 10|III.10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Year of the Four Emperors====
[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (AD 69). Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus]].]]
The last and most significant fortified city held by the [[Zealotry|Jewish resistance]] was Jerusalem. The campaign came to a sudden halt when news arrived of Nero's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-iv-9-2&quot;&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book IV#Chapter 9|IV.9.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost simultaneously, the [[Roman Senate]] had declared [[Galba]], then governor of [[Hispania]], as Emperor of Rome. Vespasian decided to await further orders, and sent Titus to greet the new ''[[princeps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#1|II.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by [[Otho]], governor of [[Lusitania]], and that [[Vitellius]] and his armies in [[Germania]] were preparing to march on the capital, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, he abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-ii-2&quot;&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#2|II.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Otho was defeated in the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]] and committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#41|II.41–49]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the news reached the armies in Judaea and [[Ægyptus]], they took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book IV#Chapter 10|IV.10.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Vespasian accepted, and through negotiations by Titus, joined forces with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], governor of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#5|II.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge to end the Jewish rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book IV#Chapter 11|IV.11.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#82|II.82]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 69, the forces of Vitellius had been beaten, and Vespasian was officially declared emperor by the Senate on 21 December, thus ending the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#3|IV.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siege of Jerusalem====
{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)}}
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 017.jpg|thumb|250px|''Destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem'', [[Francesco Hayez]], oil on canvas, 1867. Depicting the destruction and looting of the Second Temple by the Roman army.]]
Meanwhile, the Jews had become embroiled in a civil war of their own, splitting the resistance in Jerusalem between several factions. The [[Sicarii]] led by [[Menahem ben Judah]] cannot hold on for long; the [[Zealots]] led by [[Eleazar ben Simon]] eventually fall under the command of the Galilean leader [[John of Gischala|John of Gush Halav]]; and the other northern rebel commander, [[Simon Bar Giora]], manages to gain leadership over the [[Edom|Idumeans]] too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book V#Chapter 1|V.1.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|besieged Jerusalem]]. The Roman army was joined by the [[Legio XII Fulminata|Twelfth Legion]], which was previously defeated under [[Cestius Gallus]], and from Alexandria Vespasian sent [[Tiberius Julius Alexander]], governor of Egypt, to act as Titus' second in command.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book V#Chapter 1|V.1.6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus surrounded the city, with three legions (Vth, XIIth and XVth) on the western side and one (Xth) on the [[Mount of Olives]] to the east. He put pressure on the food and water supplies of the inhabitants by allowing pilgrims to enter the city to celebrate [[Passover]], and then refusing them egress. Jewish raids continuously harassed the Roman army, one of which nearly resulted in Titus being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book V#Chapter 2|V.2.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempts by Josephus to negotiate a surrender had failed, the Romans resumed hostilities and quickly breached the first and second walls of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book V#Chapter 6|V.6–V.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; To intimidate the resistance, Titus ordered deserters from the Jewish side to be [[crucifixion|crucified]] around the city wall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book V#Chapter 11|V.11.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the Jews had been exhausted by famine, and when the weak third wall was breached, bitter street fighting ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 2|VI.2–VI.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans finally captured the [[Antonia Fortress]] and began a frontal assault on the gates of [[Second Temple|the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 4|VI.4.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, Titus had ordered that the Temple should not be destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The War of the Jews'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 4|VI.4.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; but while the fighting around the gates continued, a soldier hurled a torch inside one of the windows, which quickly set the entire building ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 4|VI.4.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The later Christian chronicler [[Sulpicius Severus]], possibly drawing on a lost portion of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', claims that Titus favoured the destruction of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulpicius Severus]], ''Chronicles'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sulpiciusseveruschron2.html II].30.6–7. For [[Tacitus]] as the source, see {{Cite journal|author=T.D.

[[Destruction of Jerusalem|Jerusalem was sacked]] and much of the population killed or dispersed. Josephus claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, of which a majority were Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-vi-9&quot;&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 9|VI.9.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; 97,000 were captured and enslaved, including Simon Bar-Giora and John of [[Giscala|Jish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-vi-9&quot;/&gt; Many fled to areas around the [[Mediterranean]]. Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, as he claimed that he had not won the victory on his own, but had been the vehicle through which their God had manifested his wrath against his people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_26.html#%A729 6.29]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Diaspora at the time of the Temple’s destruction, according to [[Josephus]], was in Parthia (Persia), Babylonia (Iraq), Arabia, as well as some Jews beyond the Euphrates and in Adiabene (Kurdistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{PACEJ|text=JW|bookno=1|NorN=W|Wchapter=1|chunkid=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heir to Vespasian===
[[Image:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|thumb|300px|Titus' [[Roman triumph|triumph]] after the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] was celebrated with the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome, which shows the treasures taken from the Temple, including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] and the trumpets of Jericho.]] Unable to sail to Italy during the winter, Titus celebrated elaborate games at [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Berytus]], then travelled to [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] on the [[Euphrates]], where he was presented with a crown by [[Vologases I of Parthia]]. While visiting [[Antioch]] he confirmed the traditional rights of the Jews in that city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 3|VII.3.1]], [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 5|VII.5.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to [[Alexandria]], he stopped in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] to consecrate the sacred bull [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. According to Suetonius, this caused consternation: the ceremony required Titus to wear a diadem, which the Romans associated with monarchy, and the partisanship of Titus's legions had already led to fears that he might rebel against his father. Titus returned quickly to Rome – hoping, says Suetonius, to allay any suspicions about his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Rome in 71, Titus was awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#6 LXV.6]&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by Vespasian and Domitian he rode into the city, enthusiastically saluted by the Roman populace and preceded by a lavish parade containing treasures and captives from the war. Josephus describes a procession with large amounts of gold and silver carried along the route, followed by elaborate re-enactments of the war, Jewish prisoners, and finally the treasures taken from the Temple of Jerusalem, including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] and the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 5|VII.5.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Bar Giora was executed in the [[Forum Romanum|Forum]], after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 5|VII.5.6]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[triumphal arch|triumphal]] [[Arch of Titus]], which stands at one entrance to the Forum, memorializes the victory of Titus.

With Vespasian declared emperor, Titus and his brother Domitian received the title of ''Caesar'' from the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#1 LXV.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sharing [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, Titus held seven [[Roman consul|consul]]ships during Vespasian's reign&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-6&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as his secretary, appearing in the Senate on his behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-6&quot;/&gt; More crucially, he was appointed [[Praetorian prefect]] (commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]]), ensuring their loyalty to the Emperor and further solidifying Vespasian's position as a legitimate ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-6&quot;/&gt;

In this capacity he achieved considerable notoriety in Rome for his violent actions, frequently ordering the execution of suspected traitors on the spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-6&quot;/&gt; When in 79, a plot by [[Aulus Caecina Alienus]] and [[Titus Clodius Eprius Marcellus|Eprius Marcellus]] to overthrow Vespasian was uncovered, Titus invited Alienus to dinner and ordered him to be stabbed before he had even left the room.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#16 LXV.16]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Jewish wars, Titus had begun a love affair with [[Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa I)|Berenice]], sister of [[Agrippa II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-ii-2&quot;/&gt; The [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodians]] had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion, and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian in his campaign to become emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#81|II.81]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 75, she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife. The Romans were wary of the eastern queen and disapproved of their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alexander |last=Canduci |year=2010 |title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Rise and Fall of Rome's Immortal Emperors |publisher=Pier 9, 1998 |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=978-1-74196-598-8 |pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the pair was publicly denounced by [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxv-15&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#66-15 LXV.15]&lt;/ref&gt; but his reputation further suffered.

Vespasian died of an infection on 23 June 79 AD,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#17 LXVI.17]&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately succeeded by his son Titus.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-18&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#18 LXVI.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his many (alleged) vices, many Romans feared that he would be another Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-7&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Against these expectations, however, Titus proved to be an effective Emperor and was well loved by the population, who praised him highly when they found that he possessed the greatest virtues instead of vices.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-7&quot;/&gt;

One of his first acts as Emperor was to order a halt to trials based on treason charges,&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#8 8]&lt;/ref&gt; which had long plagued the [[principate]]. The law of [[treason]], or [[law of majestas]], was originally intended to prosecute those who had corruptly &quot;impaired the people and majesty of Rome&quot; by any revolutionary action.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-i-72&quot;&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#72|I.72]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], however, this custom had been revived and applied to cover [[slander]] and [[libel]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-i-72&quot;/&gt; This led to numerous trials and executions under [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], and Nero, and the formation of networks of informers (''[[Delator]]s''), which terrorized Rome's political system for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt;

Titus put an end to this practice, against himself or anyone else, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way. For I do naught that deserves censure, and I care not for what is reported falsely. As for the emperors who are dead and gone, they will avenge themselves in case anyone does them a wrong, if in very truth they are demigods and possess any power.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#19 LXVI.19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consequently, no [[Roman Senate|senator]]s were put to death during his reign;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19&quot;/&gt; he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]] &quot;for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-9&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#9 9]&lt;/ref&gt; The informants were publicly punished and banished from the city. Titus further prevented abuses by making it unlawful for a person to be [[double jeopardy|tried under different laws for the same offense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt; Finally, when Berenice returned to Rome, he sent her away.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-7&quot;/&gt;

As Emperor he became known for his generosity, and [[Suetonius]] states that upon realising he had brought no benefit to anyone during a whole day he remarked, &quot;Friends, I have lost a day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt;

===Challenges===
[[Image:Pompeii Garden of the Fugitives 02.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Mount Vesuvius#Eruption of 79|79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius]] completely destroyed [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Today plaster casts of actual victims found during excavations are on display in some of the ruins.]]
Although his administration was marked by a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced a number of major disasters during his brief reign. On 24 August 79, two months after his accession, [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Mount Vesuvius erupted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#22 LXVI.22]&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption almost completely destroyed the cities and resort communities around the [[Bay of Naples]]. The cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were buried under metres of stone and [[lava]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#23 LXVI.23]&lt;/ref&gt; killing thousands of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The exact number of casualties is unknown; however, estimates of the population of Pompeii range between 10,000 ([http://enginova.com/engineering_of_pompeii.htm]) and 25,000 ([http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm]), with at least a thousand bodies currently recovered in and around the city ruins.&lt;/ref&gt; Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt; Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-24&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#24 LXVI.24]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second visit, in spring of AD 80, a fire broke out in Rome, burning large parts of the city for three days and three nights.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-24&quot;/&gt; Although the extent of the damage was not as disastrous as during the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire]] of 64—crucially sparing the many districts of [[insulae]]—[[Cassius Dio]] records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]], the [[Diribitorium]], parts of the [[Theatre of Pompey]], and the [[Saepta Julia]] among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-24&quot;/&gt; Once again, Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-24&quot;/&gt; According to Suetonius, a Plague also broke out during the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-8&quot;/&gt; The nature of the disease, however, or the death toll are unknown.

Meanwhile, war had resumed in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], where [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] pushed further into [[Caledonia]] and managed to establish several forts there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' [[wikisource:Agricola#22|22]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his actions, Titus received the title of [[Imperator#Imperator as an imperial title|Imperator]] for the fifteenth time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#20 LXVI.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

His reign also saw the rebellion led by [[Terentius Maximus]], one of several ''false Neros'' who appeared throughout the 70s.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories i-2&quot;&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nero was primarily known as a universally hated tyrant, there is evidence that for much of his reign, he remained highly popular in the eastern provinces. Reports that Nero had in fact survived his overthrow were fueled by the confusing circumstances of his death and several prophecies foretelling his return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Sanford |first = Eva Matthews |title = Nero and the East |journal = Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |volume = 48 | year = 1937 |pages = 75–103 |location = Harvard University |doi = 10.2307/310691 |publisher = Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 48 |jstor=310691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cassius Dio, Terentius Maximus resembled Nero in voice and appearance and, like him, sang to the [[lyre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19&quot;/&gt; Terentius established a following in [[Asia minor]] but was soon forced to flee beyond the [[Euphrates]], taking refuge with the [[Parthia]]ns.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories i-2&quot;/&gt; In addition, sources state that Titus discovered that his brother Domitian was plotting against him but refused to have him killed or banished.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26 LXVI.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|280px|The Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the [[Colosseum]], was completed after 10 years construction during the reign of Titus and inaugurated with spectacular games that lasted for 100 days. See ''[[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre]]''.]]

Construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre, presently better known as the [[Colosseum]], was begun in 70 under [[Vespasian]] and finally completed in 80 under Titus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Leland M. |last=Roth |year=1993 |title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning |edition =First |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=0-06-430158-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing spectacular entertainments to the Roman populace, the building was also conceived as a gigantic triumphal monument to commemorate the military achievements of the Flavians during the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Amanda |last=Claridge |year=1998 |title=Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide |edition =First |publisher=Oxford University Press, 1998 |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=276–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugural games]] lasted for a hundred days and were said to be extremely elaborate, including [[gladiator|gladiatorial combat]], fights between wild animals ([[elephant]]s and [[crane (bird)|cranes]]), [[Naumachia|mock naval battles]] for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-25&quot;&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#25 LXVI.25]&lt;/ref&gt; During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even [[Slavery in antiquity#Slavery in Rome|slaves]]), which could then be traded for the designated item.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-25&quot;/&gt;

Adjacent to the amphitheatre, within the precinct of Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]], Titus had also ordered the construction of a new public [[thermae|bath-house]], the [[Baths of Titus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-25&quot;/&gt; Construction of this building was hastily finished to coincide with the completion of the Flavian Amphitheatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-7&quot;/&gt;

Practice of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] was revived by Titus, though apparently it met with some difficulty as Vespasian was not deified until six months after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Coins bearing the inscription ''Divus Vespasianus'' were not issued until 80 or 81 by Titus.&lt;/ref&gt; To further honor and glorify the [[Flavian dynasty]], foundations were laid for what would later become the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], which was finished by Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian W. The Emperor Titus. New York: St. Martin's P, 1984. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death (81)===
At the closing of the games, Titus officially dedicated the amphitheatre and the baths, which was to be his final recorded act as Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt; He set out for the [[Sabine]] territories but fell ill at the first posting station&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-10&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; where he died of a fever, reportedly in the same farm-house as his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-11&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#11 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the last words he uttered before passing away were: &quot;I have made but one mistake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-10&quot;/&gt;

Titus had ruled the [[Roman Empire]] for just over two years, from the death of his father in 79 to his own on 13 September 81.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt; He was succeeded by [[Domitian]], whose first act as emperor was to [[apotheosis|deify]] his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-2&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#2 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have speculated on the exact nature of his death, and to which mistake Titus alluded in his final words. [[Philostratus]] writes that he was poisoned by Domitian with a sea hare (''[[Aplysia depilans]]''), and that his death had been foretold to him by [[Apollonius of Tyana]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732 6.32]&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius and Cassius Dio maintain he died of natural causes, but both accuse Domitian of having left the ailing Titus for dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-2&quot;/&gt; Consequently, Dio believes Titus's mistake refers to his failure to have his brother executed when he was found to be openly plotting against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt;

The [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Gittin]] 56b) attributes Titus's death to an insect that flew into his nose and picked at his brain for seven years, in a repetition of another legend referring to biblical King [[Nimrod]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosner, Fred.

===Historiography===

[[Image:Arco de Tito.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Arch of Titus]], located on the [[Via Sacra]], just to the south-east of the ''[[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]]'' in Rome.]]

Titus's record among ancient historians stands as one of the most exemplary of any emperor. All the surviving accounts from this period, many of them written by his own contemporaries, present a highly favorable view towards Titus. His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian.

''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' offers a first-hand, eye-witness account of the Jewish rebellion and the character of Titus. The neutrality of [[Josephus]]' writings has come into question however, as he was heavily indebted to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]]. In 71, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, became a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and took on the Roman [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Flavius and [[praenomen]] Titus from his patrons. He received an annual pension and lived in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus]]'' [[wikisource:The Life of Flavius Josephus#76|76]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works. ''The War of the Jews'' is heavily slanted against the leaders of the revolt, portraying the rebellion as weak and unorganized, and even blaming the Jews for causing the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book II#Chapter 17|II.17]]&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility of Josephus as a historian has subsequently come under fire.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Flavius, ''The Jewish War'', tr. G.A. Williamson, introduction by E. Mary Smallwood.  New York, Penguin, 1981, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contemporary of Titus was [[Tacitus|Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], who started his public career in 80 or 81 and credits the Flavian dynasty with his elevation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|The Histories]]''—his account of this period—was published during the reign of [[Trajan]]. Unfortunately only the first five books from this work have survived until the present day, with the text on Titus's and Domitian's reign entirely lost.

[[Suetonius|Suetonius Tranquilius]] gives a short but highly favourable account on Titus's reign in ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-1&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing his military achievements and his generosity as Emperor, in short describing him as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Titus, of the same surname as his father, was the delight and darling of the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, or good fortune, to win the affections of all men, and that, too, which is no easy task, while he was emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-titus-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, [[Cassius Dio]] wrote his ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' over a hundred years after the death of Titus. He shares a similar outlook as Suetonius, possibly even using the latter as a source, but is more reserved, noting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His satisfactory record may also have been due to the fact that he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days—in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of [[Augustus]], since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-18&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]], who later died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm The Destruction of Pompeii, 79 AD], Translation of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s letters. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep6.html Original.]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/plinyepistle.html Preface]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories, in Jewish memory &quot;Titus the Wicked&quot; is remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple.  For example, one legend in the Babylonian Talmud describes Titus as having had sex with a whore on a Torah scroll inside the Temple during its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 56b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titus in later arts===
[[Image:The Triumph of Titus Alma Tadema.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Triumph of Titus'', by Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1885). The composition suggests a love affair between Titus and Domitian's wife [[Domitia Longina]] (see below).]]
The war in Judaea and the life of Titus, particularly his relationship with Berenice, have inspired writers and artists through the centuries. The [[bas-relief]] in the Arch of Titus has been influential in the depiction of the [[destruction of Jerusalem]], with the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] frequently being used to symbolise the looting of the [[Second Temple]].

'''Domitian''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|ʃ|ən|,_|-|i|ən}}; {{lang-la|Titus Flavius Caesar Domitianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Domitian's name would be inscribed as TITVS FLAVIVS CAESAR DOMITIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 24 October 51&amp;nbsp;– 18 September 96) was [[Roman emperor]] from 81 to 96. Domitian was the third and last emperor of the [[Flavian dynasty]].

Domitian's youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his brother [[Titus]], who gained military renown during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]]. This situation continued under the rule of his father [[Vespasian]], who became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. While Titus held a great many offices under the rule of his father, Domitian was left with honours but no responsibilities. Vespasian died in 79 and was succeeded by Titus, whose own reign came to an unexpected end when he was struck by a fatal illness in 81. The following day Domitian was declared Emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]], commencing a reign that lasted fifteen years&amp;nbsp;– longer than any man who had ruled since [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns&lt;/ref&gt;

As Emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of [[Rome]]. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]. Domitian's government exhibited [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] characteristics; he saw himself as the new [[Augustus]], an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]].

Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day he was succeeded by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]] and [[Suetonius]] published histories propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists have instead characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful 2nd century.

==Early life==

===Family===
[[Image:Flavian family tree.png|thumb|450px|The [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian family]] tree, indicating the descendants of [[Titus Flavius Petro]] and Tertulla.]]
Domitian was born in [[Rome]] on 24 October 51, the youngest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]—commonly known as Vespasian—and [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla Major]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-1&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older sister, [[Domitilla the Younger]], and brother, also named [[Titus|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Townend (1961), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-3&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; One such family, the Flavians, or ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Domitian's great-grandfather, [[Titus Flavius Petro]], had served as a [[centurion]] under [[Pompey]] during [[Caesar's civil war]]. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-1&quot;/&gt;

Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus I]], Domitian's grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-2&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status through his services as [[tax collector]] in Asia and banker in [[Helvetia]] (modern Switzerland). By marrying [[Vespasia Polla]] he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious ''gens Vespasia'', ensuring the elevation of his sons [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus II]] and Vespasian to [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Domitian Denarius.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[denarius]] of Domitian.]]
The [[cursus honorum|political career]] of Vespasian included the offices of [[quaestor]], [[aedile]], and [[praetor]], and culminated with a [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 51, the year of Domitian's birth. As a military commander, Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing,&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors [[Caligula]] (37–41) and [[Nero]] (54–68).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]
&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a [[propaganda]] campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (41–54) and his son [[Britannicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

By all appearances, the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as [[proconsul]] of the [[Africa Province|Africa province]] in 63, and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of [[Greece]] in 66.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year the Jews of the [[Iudaea Province|Judaea province]] revolted against the Roman Empire in what is now known as the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. Vespasian was assigned to lead the [[Roman army]] against the insurgents, with Titus — who had completed his military education by this time — in charge of a legion.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-11&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth and character===
[[Image:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of [[Vespasian]] ([[Pushkin Museum]]).]]
By the time he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died,&lt;ref&gt;Waters (1964), pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-13&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (2003), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]]. In his biography in the ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as [[Homer]] or [[Virgil]] on appropriate occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#9 9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#12.3 12.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#20 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Among his first published works were [[poetry]], as well as writings on law and administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-13&quot;/&gt;

Unlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court. Whether he received formal military training is not recorded, but according to Suetonius, he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow.&lt;ref name=jones-16&gt;Jones (1992), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-19&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed description of Domitian's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius, who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality.

{{quote|text=He was tall of stature, with a modest expression and a high colour. His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness.&lt;br&gt;
:[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', &quot;Life of Domitian&quot;, 18}}

Domitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1997), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of [[hair care]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-18&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#18 18]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.&lt;ref name=jones-198&gt;Jones (1992), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Brian Jones concludes in ''The Emperor Domitian'' that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources.&lt;ref name=jones-198/&gt; Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] sense of humour,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1997), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-21&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt; and often communicated in cryptic ways.

This ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-13&quot;/&gt; Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the [[civil war]] of 69, which brought his family to power.&lt;ref name=waters-54&gt;Waters (1964), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of the Flavian dynasty==

===Year of the Four Emperors===
[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|The Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69). Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus]]. Green areas indicate provinces loyal to [[Vitellius]].]]
On 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed [[suicide]] and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], during which the four most influential generals in the [[Roman Empire]]—[[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]] and Vespasian—successively vied for imperial power.&lt;ref name=sullivan-69&gt;Sullivan (1953), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of [[Jerusalem]]. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.&lt;ref name=sullivan-69&gt;Sullivan (1953), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Before reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of [[Lusitania]] (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt;

Otho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital [[History of Roman Egypt|province of Egypt]], which controlled the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]]. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire [[Cohortes urbanae|city garrison]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-11&quot;/&gt; Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;

When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]], the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.&lt;ref name=sullivan-68&gt;Sullivan (1953), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.&lt;ref name=sullivan-68/&gt; A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pseudo-Vitellius Louvre MR684.jpg|thumb|A bust of Emperor [[Vitellius]], ([[Louvre]]).]]
In Rome, Domitian was placed under [[house arrest]] by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression.&lt;ref name=waters-54/&gt; Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian met at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum#Second Battle of Bedriacum|Second Battle of Bedriacum]], which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#34|III.34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard—the imperial [[bodyguard]]—considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2000), pp. 166, 189&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the [[Temple of Concord]] but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the [[Capitoline Hill]].&lt;ref name=jones-14&gt;Jones (1992), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of [[Isis]] and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.&lt;ref name=jones-14/&gt;

By the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house.&lt;ref name=jones-14/&gt; The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (1956), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of the war===
[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 047b.jpg|thumb|''The Conspiracy of [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]'' (detail), by [[Rembrandt]] (1661). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory, but was denied command of a legion by superior officers.]]

Although the war had officially ended, a state of [[anarchy]] and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year.&lt;ref name=jones-14/&gt; In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of ''Caesar'' and was appointed praetor with consular power.&lt;ref name=jones-15&gt;Jones (1992), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient historian [[Tacitus]] describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian's authority was merely [[wikt:Nominal|nominal]], however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function.&lt;ref name=jones-15/&gt; Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's [[wikt:Entourage|entourage]], promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and [[Antonius Primus]] and replacing them by more reliable men such as [[Marcus Arrecinus Clemens (prefect 70)|Arrecinus Clemens]].&lt;ref name=jones-15/&gt;

Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the [[Batavian rebellion|Batavian revolt]] in [[Gaul]]. [[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].&lt;ref name=jones-16/&gt;

Although the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#68|IV.68]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours.&lt;ref name=jones-16/&gt; Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed.&lt;ref name=jones-16/&gt; With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.&lt;ref name=jones-17&gt;Jones (1992), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===

[[Image:Domitia.JPG|thumb|200px|A bust of [[Domitia Longina]], with Flavian [[hairstyle]], ([[Louvre]]).]]
Where his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, [[Julia Flavia]],&lt;ref name=jones-33&gt;Jones (1992), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; but Domitian was adamant in his love for [[Domitia Longina]], going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself.&lt;ref name=jones-33/&gt; Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83.&lt;ref name=jones-36&gt;Jones (1993), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' upon Domitia, while their son was [[apotheosis|deified]], appearing as such on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of coin types from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly [[exile]]d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia.&lt;ref name=jones-39&gt;Jones (1992), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir.&lt;ref name=jones-36/&gt; By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace,&lt;ref&gt;Varner (1995), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the [[amphitheatre]], while the [[Judaism|Jewish]] writer [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] speaks of benefits he received from her.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-37&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to have been happy.&lt;ref name=jones-35&gt;Jones (1992), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial heir (71–81)===

[[Vespasian]] proceeds at the head of the family, dressed as [[pontifex maximus]], followed by Domitian with [[Domitia Longina]], and finally [[Titus]], also dressed in religious regalia.]]

Prior to becoming Emperor, Domitian's role in the Flavian government was largely ceremonial. In June 71, Titus returned triumphant from the war in Judaea. Ultimately, the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people, a majority of whom were Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-vi-9&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''The Wars of the Jews'' [[s:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 9|VI.9.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; The city and [[Second Temple|temple of Jerusalem]] were completely destroyed, its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army, and nearly 100,000 people were captured and enslaved.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-wars-vi-9&quot;/&gt;

For his victory, the Senate awarded Titus a [[Roman triumph]]. On the day of the festivities, the Flavian family rode into the capital, preceded by a lavish parade that displayed the spoils of the war.&lt;ref name=jospehus-war-7-5-5&gt;Josephus, ''The Wars of the Jews'' [[s:The War of the Jews/Book VII#Chapter 5|VII.5.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The family procession was headed by Vespasian and Titus, while Domitian, riding a magnificent white horse, followed with the remaining Flavian relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#2 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Jewish resistance were executed in the [[Forum Romanum]], after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=jospehus-war-7-5-5/&gt; A [[triumphal arch]], the [[Arch of Titus]], was erected at the south-east entrance to the Forum to commemorate the successful end of the war.&lt;ref name=jones-93&gt;Jones (1992), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the return of Titus further highlighted the comparative insignificance of Domitian, both militarily and politically. As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, received seven consulships, the [[Roman censor|censorship]], and was given [[Praetorian prefect|command]] of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire.&lt;ref name=jones-18&gt;Jones (1992), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as ''Caesar'' or ''Princeps Iuventutis'', and several priesthoods, including those of ''[[augur]]'', ''[[pontifex]]'', ''[[Arval Brethren|frater arvalis]]'', ''magister frater arvalium'', and ''sacerdos collegiorum omnium'',&lt;ref name=jones-19/&gt; but no office with ''[[imperium]]''.

He held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious [[suffect consul]]ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January.&lt;ref name=jones-18/&gt; While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.&lt;ref name=jones-19&gt;Jones (1992), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Crook |first = John A. |title = Titus and Berenice |journal = The American Journal of Philology |volume = 72 |issue = 2 |pages = 162–175 |year = 1951|doi = 10.2307/292544 |jstor=292544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=jones-163&gt;Jones (1992), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor ''imperium'' of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.&lt;ref name=jones-20&gt;Jones (1992), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The new Emperor was not eager to alter this arrangement: he was under forty and at the height of his power.

Two major disasters struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, [[79 eruption of Vesuvius|Mount Vesuvius erupted]],&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#22 LXVI.22]&lt;/ref&gt; burying the surrounding cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings.&lt;ref name=jones-80&gt;Jones (1992), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property. On 13 September 81 after barely two years in office, he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the [[Sabine]] territories.&lt;ref name=jones-20/&gt;

Ancient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother, either by directly accusing him of murder,&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732 6.32]&lt;/ref&gt; or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead,&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26 LXVI.26]&lt;/ref&gt; even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26&quot;/&gt; It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known [[bias]] of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.&lt;ref name=jones-20/&gt;

Whatever the nature of their relationship, Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], and the titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', and ''[[Pater Patriae]]''.&lt;ref name=jones-21&gt;Jones (1992), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor (81–96)==

===Rule===
{{Flavian dynasty
|image=
|caption=
}}
As Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign.&lt;ref name=jones-22&gt;Jones (1992), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine monarchy]] with himself as the [[Enlightened absolutism|benevolent despot]] at its head.

In addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the Emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and [[moral authority]].&lt;ref name=jones-99&gt;Jones (1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=jones-72&gt;Jones (1992), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: [[edict]]s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced.&lt;ref name=jones-107&gt;Jones (1992), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, the imperial [[bureaucracy]] never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] and elected officials.&lt;ref name=jones-109&gt;Jones (1992), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the [[nepotism]] practiced by Vespasian and Titus.&lt;ref name=jones-164&gt;Jones (1992), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.&lt;ref name=jones-178&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital.&lt;ref name=jones-150/&gt; Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was.&lt;ref name=jones-22/&gt; Until the completion of the [[Flavian Palace]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.&lt;ref name=jones-26&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
[[Image:Domitian denarius son.png|thumb|250px|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman currency by increasing the silver content of the [[denarius]] by 12%. This coin commemorates the [[apotheosis|deification]] of Domitian's son.]]

Domitian's tendency towards [[micromanagement]] was nowhere more evident than in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign.&lt;ref name=jones-73&gt;Jones (1992), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his accession he revalued the [[Roman currency]] dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.26&amp;nbsp;grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a [[devaluation]] of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04&amp;nbsp;grams respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones-75&gt;Jones (1992), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the new values were still higher than the levels that Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.&lt;ref name=jones-75/&gt; Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.&lt;ref name=jones-75/&gt;

Jones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion [[sestertius|sestertii]], of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.&lt;ref name=jones-73/&gt; The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome. At the time of Domitian's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64]], the civil war of 69 and the fire in 79.&lt;ref name = jones-79/&gt;

Much more than a renovation project, Domitian's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural [[renaissance]]. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus.&lt;ref name=jones-79&gt;Jones (1992), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most important new structures were an [[Odeon of Domitian|odeon]], a [[Stadium of Domitian|stadium]], and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect [[Rabirius (architect)|Rabirius]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a [[gilding|gilded]] roof. Among those completed were the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], the Arch of Titus and the [[Colosseum]], to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.&lt;ref name=jones-93/&gt;

In order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or ''[[congiarium|congiaria]]'', throughout Domitian's reign.&lt;ref name=jones-74&gt;Jones (1992), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the [[Capitoline Games]], a quadrennial contest comprising [[Athletic sport|athletic displays]], [[chariot racing]], and competitions for [[Public speaking|oratory]], music and acting.&lt;ref name=jones-103&gt;Jones (1992), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular [[gladiator]]ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.&lt;ref name=jones-105&gt;Jones (1992), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military campaigns===
[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|A rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, [[Azerbaijan]], mentioning Domitian and [[Legio XII Fulminata]]. Cf. [[Caucasian Albania]]]]
The military campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare.&lt;ref name = jones-127/&gt; His most significant military contribution was the development of the [[Limes Germanicus]], which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire.&lt;ref name=jones-131&gt;Jones (1992), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the [[Chatti]], and across the [[Danube]] frontier against the [[Suebi]], the [[Sarmatians]], and the [[Dacians]].&lt;ref name = jones-130/&gt;

The conquest of Britain continued under the command of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], who expanded the Roman Empire as far as [[Caledonia]], or modern day [[Scotland]]. Domitian also founded a new [[Roman legion|legion]] in 82, the [[Legio I Minervia]], to fight against the Chatti.&lt;ref name = jones-130/&gt; Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman presence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Millar|first =Fergus|title =Rome, the Greek World, and the East: The Roman Republic and the Augustan revolution|publisher = UNC Press Books|year = 2002|page = 51|isbn = 0-8078-4990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]. As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.

Domitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however.&lt;ref name=jones-127&gt;Jones (1992), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a &quot;mock triumph&quot;, and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-39&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#39|39]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and raising their pay by one-third.&lt;ref name=jones-131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1930), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.&lt;ref name=jones-144&gt;Jones (1992), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Campaign against the Chatti====
Once Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a [[census]], and suddenly ordered an attack on the Chatti.&lt;ref name=jones-128&gt;Jones (1992), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75&amp;nbsp;kilometres (46&amp;nbsp;mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.&lt;ref name=jones-130&gt;Jones (1992), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of ''Germanicus''.&lt;ref name=jones-129&gt;Jones (1992), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as &quot;uncalled for&quot;,&lt;ref name=suetonius-domitian-6&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;mock triumph&quot;.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/&gt; The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.&lt;ref name=jones-131/&gt;

====Conquest of Britain (77–84)====
[[Image:Statue of Agricola at Bath cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]).]]
{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}
One of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84.&lt;ref name=jones-131/&gt; Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).

In 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-1&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]&lt;/ref&gt; He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].&lt;ref name=jones-132&gt;Jones (1992), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was in fact a small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Reed |first = Nicholas |title = The Fifth Year of Agricola's Campaigns |journal = Britannia |volume = 2 |year = 1971 |pages = 143–148 |jstor = 525804|doi =10.2307/525804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning his attention from Ireland, the following year Agricola raised a fleet and pushed beyond the [[River Forth|Forth]] into Caledonia. To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]].&lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt; In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-2&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#29|29]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.&lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt;

In 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era.&lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt; Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/&gt; The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&amp;nbsp;kilometres (75&amp;nbsp;mi) further south.&lt;ref name=jones-133&gt;Jones (1992), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.&lt;ref name=jones-131/&gt;

====Dacian wars (85–88)====
{{details|Domitian's Dacian War}}

[[Image:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right.]]
The most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]].&lt;ref name=jones-138&gt;Jones (1992), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.&lt;ref name=jones-139&gt;Jones (1992), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia, which resulted in the complete destruction of the fifth legion, [[Legio V Alaudae]], in the [[First Battle of Tapae]]. Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost.&lt;ref name=jones-141&gt;Jones (1992), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.

Domitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished.&lt;ref name=jones-142&gt;Jones (1992), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.&lt;ref name=jones-150&gt;Jones (1992), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces.&lt;ref name=jones-150&gt;Jones (1992), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged.&lt;ref name=jones-195&gt;Jones (1992), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.&lt;ref name=Salmon/&gt;

Domitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. [[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Knight |first = D. J. |title = The Movements of the Auxilia from Augustus to Hadrian |journal = Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik |volume = 85 |year = 1991 |pages = 189–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Matei-Popescu |first = Florian |title = The Auxiliary Units from Moesia Superior in Domitian's Time and the Problem of CIL XVI 41 |journal = Ephemeris Napocensis |volume = 16–17 |year = 2006–2007 |pages = 31–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.&lt;ref name=Salmon&gt;{{cite journal |last = Salmon |first = Edward Togo |title = Trajan's Conquest of Dacia |journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume = 67 |pages = 83–105 |year = 1936 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor = 283229 |doi = 10.2307/283229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious policy===

Domitian firmly believed in the traditional [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], and personally saw to it that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],&lt;ref name=jones-99/&gt; perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''.&lt;ref name=jones-88&gt;Jones (1992), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.&lt;ref name=jones-100&gt;Jones (1992), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7&lt;/ref&gt; However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,&lt;ref name=jones-108&gt;Jones (1992), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.&lt;ref name=jones-109&gt;Jones (1992), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],&lt;ref name=jones-87&gt;Jones (1992), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother.&lt;ref name=jones-93/&gt; To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.

Construction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct.&lt;ref name=jones-106&gt;Jones (1992), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.&lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt;

Domitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected.&lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt; He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death.&lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt; Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public.

In 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]].&lt;ref name=jones-101&gt;Jones (1992), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of [[Commodus]]. Veneration of [[Serapis]] and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.&lt;ref name=jones-100/&gt;

4th century writings by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] maintain that Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]] were heavily [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Domitian|persecuted]] toward the end of Domitian's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eusebius of Caessarea |first = |authorlink = Eusebius of Caesarea |title = Church History |year = 425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Smallwood |first = E.M. |title = 'Domitian's attitude towards the Jews and Judaism |journal = Classical Philology |volume = 51 |pages = 1–13 |year = 1956 |doi = 10.1086/363978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Revelation]] is thought by some to have been written during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Brown |first = Raymond E. |authorlink = Raymond E. Brown |title = An Introduction to the New Testament |publisher = Doubleday |year = 1997 |pages = 805–809 |location = New York |isbn = 0-385-24767-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jews were heavily taxed, no contemporary authors mention trials or executions based on [[religious offense]]s other than those within the Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===

====Revolt of Governor Saturninus (89)====
[[Image:Domitian capitoline profile left.png|thumb|Domitian, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]
On 1 January 89, the governor of [[Germania Superior]], [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus]], and his two legions at [[Mainz]], [[Legio XIV Gemina]] and [[Legio XXI Rapax]], revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of the Germanic Chatti people.&lt;ref name=jones-144/&gt; The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it appears to have been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of [[appeasement]] towards Decebalus.&lt;ref name=jones-145&gt;Jones (1992), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of Germania Inferior]], Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.&lt;ref name=jones-146&gt;Jones (1992), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

By a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid.&lt;ref name=jones-146&gt;Jones (1992), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.&lt;ref name=jones-149&gt;Jones (1992), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Lappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with [[Titus Petronius Secundus]] as his colleague.&lt;ref name=jones-148&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grainger 2003, p. 30&quot;&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grainger 2003, p. 30&quot;/&gt; His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Murison (2003), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.

====Relationship with the Senate====
Since the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the [[Principate]]. The Principate allowed the existence of a ''de facto'' dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Waters |first = K. H. |title = The Second Dynasty of Rome |journal = Phoenix |volume = 17 |issue = 3 |year = 1963 |publisher = Classical Association of Canada |jstor = 1086720 |doi = 10.2307/1086720 |pages = 198–218 [201] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a ''de facto'' monarch.&lt;ref name=jones-161&gt;Jones (1992), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rulers handled this arrangement with less subtlety than others. Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his [[autocracy]].&lt;ref name=jones-161&gt;Jones (1992), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.&lt;ref name=jones-169&gt;Jones (1992), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion [[Damnatio memoriae|condemning his memory]] to oblivion.&lt;ref name=jones-160&gt;Jones (1992), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.&lt;ref name=jones-161/&gt;

Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul.&lt;ref name=jones-163-8&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 163–168&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name=jones-169/&gt;

Both Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89.&lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-45&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#45|45]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suetonius-domitian-10&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed,&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of senatorial victims, see Jones (1992), pp. 182–188&lt;/ref&gt; including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 69)|Titus Flavius Sabinus IV]], [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens.&lt;ref&gt;M. Arrecinus Clemens may have been exiled instead of executed, see Jones (1992), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85 however, lending little credit to Tacitus' notion of a &quot;reign of terror&quot; late in Domitian's reign. According to Suetonius, some were convicted for corruption or treason, others on trivial charges, which Domitian justified through his suspicion:

{{quote|text=He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been murdered.
:[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', &quot;Life of Domitian&quot;, 21}}

Jones compares the executions of Domitian to those under Emperor [[Claudius]] (41–55), noting that Claudius executed around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good Emperors of history.&lt;ref name=jones-192&gt;Jones (1992), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.&lt;ref name=jones-192/&gt;

==Death and succession==

===Assassination (96)===
[[Image:Athena ciste.jpg|thumb|According to Suetonius, Domitian worshipped [[Minerva]] as his protector goddess with superstitious veneration. In a [[dream]], she is said to have abandoned the emperor prior to the [[assassination]].]]
Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96, in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-193&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that Domitian's chamberlain Parthenius was the chief instigator behind the conspiracy, citing the recent execution of Domitian's secretary [[Epaphroditos|Epaphroditus]] as the primary motive.&lt;ref name=grainger-16&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-14&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#14 14;16]&lt;/ref&gt; The murder itself was carried out by a freedman of Parthenius named Maximus, and a steward of Domitian's niece [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Flavia Domitilla]], named Stephanus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grainger 2003, p. 19&quot;&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise involvement of the Praetorian Guard is less clear. At the time the Guard was commanded by Titus Flavius Norbanus and Titus Petronius Secundus and the latter was almost certainly aware of the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grainger 2003, p. 19&quot;/&gt; Cassius Dio, writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination, includes Domitia Longina among the conspirators, but in light of her attested devotion to Domitian—even years after her husband had died—her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-37&quot; /&gt;

Dio further suggests that the assassination was improvised, while Suetonius implies a well-organized conspiracy.&lt;ref name=grainger-5&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; For some days before the attack took place, Stephanus feigned an injury so as to be able to conceal a [[dagger]] beneath his bandages. On the day of the assassination the doors to the servants' quarters were locked while Domitian's personal weapon of last resort, a sword he concealed beneath his pillow, had been removed in advance.&lt;ref name=grainger-1-3&gt;Grainger (2003), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with an [[astrology|astrological]] prediction the Emperor believed that he would die around noon, and was therefore restless during this time of the day. On his last day, Domitian was feeling disturbed and asked a servant several times what time it was. The boy, included in the plot, lied, saying that it was much later than noon.&lt;ref name=grainger-1-3/&gt; More at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees, where he was suddenly approached by Stephanus:

{{quote|text=Then pretending to betray a conspiracy and for that reason being given an audience, [Stephanus] stabbed the emperor in the groin as he was reading a paper which the assassin handed him, and stood in a state of amazement. As the wounded prince attempted to resist, he was slain with seven wounds by Clodianus, a subaltern, Maximus, a freedman of Parthenius, Satur, decurion of the chamberlains, and a gladiator from the imperial school.
:[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', &quot;Life of Domitian&quot;, 17}}

Domitian and Stephanus wrestled on the ground for some time, until the Emperor was finally overpowered and fatally stabbed by the conspirators; Stephanus was stabbed by Domitian during the struggle and died shortly afterward. Around noon Domitian, just one month short of his 45th birthday, was dead. His body was carried away on a common [[bier]], and unceremoniously [[cremation|cremated]] by his nurse Phyllis, who later mingled the ashes with those of his niece Julia, at the Flavian temple.&lt;ref name=jones-38&gt;Jones (1992), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Suetonius, a number of [[omen]]s had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, Minerva had appeared to him in a dream, announcing she had been disarmed by Jupiter and would no longer be able to protect him.&lt;ref name=jones-100/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-15&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#15 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession and aftermath===
[[Image:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg|thumb|250px|Upon the death of Domitian, [[Nerva]] was proclaimed Emperor by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].]]

The ''[[Fasti|Fasti Ostienses]]'', the Ostian Calendar, records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-153&quot;&gt;Murison (2003), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-151&quot;&gt;Murison (2003), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), pp. 4–27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cassius Dio, the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination, suggesting that he was at least aware of the plot.&lt;ref name=jones-194&gt;Jones (1992), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/67*.html#15 LXVII.15]&lt;/ref&gt; He does not appear in Suetonius' version of the events, but this may be understandable, since his works were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian. To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.&lt;ref name=jones-194/&gt;

On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Syme |first = Ronald |title = Domitian: The Last Years |journal = Chiron |volume = 13 |pages = 121–146 |year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-153&quot;/&gt; The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-196&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed ''damnatio memoriae'' on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.&lt;ref name=grainger-49&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian and, over a century later [[Publius Septimius Geta]], were the only emperors known to have officially received a ''damnatio memoriae'', though others may have received ''de facto'' ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Last |first = Hugh |title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria |journal = The Journal of Roman Studies |volume = 38 |issue = 1–2 |pages = 9–14 |publisher = Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |year = 1948 |jstor = 298163|doi = 10.2307/298163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.&lt;ref name=grainger-49/&gt;

According to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.&lt;ref name=grainger-94&gt;Grainger (2003), pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.&lt;ref name=grainger-94/&gt; Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but [[abdication|abdicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Syme |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Syme |title = Guard Prefects of Trajan and Hadrian |journal = The Journal of Roman Studies |volume = 70 |year = 1980|doi = 10.2307/299556 |jstor=299556 |pages = 64–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Ancient sources===
[[Image:Domitian statue Vatican.png|thumb|Domitian as Emperor ([[Vatican Museums]]), possibly recut from a statue of Nero.]]
The classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations.&lt;ref name=jones-160/&gt; Furthermore, contemporary historians such as [[Pliny the Younger]], Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets [[Martial]] and [[Statius]] constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117–138). His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror.&lt;ref&gt;Waters (1964), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The biography is problematic however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent [[libertine]].&lt;ref name=jones-198/&gt;

According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.&lt;ref name=jones-198/&gt;

''De Vita Caesarum'' is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named [[Paris (actor under Domitian)|Paris]]. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=jones-35/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-22&quot;&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#22 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (2002), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.

Although Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.&lt;ref name=jones-58&gt;Jones (1992), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.&lt;ref name=jones-58/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Dorey |first = T. A. |title = Agricola and Domitian |journal = Greece &amp; Rome |volume = 7 |issue = 1 |year = 1960 |pages = 66–71 |jstor = 640729 |doi=10.1017/s0017383500014029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus' major historical works, including ''The Histories'' and Agricola's biography, were all written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' ''Histories'' dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in ''Agricola'' in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-histories-i-1&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential 2nd century authors include [[Juvenal]] and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous ''Panygericus Traiani'' before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]].

===Modern revisionism===
Hostile views of Domitian were propagated until well into the early 20th century, before [[archeology|archeological]] and [[numismatics|numismatic]] advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. In 1930, [[Ronald Syme]] argued a complete reassessment of Domitian's financial policy, which had until then been largely viewed as a disaster, opening his paper with the following introduction:

{{quote|text=The work of the spade and the use of common sense have done much to mitigate the influence of Tacitus and Pliny and redeem the memory of Domitian from infamy or oblivion. But much remains to be done.&lt;br&gt;
:[[Ronald Syme]], ''Imperial finances under Domitian, Nerva and Trajan''}}

Over the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated. New book length studies were not published until the 1990s however, nearly a hundred years after [[Stéphane Gsell]]'s ''Essai sur le règne de l'empereur Domitien'' (1894). The most important of these was ''The Emperor Domitian'', by Brian W. Jones. In his [[monograph]], Jones concludes that Domitian was a ruthless, but efficient autocrat.&lt;ref name=gowing-domitian-review&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gowing |first = Alain M. |title = Review: The Emperor Domitian |journal = Bryn Mawr Classical Review |location = University of Washington |year = 1992 |url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1992/03.06.10.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of his reign, there was no widespread dissatisfaction with the emperor or his rule. His harshness was felt by only a small, but highly vocal minority, who later exaggerated his despotism in favour of the well-regarded [[Nervan-Antonian dynasty]] that followed.&lt;ref name=gowing-domitian-review/&gt;

Domitian's foreign policy was realistic, rejecting expansionist warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest. His economic program, which was rigorously efficient, maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve. Persecution of religious minorities, such as Jews and Christians, was non-existent.&lt;ref name=jones-114-119&gt;Jones (1992), pp. 114–119&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian's government nonetheless exhibited [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] characteristics. As Emperor, he saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of Flavian renaissance.&lt;ref name=jones-72/&gt;

Religious, military and cultural propaganda fostered a [[cult of personality]]. He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the Flavian achievements. Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature.&lt;ref name=jones-127/&gt; By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.&lt;ref name=jones-106/&gt;

He became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from [[delatores|informers]] to bring false charges of treason if necessary.&lt;ref name=jones-180&gt;Jones (1992), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Although contemporary historians vilified Domitian after his death, his administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a &quot;gloomy coda to the...1st century&quot;&lt;ref name=gowing-domitian-review/&gt; the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign that [[Theodor Mommsen]] described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1930), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nervo-Trajanic Dynasty}}
'''Nerva''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Cocceius Nerva Caesar Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Nerva's name would be inscribed as MARCVS COCCEIVS NERVA CAESAR AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 8 November, 30 AD – 27 January, 98 AD), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 96 to 98. Nerva became Emperor at the age of sixty-five, after a lifetime of imperial service under [[Nero]] and the rulers of the [[Flavian dynasty]]. Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] of 65. Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained [[Roman consul|consulships]] in 71 and 90 during the reigns of [[Vespasian]] and [[Domitian]] respectively.

On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and several of his [[freedman|freedmen]]. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the [[Roman Senate]]. This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor. As the new ruler of the [[Roman Empire]], he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian.

Nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the [[Roman army]]. A revolt by the [[Praetorian Guard]] in October 97 essentially forced him to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopt]] an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted [[Trajan]], a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and [[apotheosis|deified]] by Trajan.

Although much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient [[historian]]s. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death, thus founding the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]].

== Early career ==

=== Family ===
Marcus Cocceius Nerva was born in the village of [[Narni]], 50&amp;nbsp;kilometers north of Rome, to the family of Marcus Cocceius Nerva, [[Suffect Consul]] in 40, and Sergia Plautilla.&lt;ref name=grainger-29&gt;Grainger (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Aurelius Victor]] records the year as 35, [[Cassius Dio]] as 30. The latter has been more widely accepted&quot; (Wend, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/nerva.htm#N_2_ n. 2]). [[Ronald Syme]] considered the dates of Nerva's later offices more consistent with 35; see {{ cite book |last = Syme |first = Ronald |title = Tacitus |location = Oxford |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1958 |isbn = 0-19-814327-3 |pages = 653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had at least one attested sister, named Cocceia, who married [[Titianus|Lucius Salvius Titianus Otho]], the brother of the future Emperor [[Otho]].&lt;ref name=grainger-29/&gt;

Like [[Vespasian]], the founder of the [[Flavian dynasty]], Nerva was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome.&lt;ref name=syme-rubellius-83&gt;Syme (1982), p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Cocceia (gens)|Cocceii]] were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and early Empire, attaining consulships in each successive generation. The direct ancestors of Nerva on his father's side, all named [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BC–AD 14).&lt;ref name=grainger-28&gt;Grainger (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (consul 36 BC)|great-grandfather]] was [[Roman consul|Consul]] in 36 BC (in replacement, and abdicated), and Governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in the same year. [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|His grandfather]] became [[Roman consul|Consul]] Suffect in 21 or 22 July, and was known as a personal friend of Emperor [[Tiberius]] (AD 14–37), accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on [[Capri]] from 23 onwards, dying in 33. Nerva's father, finally, attained the consulship in 40 under emperor [[Caligula]] (37–41).&lt;ref name=&quot;grainger-28&quot;/&gt; The Cocceii were connected with the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] through the marriage of Sergia Plautilla's brother Octavius Laenas, and [[Rubellia Bassa]], the great-granddaughter of Tiberius.&lt;ref name=syme-rubellius-83/&gt;

=== Imperial service ===
Not much of Nerva's early life or career is recorded, but it appears he did not pursue the [[cursus honorum|usual administrative]] or military career. He was [[praetor]]-elect in the year 65 and, like his ancestors, moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist.&lt;ref name=grainger-29/&gt; As an advisor to Emperor [[Nero]], he successfully helped detect and expose the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] of 65. Exactly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable, since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero's guard prefect [[Tigellinus]]. He received [[Roman triumph|triumphal honors]]—which was usually reserved for military victories—and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace.&lt;ref name=grainger-29/&gt;

According to the contemporary poet [[Martial]], Nero also held Nerva's literary abilities in high esteem, hailing him as the &quot;[[Tibullus]] of our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=murison-148&gt;Murison (1003), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent member of Nero's entourage was Vespasian, an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 40s. It appears Vespasian befriended Nerva during his time as an imperial advisor, and may have asked him to watch over Vespasian's youngest son [[Domitian]] when Vespasian departed for the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish war]] in 67.&lt;ref name=murison-149&gt;Murison (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;149&lt;/ref&gt;

The suicide of Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, leading to the chaotic [[Year of the Four Emperors]], which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors [[Galba]], [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]], until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.&lt;ref name=murison-150&gt;Murison (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt;

For services unknown, he was rewarded with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, but also because it was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian.&lt;ref name=murison-150/&gt; After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons [[Titus]] (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).

He re-emerges during the revolt of Saturninus in 89. On 1 January, 89, the governor of [[Germania Superior]], [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus]], and his two legions at [[Mainz]], [[Legio XIV Gemina]] and [[Legio XXI Rapax]], revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the [[Chatti]].&lt;ref name=jones-144&gt;Jones (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;144&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of]] [[Germania Inferior]], [[Lappius Maximus]], moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], [[Titus Flavius Norbanus]]. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.&lt;ref name=jones-149&gt;Jones (1992), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime.&lt;ref name=murison-150/&gt; The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.

== Emperor ==

=== Accession ===
[[File:Domitian bust capitoline.png|thumb|250px|A bust of emperor [[Domitian]]. [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]

On 18 September, 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-193&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Fasti|Fasti Ostienses]]'', the Ostian Calendar, records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-153&quot;&gt;Murison (2003), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-151&quot;&gt;Murison (2003), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), pp. 4–27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cassius Dio, the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination, which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot.&lt;ref name=jones-194&gt;Jones (1992), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/67*.html#15 LXVII.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder.&lt;ref name=jones-194/&gt; On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Syme |first = Ronald |title = Domitian: The Last Years |journal = Chiron |volume = 13 |pages = 121–146 |year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-153&quot;/&gt;

Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless.&lt;ref name=jones-domitian-195&gt;Jones (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;195&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the [[anarchy]] which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk [[rebellion|revolt]]s, he accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;murison-156&quot;&gt;Murison, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against Domitian.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-196&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accession of Nerva as emperor, the Senate passed ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Domitian:  his coins and statues were melted, his [[arch]]es were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-23&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-1&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#1 LXVIII.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva. This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Last |first = Hugh |title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria |format = subscription required |journal = The Journal of Roman Studies |volume = 38 |issue = 1–2 |pages = 9–14 |publisher = Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |year = 1948 |url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/298163 |accessdate = 2008-06-08 |doi = 10.2307/298163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the vast palace which Domitian had erected on the [[Palatine Hill]], known as the [[Flavian Palace]], was renamed the &quot;House of the People&quot;, and Nerva himself took up residence in Vespasian's former villa in the [[Gardens of Sallust]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Panegyricus'' 47.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===

The visible door frame is not an original element but rather one of the many modifications suffered during the Middle Ages.]]

The change of government was welcome particularly to the senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-2&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#2 LXVIII.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He called an end to trials based on [[Law of majestas|treason]], released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted [[amnesty]] to many who had been [[exile]]d.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-1&quot;/&gt;

All properties which had been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-1&quot;/&gt; Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government, but this was not entirely successful. He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted, and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-Domitianic faction of the Senate, he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last = Wend |first = David |title = Nerva (96–98 A.D.) |year = 1997 |url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/nerva.htm |accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-3&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#3 LXVIII.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace. As was custom by this time, a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army. Accordingly, a ''[[congiarium]]'' of 75 [[denarius|denarii]] per head was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a ''[[donativum]]'' which may have amounted to as much as 5000 [[denarius|denarii]] per person.&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-65&quot;&gt;Syme (1930), p. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete overview of financial reforms, see {{ cite book |last = Merlin |first = Alfred |title = Les Revers Monétaires de l'Empereur Nerva |location = Paris |year = 1906 |url = http://www.inumis.com/rome/books/merlin/index.html |format = '''French''' |accessdate = 2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the poorest, Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million [[Sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-2&quot;/&gt; He exempted parents and their children from a 5% [[inheritance tax]], and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay [[interest]] of 5% to their municipality to support the children of needy families; alimentary schemes which were later expanded by [[Trajan]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ashley-alimenta&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Ashley |first = Alice M. |title = The 'Alimenta' of Nerva and His Successors |journal = The English Historical Review |volume = 36 |issue = 141 |pages = 5–16 |year = 1921 |url = |accessdate = |doi = 10.1093/ehr/XXXVI.CXLI.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-65&quot;/&gt; Namely, he probably abolished the ''[[Fiscus Judaicus|Fiscus Iudaicus]]'', the additional tax which all [[Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews throughout the Empire]] had to pay: some of his coins bear the legend &lt;small&gt;FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA&lt;/small&gt; (''abolition of [[malicious prosecution]] regarding the Jewish tax'').

Before long, Nerva's expenses strained the economy of Rome and, although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Sutherland |first = C.H.V. |title = The State of the Imperial Treasury at the Death of Domitian |journal = The Journal of Roman Studies |volume = 25 |pages = 150–162 |year = 1935 |accessdate = 2007-09-22 |doi = 10.2307/296596 |publisher = Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |jstor=296596}}&lt;/ref&gt; necessitated the formation of a special [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] of economy to drastically reduce expenditures.&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-61&quot;&gt;Syme (1930), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The most superfluous religious sacrifices, [[gladiator|games]] and [[horse racing|horse races]] were abolished, while new income was generated from Domitian's former possessions, including the auctioning of ships, estates, and even furniture.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-2&quot;/&gt; Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitian's [[silver]] and [[gold]] statues, and Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-1&quot;/&gt;

Because he reigned only briefly, Nerva's public works were few, instead completing projects which had been initiated under Flavian rule. This included extensive repairs to the [[Roman road]] system and the expansion of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1930), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The latter program was headed by the former [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], who helped to put an end to  abuses and later published a significant work on Rome's water supply, [[De aquaeductu|''De Aquis Urbis Romae'']].&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1930), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The only major landmarks constructed under Nerva were a [[granary]], known as the ''Horrea Nervae'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Samuel Ball |last = Platner |author-link = Samuel Ball Platner |editor-last = Ashby |editor-first = Thomas |title = A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |year = 1929 |pages = 260–263 |place = London |publisher = Oxford University Press |url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/horrea.html#Caesaris |accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small [[Imperial forums#Forum of Nerva, or the Transitional Forum|Imperial Forum]] begun by Domitian, which linked the [[Forum of Augustus]] to the [[Imperial forums#Temple of Peace|Temple of Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Little remains, partly because the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]] cuts across it.

Despite Nerva's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the [[Roman army|army]], which had called for his [[apotheosis|deification]] immediately after the assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-domitian-23&quot;/&gt; In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], Nerva had dismissed their prefect [[Titus Petronius Secundus]]—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-casperius-aelianus&quot;&gt;{{ cite web |last = Lendering |first = Jona |title = Casperius Aelianus |url = http://www.livius.org/cao-caz/casperius/aelianus.html |publisher = [http://www.livius.org livius.org] |year = 2005 |accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the generous ''donativum'' bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-7&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.

While the swift transfer of power following Domitian's death had prevented a [[civil war]] from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, but at the same time allowed the prosecution of [[Delator|informers]] by the Senate to continue. This measure led to [[wikt:chaos|chaos]], as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul [[Fronto]] to famously remark that Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-1&quot;/&gt; Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-6&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crassus was exiled to [[Taranto|Tarentum]] and later executed under emperor Hadrian.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor, made more pressing because of Nerva's old age and sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio describes Nerva as having to vomit up his food, see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#1.3 Dio, LXVIII.1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the [[Roman governor|governors]] or [[General Officer|generals]] in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopt]] Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-pliny-nerva&quot;&gt;{{ cite web |last = Lendering |first = Jona |title = Pliny, Nerva and Trajan |url = http://www.livius.org/pi-pm/pliny/pliny_y2.html#trajan |publisher = [http://www.livius.org livius.org] |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander [[Trajan|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the [[Limes Germanicus|German frontier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-pliny-nerva&quot;/&gt;

In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-3&quot;/&gt; He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-8&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.8]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-3&quot;/&gt;

He realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-casperius-aelianus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-62&quot;&gt;Syme (1930), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, he announced the adoption of [[Trajan]] as his successor,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-3&quot;/&gt; and with this decision all but [[abdication|abdicated]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Panygericus'' 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Syme |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Syme |title = Guard Prefects of Trajan and Hadrian |format = subscription required |journal = The Journal of Roman Studies |volume = 70 |pages = 64 |year = 1980 |accessdate = 2007-09-23 |doi = 10.2307/299556 |publisher = Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |jstor=299556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the consulship with Nerva in 98:

{{cquote|Thus Trajan became Caesar and later emperor, although there were relatives of Nerva living. But Nerva did not esteem family relationship above the safety of the State, nor was he less inclined to adopt Trajan because the latter was a Spaniard instead of an Italian or Italot, inasmuch as no foreigner had previously held the Roman sovereignty; for he believed in looking at a man's ability rather than at his nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-4&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#4 LXVIII.4]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contrary to the view here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-62&quot;/&gt; The only candidate with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan.&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-casperius-aelianus&quot;/&gt; Likewise, [[Edward Gibbon]]'s assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]] has found little support among modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Geer |first = Russell Mortimer |title = Second Thoughts on the Imperial Succession from Nerva to Commodus |format = subscription required |journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume = 67 |pages = 47–54 |year = 1936 |doi = 10.2307/283226 |publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=283226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Trajan Divi Nerva.jpg|thumb|300px|Roman [[aureus]] struck under Trajan, ''c.'' 115. The reverse commemorates both Trajan's natural father, [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senator)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]] (right) and his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoptive]] father, the Deified Nerva (left).]]
On 1 January, 98, at the start of his fourth consulship, Nerva suffered a [[stroke]] during a private audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-10&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.10]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust, on 28 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerome-chronicle-275&quot;&gt;Jerome, ''Chronicle'', Romans, p275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-11&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.11]&lt;/ref&gt; He was deified by the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;jerome-chronicle-275&quot;/&gt; and his ashes were laid to rest in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;victor-caesaribus-12-12&quot;&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 12.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerva was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan, who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to [[Pliny the Younger]], Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Panegyricus'' 11.1&lt;/ref&gt; yet no trace of it has ever been found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the [[Praetorian prefect|Guard prefect]] responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#5 LXVIII.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of written sources on this period, much of Nerva's life has remained obscure. The most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian [[Cassius Dio]]. His ''Roman History'', which spans nearly a [[millennium]], from the arrival of [[Aeneas]] in Italy until the year 229, was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from the ''Epitome de Caesaribus'', a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian [[Aurelius Victor]].

A more comprehensive text, presumed to describe the life of Nerva in closer detail, is the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', by the contemporary historian [[Tacitus]]. The ''Histories'' is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor [[Nero]] in 69 until the death of Domitian in 96. Unfortunately, a substantial part of the work has been lost, with only the first five books covering the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] remaining. In the introduction to his biography of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] however, Tacitus speaks highly of Nerva, describing his reign as &quot;the dawn of a most happy age, [when] Nerva Caesar blended things once irreconcilable, sovereignty and freedom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[wikisource:Agricola#3|3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving histories speak equally positively of Nerva's brief reign, although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies. Both Cassius Dio and Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and moderation,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor (attrib.), ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 11.15]&lt;/ref&gt; with Dio commending his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxviii-4&quot;/&gt; These views were later popularized by the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] in his ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. Gibbon considered Nerva the first of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]], five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire &quot;was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue&quot; from 96 until 180. Nevertheless, even Gibbon notes that, compared to his successors, Nerva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign:

{{cquote|Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from the assassins of Domitian before he discovered that his feeble age was unable to stem the torrent of public disorders which had multiplied under the long tyranny of his predecessor. His mild disposition was respected by the good; but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous character, whose justice should strike terror into the guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gibbon |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Gibbon |editor= John Bagnell Bury |title= The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. 1 |origyear= 1776 |url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1365&amp;chapter=50991&amp;layout=html |accessdate= 2007-08-13 |edition= J.B. Bury |year= 1906 |publisher= Fred de Fau and Co |location= New York |chapter= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Nerva pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|Nerva as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; cast of a sculpture in the [[Capitoline Museums]] ([[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow).]]
Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment, characterizing Nerva as a well-intentioned but weak and ineffectual ruler. The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule, but Nerva's mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;syme-finances-65&quot;/&gt; The mutiny led by Casperius Aelianus was never intended as a [[coup]], but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;lendering-casperius-aelianus&quot;/&gt; The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected, reliable general as his successor. Murison concludes that Nerva's real talents were in fact ill-suited to the emperorship:

{{cquote|Nerva was, it would seem, the ultimate &quot;committee&quot; man. He was not, apparently, a great orator, and one has the impression that he functioned better in small groups, where his generally calm approach to problems will have impressed people. [...] What is well-known today, however, is that, more often than not, if the &quot;super committee man&quot; takes on an important administrative job, the result is quite dreadful. Rome was, indeed, spared catastrophe; but for all that near-contemporary writers were &quot;careful&quot; about what they said, Nerva's administration was fairly inept. It would not be unfair to say that he was a textbook illustration of what nowadays is called the &quot;[[Peter Principle]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Murison, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary, if tumultuous stop-gap before the Trajanic-Antonine dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-195&quot;/&gt; It is a fact of [[irony]] that even the only major public work completed during his reign, the Forum of Nerva, ultimately became known as the ''Forum Transitorium'', or transitional forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Samuel Ball |last = Platner |author-link = Samuel Ball Platner |editor-last = Ashby |editor-first = Thomas |title = A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome: Forum Nervae |year = 1929 |pages = 227–229 |place = London |publisher = Oxford University Press |url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Forum_Nervae.html |accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nervo-Trajanic Dynasty}}

'''Trajan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|eɪ|dʒ|ən|}}; {{lang-la|Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Divi Nervae filius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;Trajan's regal name had an equivalent English meaning of &quot;Commander Caesar Nerva Trajan, son of the Divine Nerva, the Emperor&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; September 18, 53 – August 8, 117 AD) was [[Roman emperor]] from 98 AD until his death in 117 AD. Officially declared by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] ''optimus princeps'' (&quot;the best ruler&quot;), Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in [[Roman history]], leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death. He is also known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public [[Trajan#Building activities|building programs]] and implementing [[Alimenta|social welfare policies]], which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]] who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the [[Mediterranean world]].

Born in the city of [[Italica]] in the province of [[Hispania Baetica]], Trajan's non-patrician family was of Italian and perhaps Iberian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps, 2nd Edition, Routledge 2000, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor [[Domitian]]. Serving as a [[legatus legionis]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the [[Rhine]] led by [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus|Antonius Saturninus]].&lt;ref&gt;Benett, Julian (1997). ''Trajan. Optimus Princeps''. Routledge, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, culminating in a revolt by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], Nerva was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. He died on 27 January 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident.

As a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program, which reshaped the city of [[Rome]] and left numerous enduring landmarks such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. Early in his reign, he annexed the [[Nabataean kingdom]], creating the province of [[Arabia Petraea]]. His conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] enriched the empire greatly, as the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. However, its exposed position north of the Danube made it susceptible to attack on three sides, and it was later abandoned by Emperor [[Aurelian]].

Trajan's war against the [[Parthian Empire]] ended with the sack of the capital [[Ctesiphon]] and the annexation of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a [[stroke]] in the city of [[Gazipaşa|Selinus]]. He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the Senate and his ashes were laid to rest under Trajan's Column. He was succeeded by his adopted son [[Hadrian]].

==Sources==
As an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured&amp;nbsp;– he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honored by the Senate with the wish ''[[felicior Augusto, melior Traiano]]'' (that he be &quot;luckier than [[Augustus]] and better than Trajan&quot;). Among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a [[virtuous pagan]], while the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] popularized the notion of the [[Five Good Emperors]], of whom Trajan was the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Idiots guide to the Roman Empire|last=Nelson|first=Eric|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn= 0-02-864151-5|pages=207–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as far as literary sources are concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. Book&amp;nbsp;68 in [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'', which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgments and epitomes, is the best source for the political history of Trajan's rule. Besides this, [[Pliny the Younger]]'s ''Panegyricus'' and [[Dio of Prusa]]'s orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory perorations, typical of the late Roman era, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', xii/xiii and 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Tenth Volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of Imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an exchange of official mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile.&lt;ref&gt;Finley Hooper, ''Roman Realities''. Wayne State University Press, 1979, ISBN 0-8143-1594-1 , page 427&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation, as well as recourse to non-literary sources such as archaeology and epigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and rise to power==
[[File:Trajan2.jpg|thumb|Denarius of Trajan, minted in Rome in 101–102 AD]]
Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born on 18&amp;nbsp;September 53&amp;nbsp;AD in the Roman province of [[Hispania Baetica]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Syme, Tacitus, 30–44; PIR Vlpivs 575&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[Andalusia]] in modern Spain), in the city of [[Italica]] (now in the municipal area of Santiponce, in the outskirts of [[Seville]]). Although frequently designated the first provincial emperor, and dismissed by later writers like [[Cassius Dio]] &quot;an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot&quot;, Trajan appears to have hailed, at least on his father's side, from the area of Tuder (modern [[Todi]]) in in northern [[Umbria]]. Trajan's birthplace of Italica was founded as a Roman military colony in 206 BC, although it is unknown when the Ulpii arrived there. It is possible, but cannot be substantiated, that Trajan's ancestors married local women and lost their citizenship at some point, but they certainly recovered their status when the city became a [[municipium]] with [[Latin citizenship]] in the mid-1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Blumberg, ''Great Leaders, Great Tyrants? Contemporary Views of World Rulers who Made History'', 1995, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.315: &quot;Trajan is frequently but misleadingly designated the first provincial emperor, because the Ulpii were from Baetica (southern Spain). The family, resident in Spain for some time, originated in Italian Tuder, not far from the Flavian home of Reate. The emperor's father, M. Ulpius Traianus, was an early adherent of Vespasian and perhaps the old family friend. This Trajan evidently married a Marcia (her name is inferred from that of their daughter Marciana) whose family owned brickyards in the vicinity of Ameria, near both Reate and Tuder. She was possibly an older sister of Marcia Furnilla, second wife of Vespasian's son Titus. Further, Ulpia, sister of the senior Trajan, was a grandmother of Hadrian. In other words, the emperor Trajan was succeeded in 117 by his cousin, member of another Italian family resident in Baetica.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan was the son of [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]] and [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senior)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], a prominent [[Roman Senate|senator]] and general from the ''[[Ulpia (gens)|gens Ulpia]]''. Marcus Ulpius Traianus the elder served Vespasian in the first Jewish war, commanding the X&amp;nbsp;''Fretensis'' legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=In the name of Rome: The men who won the Roman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan himself was just one of many well-known Ulpii in a line that continued long after his own death. His elder sister was [[Ulpia Marciana]], and his niece was [[Salonina Matidia]]. The ''[[Homeland|patria]]'' of the Ulpii was [[Italica]], in Spanish Baetica,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; where their ancestors had settled late in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BC.

As a young man, he rose through the ranks of the [[Roman army]], serving in some of the most contentious parts of the Empire's frontier. In 76–77, Trajan's father was [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] (''[[Legatus]] pro praetore Syriae''), where Trajan himself remained as ''[[Tribunus]] legionis''. From there, after his father's replacement, he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province, and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Bennett, ''Trajan: Optimus Princeps''. Bloomington: Indiana U. Press, 2001, ISBN 0-253-21435-1 , pages 22/23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 86, Trajan's cousin [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer|P.&amp;nbsp;Aelius Afer]] died, leaving his young children [[Hadrian]] and [[Paulina#Sister of Hadrian|Paulina]] orphans. Trajan and a colleague of his, [[Publius Acilius Attianus]], became co-guardians of the two children, raising them in their respective households.

Around 91, Trajan was nominated as [[Consul]], and he brought [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] with him to [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2.5–6&quot;&gt;Augustan History, ''Life of Hadrian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2.5 2.5–6].&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he married [[Pompeia Plotina]], a noble woman from the settlement at [[Nîmes]]; the marriage ultimately remained childless. It is not clear that Trajan was actively predisposed towards [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|homosexuality]], as [[bisexual]] activity was common among Roman men of the period, and so his homosexual activities could be interpreted as nothing more than a functional aspect of his class. Nevertheless, [[Cassius Dio]] makes reference to them, and Trajan's putative lovers included [[Hadrian]] and the pages of the imperial household, the actor Pylades, a dancer called Apolaustus, and possibly Licinius Sura and [[Nerva]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

As the details of Trajan's military career are obscure, it is only sure that in 89, as legate of [[Legio VII Gemina]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported Domitian against an attempted ''coup''.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he held some unspecified consular commission as governor on either [[Pannonia]] or [[Germania Superior]] &amp;ndash; possibly both. Pliny attributes to him, at the time, various (and uspecified) feats of arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett 45 46&quot;&gt;Bennett, 45/46&lt;/ref&gt;

As Domitian's successor, [[Nerva]] was unpopular with the army and had just been forced by his Praetorian Prefect [[Casperius Aelianus]] to execute Domitian's killers,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Alston, ''Aspects of Roman History 31BC-AD117''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-61120-6 , page 261&lt;/ref&gt; he felt the need to do something in order to avoid ousting by gaining the support of the military. He accomplished this in the summer of 97 by naming Trajan as his adoptive son and successor, allegedly solely on Trajan's outstanding military merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett 45 46&quot;/&gt; There are hints, however, in contemporary literary sources that Trajan's adoption was imposed on Nerva. Pliny implied as much when he wrote that, although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something, if this were the way in which Trajan was raised to power, then it was worth it. If this was what actually occurred, Trajan would be a usurper, and the notion of a natural continuity between Nerva's and Trajan's reigns would be an ''ex post'' fiction developed later by historians such as [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason König,Tim Whitmarsh, eds., ''Ordering Knowledge in the Roman Empire''. Cambridge University Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-521-85969-1 , page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Augustan History]]'', it was the future Emperor [[Hadrian]] who brought word to Trajan of his adoption.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.5–6&quot;/&gt; Hadrian was then retained on the Rhine frontier by Trajan as a military tribune, becoming privy to the circle of friends and relations with which Trajan hedged himself&amp;nbsp;– among them the then governor of [[Germania Inferior]], the Spaniard [[Lucius Licinius Sura]], who would become Trajan's chief personal adviser and official friend.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Grainger, ''Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96–99''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-34958-3 , pages 91 and 109&lt;/ref&gt; As a token of his influence, Sura would later become consul for the third time in 107; some ancient sources also tell about his having built a bath named after him on the [[Aventine Hill]], or having this bath built by Trajan and then named after him; in either case, a signal honor, the only exception to the established rule that a public building in the Roman Empire could be dedicated only to a member of the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World''. University of Michigan Press, 2002, ISBN 0-472-08865-3 , pages 113/114; [[Paul Veyne]], ''Le Pain et le Cirque'', Paris: Seuil, ISBN 2-02-004507-9, page 686, note 399&lt;/ref&gt; These baths were later expanded by the third century emperor [[Decius]] as a means of stressing his purported identity with Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City''. Baltimore: JHU Press,2010,ISBN 978-0-8018-9253-0, page 338&lt;/ref&gt; Sura is also described as telling Hadrian in 108 about his selection as imperial heir.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Levick, ''Faustina I and II: Imperial Women of the Golden Age''.Oxford University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-19-537941-9 , page 42&lt;/ref&gt; According to a modern historian, Sura's role as kingmaker and éminence grise was deeply resented by some senators, especially the historian Tacitus, who acknowledged Sura's military and oratory virtues but at the same time resented his rapacity and devious ways, similar to those of [[Vespasian]]'s éminence grise [[Licinius Mucianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Cizek, &quot;Tacite face à Trajan&quot;, available at [http://publicacions.iec.cat/repository/pdf/00000114%5C00000035.pdf], pages 127/128. Retrieved July 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nerva died on 27&amp;nbsp;January 98, Trajan succeeded to the role of emperor without any outward incident. However, the fact that he chose not to hasten towards Rome, but instead to make a lengthy tour of inspection on the Rhine and Danube frontiers, hints to the possible fact that his power position in Rome was unsure and that he first had to assure himself of the loyalty of the armies at the front. It is noteworthy that Trajan ordered Prefect Aelianus to attend him in Germany, where he was apparently executed (&quot;put out of the way&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, 111&lt;/ref&gt; with his post being taken by [[Attius Suburanus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's accession, therefore, would qualify more as a successful ''coup'' than an orderly succession.&lt;ref&gt;Alston, 262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Emperor==
[[File:Büste des Kaisers Trajan.JPG|thumb|Bust of Trajan in 108&amp;nbsp;AD, in the [[Museum of Art History]] in Vienna, Austria]]
On his entry at Rome, Trajan granted the plebs a direct gift of money. The traditional [[Donativum|donative]] to the troops, however, was reduced by half.&lt;ref&gt;Alston, 200 and 206&lt;/ref&gt; There remained the issue of the strained relations between the emperor and the Senate, especially after the supposed bloodiness that had marked Domitian's reign and his dealings with the Curia. By playing on a motif of feigned reluctance to hold power, Trajan was able to start building a consensus around him in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, ed. , ''Latin Panegyric''. Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-957671-5 , page 198&lt;/ref&gt; His belated ceremonial entry into Rome in 99 was notably low-key, something on which Pliny the Younger elaborated.&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Jones,Keith C. Sidwell, eds., ''The World of Rome: An Introduction to Roman Culture''. Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-38421-4 , page 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;page 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, by not openly supporting Domitian's preference for equestrian officers,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jones, ''The Emperor Domitian''. London, Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-203-03625-5&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan appeared as conforming to the idea (developed by Pliny) that an emperor derived his legitimacy from his adherence to traditional senatorial morals and traditional hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia Serghidou, ''Fear of slaves, fear of enslavement in the ancient Mediterranean''. Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 2007, ISBN 978-2-84867-169-7, page 314&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he could point to the allegedly republican character of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Wilkinson, ''Republicanism during the Early Roman Empire''. New York: Continuum, 2012, ISBN 978-1-4411-2052-6, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; In the inaugural for his third consulship, on 1&amp;nbsp;January 100, Trajan would exhort the Senate to share with him the caretaking of the Empire&amp;nbsp;– an event later celebrated on a coin.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 121; Veyne, ''L&quot;Empire Gréco-Romain'',Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4 ,page 402&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan did not share power in any meaningful way with the Senate, something that Pliny admits candidly: &quot;everything depends on the whims of a single man who, in behalf of the common welfare, has taken upon himself all functions and all tasks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'' III, 20, 12, quoted by Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 38, footnote 108.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most salient traits of his reign was his encroachment on the Senate's sphere of authority, as when he made the senatorial provinces of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Bythinia]] into imperial ones in order to deal with the inordinate spending on public works by local magnates,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kuiper, ed., ''Ancient Rome: From Romulus and Remus to the Visigoth Invasion''. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, ISBN 978-1-61530-207-9 , page 128&lt;/ref&gt; and with general mismanagement of provincial affairs by various [[proconsul]]s appointed by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Gsell, &quot;Étude sur le rôle politique du Sénat Romain à l'époque de Trajan&quot; , ''Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire'', 1887, V.7.7, available at [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-4874_1887_num_7_1_6514]. Accessed January 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the formula developed by Pliny, Trajan was a &quot;good&quot; emperor in that, by himself, he approved or blamed the same things the Senate would have approved or blamed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; If in reality Trajan was an autocrat, his deferential behavior towards his peers qualified him to the role of virtuous monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan K. Balot, ed., ''A Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought''.John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012,&lt;/ref&gt; The whole idea was that Trajan wielded autocratic power through ''moderatio'' instead of ''contumacia''&amp;nbsp;– moderation instead of insolence.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, ed., ''Latin Panegyric'', Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-957671-5 , page 137&lt;/ref&gt; In short, according to the ethics for autocracy developed by most political writers of the Imperial Roman Age, Trajan was a good ruler in that he ruled less by fear, and mostly by means of acting as a role model, for, according to Pliny, &quot;men learn better from examples&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos F. Noreña, &quot;The Ethics of Autocracy in the Roman World&quot;. IN Ryan K. Balot, ed., ''A COMPANION TO GREEK AND ROMAN POLITICAL THOUGHT''. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2009, ISBN 978-1-4051-5143-6 , page 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Trajan's popularity among his peers was such that the [[Roman Senate]] bestowed upon him the [[honorific]] of ''optimus'', meaning &quot;the best&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard W. Henderson, &quot;Five Roman Emperors&quot; (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Lepper, &quot;Trajan's Parthian War&quot; (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; which appears on coins since 105.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Togo Salmon,''A History of the Roman World from 30 B.C. to A.D. 138''. London: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-04504-5 , page 274&lt;/ref&gt; This title had to do mostly with Trajan's role as benefactor, as in the case of his returning confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Forbis, ''Municipal Virtues in the Roman Empire: The Evidence of Italian Honorary Inscriptions''.Stuttgart: Teubner, 1996, ISBN 3-519-07628-4, pages 23/24&lt;/ref&gt;

That Trajan's ideal role was a conservative one becomes evident from Pliny's works as well as from the orations of Dio of Prusa&amp;nbsp;– mostly his four ''Orations on Kingship'', composed early during Trajan's reign. Dio, as a Greek notable and intellectual with friends in high places, and possibly an official friend to the emperor (''amicus caesaris'')&amp;nbsp;– saw Trajan as a defender of the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Fuhrmann, ''Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order''.Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-973784-0 , page 175; Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 241&lt;/ref&gt; In his third kingship oration, Dio describes an ideal king ruling by means of &quot;friendship&quot;&amp;nbsp;– that is, through patronage and a network of local notables who act as mediators between the ruled and the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Rice, ''Paul and Patronage: The Dynamics of Power in 1 Corinthians''. Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2013, ISBN 978-1-62032-557-5 , pages 84 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Correctores'': Greek/Roman relations===

As a senatorial Emperor, Trajan was inclined to choose his local basis of political support among the members of the ruling urban oligarchies. In the West, that meant local senatorial families like his own. In the East, that meant the Greek notables' families. The Greeks, however, had their own memories of independence&amp;nbsp;– as well as their commonly acknowledged cultural superiority&amp;nbsp;– and disdained Roman rule instead of seeing themselves as Roman as did their Western counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 195/196&lt;/ref&gt; What the Greek oligarchies wanted from Rome was, above all, to be left in peace and to be allowed to concentrate on their local interests&amp;nbsp;– something the Romans were not inclined to do, as they felt the Greeks were shunning their responsibilities in the management of Imperial affairs.

An outstanding example of this Greek alienation was the personal role played by Dio of Prusa in his relationship with Trajan. As a Greek local magnate with a taste for costly building projects, and pretensions of being an important political agent for Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Goldhill, ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire''. Cambridge University Press, 2007, ISBN 0-521-66317-2 , page 293&lt;/ref&gt; Dio of Prusa was a target for one of Trajan's authoritarian innovations: the setting of imperial [[corrector|''correctores'']] to audit the civic finances&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hudson McLean, ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods from Alexander the Great Down to the Reign of Constantine (323 B.C.-A.D. 337''.

London: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-203-48218-2 , page 138&lt;/ref&gt; This had to do mostly with curbing overenthusiastic spending on public works as a means of channeling ancient rivalries between neighboring cities.

Competition between Greek cities and their ruling oligarchies had to do mostly with marks of preeminence, specially for titles bestowed by the Roman emperor. Such titles were ordered into a ranking system which determined how the cities were to be treated by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, ed. ''A Companion to the Roman Empire''. Malden, MA: Wiley, 2010, ISBN 978-0-631-22644-4, page 246&lt;/ref&gt; The usual form that such rivalries took was that of grandiose building plans, giving the cities the opportunity to vie with each over &quot;extravagant, needless&amp;nbsp;... structures that would make a show&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Macmullen, ''Enemies of the Roman Order''. London, Routledge, 1992, ISBN 0-415-08621-3 , page 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Such extravagant spending had as side effect that junior and thus less wealthy members of the local oligarchies felt disinclined to present themselves to fill posts as local magistrates, such positions involving ever increasing personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Anderson, ''Second Sophistic: A Cultural Phenomenon in the Roman Empire''.

As much as Roman authorities liked to play the Greek cities against one another,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 246&lt;/ref&gt; they also had an interest in assuring their solvency and therefore ready collection of Imperial taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard Temporini,Wolfgang Haase, eds., ''Politische Geschichte: Provinzen und Randvoelker – Griescher Balkanraum: Kleinasien''. Berlin; de Gruyter, 1980, ISBN 3-11-008015-X , pages 668/669&lt;/ref&gt; However, inordinate spending on civic buildings was also a means for the local Greek elites to maintain a separate cultural identity&amp;nbsp;– something expressed in the contemporary rise of the [[Second Sophistic]]; this &quot;cultural patriotism&quot; acted as a kind of substitute for the loss of political independence,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, &quot;L'identité grecque devant Rome et l'empereur&quot;, ''Revue des Études Grecques'', 1999, V.122-2, page  515.

The first known ''corrector'' was charged with a commission &quot;to deal with the situation of the free cities&quot;, as it was felt that the old method of ''ad hoc'' intervention by the Emperor and/or the proconsuls had not been enough to curb the pretensions of the Greek notables.&lt;ref&gt;JC Carrière ,&quot;À propos de ''la Politique'' de Plutarque &quot; – ''Dialogues d'histoire ancienne'', V.3, no.3, 1977.

Oxford University Press, 2002, ISBN 0-19-925521-0, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pliny, the best way to achieve this was to lower the minimum age for holding a seat on the council, making it possible for more sons of the established oligarchical families to join and thus contribute to civic spending; this was seen as preferable to enrolling non-noble wealthy upstarts.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Concern about independent local political activity is seen in Trajan's decision to forbid [[Nicomedia]] from having a corps of firemen (&quot;If people assemble for a common purpose&amp;nbsp;... they soon turn it into a political society&quot;, Trajan wrote Pliny) as well as in his and Pliny's fears about excessive civic generosities by local notables such as distribution of money and/or gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, 487; Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''.

===Conquest of Dacia===
{{main|Trajan's Dacian Wars}}
It was as a military commander that Trajan is best known to history, particularly for his conquests in the [[Near East]], but initially for the two wars against [[Dacia]]&amp;nbsp;– the reduction to [[satellite state|client kingdom]] (101–102), followed by actual incorporation into the Empire of the trans-Danube border group of Dacia&amp;nbsp;– an area that had troubled Roman thought for over a decade with the unfavourable (and to some, shameful) peace negotiated by [[Domitian]]'s ministers with the powerful Dacian king [[Decebalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanis REquote01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-07-21|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/assobd.htm#t-inx|title=De Imperatoribus Romanis|work=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|quote= Battle of Sarmizegetusa (Sarmizegetuza), A.D. 105. During Trajan's reign one of the most important Roman successes was the victory over the Dacians. The first important confrontation between the Romans and the [[Dacians]] had taken place in the year 87 and was initiated by Domitian. The [[praetorian prefect]] Cornelius Fuscus led five or six legions across the Danube on a bridge of ships and advanced towards [[Banat]] (in [[Romania]]). The Romans were surprised by a Dacian attack at Tapae (near the village of [[Bucova]], in Romania). [[Legion V Alaude]] was crushed and Cornelius Fuscus was killed. The victorious [[Dacia]]n general was called [[Decebalus]] (the brave one).}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the provisions of this treaty, Decebalus was acknowledged as ''rex amicus'', that is, client king; nevertheless, in exchange for accepting client status, he received a generous stipend from Rome, as well as being supplied with technical experts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schmitz, ''The Dacian Threat, 101–106 AD''.

Trajan imposed on the Dacians very hard peace conditions: [[Decebalus]] had to renounce claim to some regions of his kingdom, including Banat, Tara Hategului, Oltenia, and Muntenia in the area south-west of Transylvania. He had also to surrender all the Roman deserters and all his war machines. At Rome, Trajan was received as a winner and he took the name of Dacicus, a title that appears on his coinage of this period. At the beginning of the year 103 A.D., there were minted coins with the inscription: IMP NERVA TRAIANVS AVG GER DACICVS.

During the following winter, King [[Decebalus]] took the initiative by launching a counter-attack across the [[Danube]] further downstream, supported by Sarmatian cavalry,&lt;ref&gt;José Maria Blázquez,  ''Las res gestae de Trajano militar: las guerras dácicas''. ''Aquila Legionis'', 6 (2005) 19&lt;/ref&gt; forcing Trajan to come to the aid of the troops in his rearguard. The Dacian invasion was repulsed after two battles in Moesia: in [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] and [[Adamclisi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Glodariu, ''LA ZONE DE SARMIZEGETUSA REGIA ET LES GUERRES DE TRAJAN''.

Decebalus had to renounce claim to some regions of his kingdom, return all Roman runaways (most of them technical experts), and surrender all his war machines.

Trajan returned to Rome in triumph and was granted the title ''Dacicus Maximus''. The victory was celebrated by the [[Tropaeum Traiani]].

Although the peace of 102 had restored him to the condition of more or less harmless client king, Decebalus, after being left to his own devices, began to rearm, to harbor Roman runaways anew, as well as to pressure his Western neighbors, the [[Iazyges]] Sarmatians, into allying themselves to him. In 104, he devised a failed attempt on Trajan's life by mean of some Roman deserters, and held prisoner Trajan's legate Longinus&amp;nbsp;– who eventually poisoned himself while in custody. Finally, in 105, Decebalus undertook an invasion of Roman-occupied territory north of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dando-Collins, ''Legions of Rome: The definitive history of every Roman legion''.

Prior to the campaign, Trajan had already raised two entirely new legions: [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|II Traiana]]&amp;nbsp;– which, however, may have been posted in the East, at the Syrian port of [[Laodicea ad Mare|Laodicea]]&amp;nbsp;– and [[XXX Ulpia Victrix]], which was posted to [[Brigetio]], in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the absence of literary references, however, the positioning of the new legions is conjectural: some scholars think that Legio II Traiana Fortis was originally stationed on the Lower Danube and participated in the Second Dacian War, being only later deployed to the East:cf.

Mattern, ''Rome and the Enemy: Imperial Strategy in the Principate''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999, ISBN 0-520-21166-9 , page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Also, following the design of [[Apollodorus of Damascus]], he ordered the building of a [[Trajan's Bridge|massive bridge over the Danube]], over which the Roman army was able to cross the Danube swiftly and in numbers, as well as to send in reinforcements, even in winter when the river was not frozen enough to bear the passage of a party of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;N. J. E. Austin &amp; N. B. Rankov , ''Exploratio: Military &amp; Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople''. London: Routledge,  2002, page  177&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan also reformed the infrastructure of the [[Iron Gates]] region of the [[Danube]]. He commissioned either the creation or enlargement of the road along the Iron Gates carved into the side of the gorge.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, James 1997 &quot;Beyond the Danube's Iron Gates.&quot; ''Archaeology'' 50(2): 24–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Trajan commissioned a canal to be built around the rapids of the Iron Gates. Evidence of this comes from a marble slab discovered near [[Caput Bovis]], the site of a Roman fort. The slab, dated to the year 101, commemorates the building of at least one canal that went from the Kasajna tributary to at least Ducis Pratum, whose embankments were still visible until recently. However, the placement of the slab at Caput Bovis suggests that the canal extended to this point or that there was a second canal downriver of the Kasajna-Ducis Pratum one.&lt;ref&gt;Šašel, Jaroslav. 1973  &quot;Trajan's Canal at the Iron Gate.&quot; ''The Journal of Roman Studies''. 63:80–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oltean, ''Dacia: Landscape, Colonization and Romanization''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0-203-94583-2 , page 222&lt;/ref&gt; there is no extant evidence for the existence in the province of [[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrine]] cities. Native Dacians continued to live in scattered rural settlements, according to their own ways.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux, 268&lt;/ref&gt; The main effort of urbanization was concentrated by Trajan at the rearguard, in Moesia, where he created the new cities of Nicopolis ad Istrum and [[Marcianopolis]]. A [[vicus]] was also created around the Tropaeum Traianum.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Sartre, ''El Oriente romano, Parte 3''. Madrid: AKAL, 1994, ISBN 84-460-0412-7, page 269&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison city of [[Oescus]] received the status of [[Roman colony]] after its legionary garrison was redeployed.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of Dacia was permanently occupied. The Roman province eventually took the form of a gigantic spearhead stretching from the Danube northwards to the [[Carpathians]], and was intended perhaps as a basis for further expansion in Eastern Europe&amp;nbsp;– which the Romans conceived to be much more &quot;flattened&quot;, and closer to the ocean, than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, 61&lt;/ref&gt; Defense of the province was entrusted to a single legion, the [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII Gemina]], stationed at [[Alba Julia|Apulum]], which functioned as an advanced guard that could, in case of need, strike either west or east at the Sarmatians living at the borders.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, 101 and 104&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the indefensible character of the province did not appear to be a problem for Trajan, as the province was conceived more as a sally-base for further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Vermeulen,Kathy Sas,Wouter Dhaeze, eds.

Trajan resettled Dacia with Romans and annexed it as a province of the Roman Empire. Aside from their enormous booty (over half a million slaves, according to [[John Lydus]]),&lt;ref&gt;Moses I. Finley, ed., ''Classical Slavery'', London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 0-7146-3320-8 , page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's Dacian campaigns benefited the Empire's finances through the acquisition of Dacia's gold mines, managed by an imperial [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] rank (''procurator aurariarum'').&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux, 241&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural exploitation on the [[Roman villa|villa]] model, on the contrary, was poorly developed.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, slave labor in the province itself seems to have been relatively undeveloped, and epigraphic evidence points to work in the gold mines being conducted by means of labor contracts (''locatio conductio rei'') and seasonal wage-earning.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Epstein, ''Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe''. UNC Press, 1991, ISBN 0-8078-1939-5 , page 26; Paul du Plessis, ''Studying Roman Law''. Bllomsbury Publishing, 2014, page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory was commemorated by the construction of [[Trajan's Column]], which depicts in stone carved bas-reliefs the Dacian Wars' most important moments.

===Annexation of Nabataea===
At about the same time, [[Rabbel II Soter]], one of Rome's client kings, died. This event might have prompted the annexation of the [[Nabataean kingdom]], but the manner and the formal reasons for the annexation are unclear. Some epigraphic evidence suggests a military operation, with forces from [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]. What is known is that by 107, Roman legions were stationed in the area around [[Petra]] and [[Bostra]], as is shown by a papyrus found in Egypt. The furthest south the Romans occupied (or, better, garrisoned, adopting a policy of having garrisons at key points in the desert)&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Sartre, 46&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Mada'in Saleh|Hegra]], over {{convert|300|km|mi}} south-west of [[Petra]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 177&lt;/ref&gt; The empire gained what became the province of [[Arabia Petraea]] (modern southern [[Jordan]] and north west [[Saudi Arabia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 172–182&lt;/ref&gt; As Nabataea was the last client kingdom in Asia west of the Euphrates, the annexation meant that the entire Roman East had been provincialized, completing a trend towards direct rule that had begun under the Flavians.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next seven years, Trajan ruled as a civilian emperor, to the same acclaim as before. It was during this time that he corresponded with [[Pliny the Younger]] on the subject of how to deal with the [[Christianity|Christians]] of [[Pontus]], telling [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|Pliny]] to continue to persecute Christians but not to accept anonymous denounciations in the interests of justice as well as of &quot;the spirit of the age&quot;. People who admitted to their being Christians and refused to recant, however, were to be executed &quot;for obstinacy&quot; when non-citizens, and sent to Rome for trial if they were Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Benko, ''Pagan Rome and the Early Christians''. Bloomington: Indiana U. Press, 1986, ISBN 0-253-20385-6 , pages 6/7&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan built several new buildings, monuments and roads in [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and his native [[Hispania]]. His magnificent complex in Rome raised to commemorate his victories in [[Dacia]] (and largely financed from that campaign's loot) – consisting of a [[Trajan's Forum|forum]], [[Trajan's Column]], and Trajan's Market still stands in Rome today. He was also [[Arch of Trajan (disambiguation)|a prolific builder of triumphal arches]], many of which survive, and a rebuilder of roads ([[Via Traiana]] and [[Via Traiana Nova]]).

One of Trajan's notable acts during this period was the hosting of a three-month [[gladiator]]ial festival in the great [[Colosseum]] in Rome (the precise date of this festival is unknown). Combining chariot racing, beast fights and close-quarters gladiatorial bloodshed, this gory spectacle reputedly left 11,000 dead (mostly slaves and criminals, not to mention the thousands of ferocious beasts killed alongside them) and attracted a total of five million spectators over the course of the festival. The care bestowed by Trajan on the managing of such public spectacles led the orator [[Fronto]] to state approvingly that Trajan had paid equal attention to entertainments as well as to serious issues. Fronto concluded that &quot;neglect of serious matters can cause greater damage,  but neglect of amusements greater discontent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Andrea Giardina, ed. ''THe Romans''. University of Chicago Press, 1993, ISBN 0-226-29049-2, page 272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devaluation of the currency===
In 107 he devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 93.5% to 89% – the actual silver weight dropping from 3.04&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.88&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |title=Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot; |publisher=Tulane.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This devaluation, coupled with the massive amount of gold and silver carried off after [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]], allowed the emperor to mint a larger quantity of denarii than his predecessors. Also, Trajan withdrew from circulation silver denarii minted before the previous devaluation achieved by Nero, something that allows for thinking that Trajan's devaluation had to do with political ends, such as allowing for increased civil and military spending.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Petit, ''Pax Romana''. Berkeley: U. of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-02171-1 , page 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''alimenta''===

Another important act was his formalisation of the ''[[alimenta]]'', a welfare program that helped orphans and poor children throughout Italy. It provided general funds, as well as food and subsidized education. The program was supported initially by funds from the Dacian War, and then later by a combination of estate taxes and philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tjbuggey.ancients.info/Alimenta.html |title=Alimenta |publisher=Tjbuggey.ancients.info |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the scheme functioned by means of mortgages on Italian farms (''fundi''), through which registered landowners received a lump sum from the imperial treasure, being in return engaged to pay yearly a given proportion of the loan to the maintenance of the alimentary fund.&lt;ref&gt;John Rich,Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, eds., ''City and Country in the Ancient World''. London: Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-203-41870-0, page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the system is well documented in literary sources and contemporary epigraphy, its precise aims are controversial and have generated considerable dispute among modern scholars, especially about its actual aims and scope as a piece of welfare policy. It is usually assumed that the program was intended to bolster citizen numbers in Italy, following the provisions of Augustus' moral legislation (''[[Lex Julia]]'') favoring procreation on moral grounds&amp;nbsp;– something openly acknowledged by Pliny.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Evans Grubbs,Tim Parkin, eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of Childhood and Education in the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-19-978154-6, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as an aim this was in itself anachronistic, in that it saw the Roman Empire as a hegemony centering on a purely Italian manpower base.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne:''Le Pain et le Cirque'', Paris: Seuil, 1976, ISBN 2-02-004507-9 , page 654&lt;/ref&gt; This anachronistic stance is confirmed by Pliny, when he wrote that the recipients of the ''alimenta'' were supposed to people &quot;the barracks and the tribes&quot; as future soldiers and electors&amp;nbsp;– two roles ill-fitted to the contemporary reality of a Mediterranean hegemony ruled by an autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne, ''Le Pain at le Cirque'', Eng. trans., A. Lane, 1990, pg.372&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the scheme was restricted to Italy points to the fact that it might be conceived as a form of political privilege accorded to the heartland of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;José María Blanch Nougués, ''Régimen jurídico de las fundaciones en derecho romano''. Madrid: Dykinson, 2007, ISBN 978-84-9772-985-7 , page  151&lt;/ref&gt; According to the French historian Paul Petit, the ''alimenta'' should be seen as part of a set of measures aimed towards the economic recovery of Italy, such as the stricture laid down by Trajan ordering all senators, even when from the provinces, to have at least a third of their landed estates in Italian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Petit, ''Pax Romana'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-02171-1 , page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, the fact that the scheme was subsidized by means of interest payments on loans made by landowners&amp;nbsp;– and mostly large ones, assumed to be more reliable debtors&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duncan-Jones, ''The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies''. Cambridge University Press: 1982, ISBN 0-521-24970-8 , page 297&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– actually restricted it to a small percentage of potential welfare recipients ([[Paul Veyne]] has assumed that, in the city of [[Veleia (Italy)|Veleia]], only one child out of ten was an actual beneficiary). Therefore, the idea, advanced by [[Moses I. Finley]], that the whole scheme was at most a form of random charity, a mere imperial benevolence&lt;ref&gt;M.I. Finley, Ancient Economy, 201/203&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and that the fact that these charities seem to have been backed by loans to great landowners only (in Veleia, only some 17&amp;nbsp;square kilometers were mortgaged)&lt;ref&gt;Luuk de Ligt,S. J. Northwood, eds., ''People, Land, and Politics: Demographic Developments and the Transformation of Roman Italy 300 BC-AD 14'', Leiden: Brill, 2008, ISBN 978-90-04-17118-3, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; restricted the extent of the scheme further. It seems that the mortgage scheme was simply a way of making local notables participate, albeit in a lesser role, in imperial benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Julián González, ed. ''Trajano Emperador De Roma: Atti Del Congresso. Siviglia 1998, 14–17 Settembre''. Rome : L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, ISBN 88-8265-111-8 , page 297&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the scheme was, to some extent, a forced loan, something that tied unwilling landowners to the imperial fisc in order to make then supply some funds to civic expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Holman, ''The Hungry Are Dying : Beggars and Bishops in Roman Cappadocia''. Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-19-513912-7, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a senator such as Pliny had endowed his city of Comum a perpetual right to an annual charge (''vectigal'') of thirty thousand sestertii on one of his estates, allowing for the maintenance of his, Pliny's, private charitable foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones, 298/299&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the ''alimenta'' scheme was developed during and after the Dacian Wars, and followed two distributions of money to the population of Rome (''congiaria'') during Dacian triumphs, points towards the purely charitable character of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Dixon, ed., ''Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World''. London: Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0-415-23578-2 , page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Parthia===
[[File:Trajan RIC 325 - 650918.jpg|thumb|300px|Aureus issued by Trajan to celebrate the conquest of Parthia.]]
[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan (117).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J. ''Trajan: Optimus Princeps''. 1997. Fig. 1&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 113, Trajan embarked on his last campaign, provoked by [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]'s decision to put an unacceptable king on the throne of [[Armenia]], a kingdom over which the two great empires had shared [[hegemony]] since the time of [[Nero]] some fifty years earlier.

As the surviving literary accounts of Trajan's Parthian War are fragmentary and scattered,&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Longden, &quot;Notes on the Parthian Campaigns of Trajan&quot;. The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 21 (1931), pp. 1–35. Available at [http://rbedrosian.com/Rome/Longden_1931_Trajan_Parthians.pdf]. Retrieved November 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to assign them a proper context, something that has led to a long-running controversy about its precise happenings and ultimate aims. Many modern historians consider that Trajan's decision to wage war against Parthia might have had economic motives: after Trajan's annexation of Arabia, he built a new road, [[Via Traiana Nova]], that went from [[Bosra|Bostra]] to [[Aqaba|Aila]] on the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Steven E. Sidebotham, ''Roman Economic Policy in the Erythra Thalassa: 30 B.C. – A.D. 217''. Leiden: Brill, 1986, ISBN 90-04-07644-1 , page 154&lt;/ref&gt; That meant that [[Charax Spasinou|Charax]] on the Persian Gulf was the sole remaining western terminus of the Indian trade route outside direct Roman control,&lt;ref name=&quot;Christol &amp; Nony, Rome, 171&quot;&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, Rome, 171&lt;/ref&gt; and such control was important in order to lower import prices and to limit the supposed drain of precious metals created by the deficit in Roman trade with the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Gary K. Young, ''Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy 31 BC – AD 305''. London: Routledge, 2001, ISBN 0-203-47093-1, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

That Charax traded with the Roman Empire, there can be no doubt, as its actual connections with merchants from [[Palmyra]] at the period are well documented in contemporary Palmyrene epigraph, which tells of various Palmyrene citizens honored for holding office in Charax.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Potts, ed., ''Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology''. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1988, ISBN 87-7289-051-7 , page 142&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Charax's rulers domains at the time possibly included the [[Bahrain]] islands (where a Palmyrene citizen held office, shortly after Trajan's death, as [[satrap]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 279&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– but then, the appointment was made by a Parthian king of Charax&lt;ref&gt;Julian Reade, ed.,''The Indian Ocean In Antiquity''. London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-7103-0435-8, page 279&lt;/ref&gt;) something which offered the possibility of extending Roman hegemony into the Persian Gulf itself.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 143&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind Trajan's campaign, in this case, would be one of breaking down a system of Far Eastern trade through small Semitic (&quot;Arab&quot;) cities under Parthia's control and to put it under Roman control instead.&lt;ref&gt;George Fadlo Hourani, ''Arab Seafaring in the Indian Ocean in Ancient and Early Medieval Times''. Princeton University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-691-00170-7, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia.&lt;ref&gt;Găzdac, 59&lt;/ref&gt; He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army, including a camel unit&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern, ''Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008, ISBN 978-1-84725-034-6 , page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– therefore apparently procuring Palmyrene support to his ultimate goal of annexing Charax. It has even been ventured that, when earlier in his campaign Trajan annexed Armenia, he was bound to annex the whole of Mesopotamia lest the Parthians interrupt the flux of trade from the Persian Gulf and/or foment trouble at the Roman frontier on the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Freya Stark, ''Rome on the Euphrates: The Story of a Frontier''.London: I.B. Tauris, 2012, ISBN 978-1-84885-314-0, page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians reject these motives, as the supposed Parthian &quot;control&quot; over the maritime Far Eastern trade route was, at best, conjectural and based on a selective reading of Chinese sources&amp;nbsp;– trade by land through Parthia seems to have been unhampered by Parthian authorities and left solely to the devices of private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Gary K. Young, ''Rome's Eastern Trade'', pages 176 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial activity in second century Mesopotamia seems to have been a general phenomenon, shared by many peoples within and without the Roman Empire, with no sign of a concerted Imperial policy towards it.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, The Ancient Economy, 158&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of the ''alimenta'', scholars like Moses Finley and [[Paul Veyne]] have considered the whole idea of a foreign trade &quot;policy&quot; behind Trajan's war anachronistic: according to them, the sole Roman concern with the Far Eastern luxuries trade&amp;nbsp;– besides collecting toll taxes and customs&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erdkamp, ''The Grain Market in the Roman Empire: A Social, Political and Economic Study''. Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 978-0-521-83878-8 , page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– was moral and involved frowning upon the &quot;softness&quot; of luxuries, but no economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, The Ancient Economy, 132; Paul Veyne, ''La Société Romaine'' , Paris: Seuil, 2001, ISBN 2-02-052360-4, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his controversial book on the Ancient economy, Finley considers Trajan's &quot;badly miscalculated and expensive assault on Parthia&quot; to be an example of Roman &quot;commercial wars&quot; that had in common the fact of existing only in the books of modern historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&quot;&gt;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative view is to see the campaign as triggered by the lure of territorial annexation and prestige,&lt;ref name=&quot;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&quot;/&gt; the sole motive ascribed by Cassius Dio.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bennett, Trajan, 188&lt;/ref&gt; As far as territorial conquest involved tax-collecting,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alexander Speidel: &quot;Bellicosissimus Princeps&quot;. In: Annette Nünnerich-Asmus ed., ''Traian. Ein Kaiser der Superlative am Beginn einer Umbruchzeit?'' Mainz 2002, pages 23/40.&lt;/ref&gt; especially of the 25% tax levied on all goods entering the Roman Empire, the ''tetarte'', one can say that Trajan's Parthian War had an &quot;economic&quot; motive.&lt;ref&gt;Steven E. Sidebotham, ''Roman Economic Policy in the Erythra Thalassa'', page 144&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there was the propaganda value of an Eastern conquest that would emulate, in Roman fashion, those of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathanael John Andrade, ''&quot;Imitation Greeks&quot;: Being Syrian in the Greco-Roman World (175 BCE – 275 CE)''. Doctoral Thesis, University of Michigan, 2009, page 192. Available at [http://search.proquest.com/docview/304928274]. Retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that emissaries from the [[Kushan Empire]] might have attended to the commemorative ceremonies for the Dacian War may have kindled in some Greco-Roman intellectuals like [[Plutarch]]&amp;nbsp;– who wrote about only 70,000 Roman soldiers being necessary to a conquest of India&amp;nbsp;– as well as in Trajan's closer associates, speculative dreams about the booty to be obtained by reproducing Macedonian Eastern conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul McLaughlin, ''Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India and China''. London: Continuum, 2010, ISBN 978-1-84725-235-7 , page 130&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is possible that the attachment of Trajan to an expansionist policy was supported by a powerful circle of conservative, [[war hawk]] senators from [[Hispania]], among them Licinius Sura.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, ''Un parti hispanique à Rome?: ascension des élites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste à Hadrien, 27 av. J.-C.-138 ap. J.-C''. Madrid: Casa de Velázquez, 2005, ISBN 84-95555-80-8 , pages 304 and 311&lt;/ref&gt; One can explain the campaign by the fact that, for the Romans, their empire was in principle unlimited, and that Trajan only took advantage of an opportunity to make idea and reality coincide.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter Hoyos, ed., ''A Companion to Roman Imperialism''. Leiden: Brill, 2012, ISBN 978-90-04-23593-9 , page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there are other modern historians who think that Trajan's original aims were purely military and quite modest: to assure a more defensible Eastern frontier for the Roman Empire, crossing Northern Mesopotamia along the course of the [[Khabur River]] in order to offer cover to a Roman Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was carefully planned in advance: ten legions were concentrated in the Eastern theater; since 111, the correspondence of Pliny the Younger witnesses to the fact that provincial authorities in Bithynia had to organize supplies for passing troops, and local city councils and their individual members had to shoulder part of the increased expenses by supplying troops themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''The Roman Near East, 31 B.C. – A.D. 337''. Harvard University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-674-77886-3 , page 103&lt;/ref&gt; The intended campaign, therefore, was immensely costly from its very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;M.Christol &amp; D. Nony, ''Rome et son Empire''. Paris: Hachette, 2003, ISBN 2-01-145542-1, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan marched first on Armenia, deposed the Parthian-appointed king (who was afterwards murdered while kept in the custody of Roman troops in an unclear incident, later described by [[Fronto]] as a breach of Roman good faith&lt;ref&gt;John Rich,Graham Shipley, eds., ''War and Society in the Roman World''. London: Routledge, 1993, ISBN 0-415-06644-1, page 235&lt;/ref&gt;) and annexed it to the Roman Empire as a province, receiving in passing the acknowledgement of Roman hegemony by various tribes in the Caucasus and on the Eastern coast of the Black Sea&amp;nbsp;– a process that kept him busy until the end of 114.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a Roman column under the legate [[Lusius Quietus]]&amp;nbsp;– an outstanding cavalry general&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Bengtson, ''Römische Geschichte: Republik und Kaiserzeit bis 284 n.

Paris:  L'Harmattan, ISBN 2-7475-7037-1, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Quietus' campaign had as its goal the extending of the newer, more defensible Roman border eastwards towards the [[Caspian Sea]] and northwards to the foothills of the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. De Laet, review of Lepper, ''Trajan's Parthian War''. ''L'Antiquité Classique'', 18-2, 1949, pages 487–489&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronology of subsequent events is uncertain, but it is generally believed that early in 115 Trajan launched a Mesopotamian campaign, marching down towards the Taurus mountains in order to consolidate territory between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. He placed permanent garrisons along the way to secure the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheldon|first=Rose Mary|title=Rome's Wars in Parthia: Blood in the Sand|date=2010|publisher=Vallentine Mitchell|location=London|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Trajan moved from west to east, Lusius Quietus moved with his army from the Caspian Sea towards the west, both armies performing a successful pincer movement,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 195&lt;/ref&gt; whose apparent result was to establish a Roman presence into the core Parthian hegemony, with Trajan taking the northern Mesopotamian cities of [[Nisibis]] and [[Suruç#History|Batnae]] and organizing a province of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], including the Kingdom of [[Osrhoene]]&amp;nbsp;– where King [[Abgar VII of Osroene|Abgaros&amp;nbsp;VII]] submitted to Trajan publicly&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Sartre,''The Middle East Under Rome''. Harvard University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-674-01683-1, page 146. According to Cassius Dio, the deal between Trajan and Abgaros was sealed by the king's son offering himself as Trajan's paramour—Bennett, 199&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as a Roman protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 199&lt;/ref&gt; This process seems to have been completed at the beginning of 116, when coins were issued announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia had been put under the authority of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 196; Christol &amp; Nony, Rome,171&lt;/ref&gt; The area between the Khabur River and the mountains around [[Singara]] seems to have been considered as the new frontier, and as such received a road surrounded by fortresses.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''Pax Romana'', 44&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some modern historians, the aim of the campaign of 116 was to achieve a &quot;preemptive demonstration&quot; aiming not toward the conquest of Parthia, but for tighter Roman control over the Eastern trade route. However, the overall scarcity of manpower for the Roman military establishment meant that the campaign was doomed from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Le Roux, IN Ségolène Demougin, ed., ''H.-G.

Geneva: Droz, 2006, ISBN 2-600-01099-8 , pages 182/183&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that no new legions were raised by Trajan before the Parthian campaign, maybe because the sources of new citizen recruits were already over-exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''Pax Romana'', 45&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as the sources allow a description of this campaign, it seems that one Roman division crossed the [[River Tigris|Tigris]] into [[Adiabene]], sweeping south and capturing [[Adenystrae]]; a second followed the river south, capturing [[Babylon]]; Trajan himself sailed down the [[Euphrates]] from [[Dura-Europos]]&amp;nbsp;– where a triumphal arch was erected in his honour&amp;nbsp;– through [[Ozogardana]], where he erected a &quot;tribunal&quot; still to be seen at the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]'s campaigns in the same area. Having come to the narrow strip of land between the Euphrates and the Tigris, he then dragged his fleet overland into the Tigris, capturing [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] and finally the Parthian capital of [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 197/199; Anthony R Birley, ''Hadrian: The Restless Emperor''.

The statue was torn down by [[Sassanids]] in 571/572&lt;/ref&gt; after which he sent the Senate a laurelled letter declaring the war to be at a close and bemoaning that he was too old to go on any further and repeat the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 199&quot;/&gt; Since Charax was a ''de facto'' independent kingdom whose connections to Palmyra were described above, Trajan's bid for the Persian Gulf may have coincided with Palmyrene interests in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Edwell, ''Between Rome and Persia: The Middle Euphrates, Mesopotamia and Palmyra Under Roman Control''. London: Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0-203-93833-X, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that the rulers of Charax had expansionist designs on Parthian Babylon, giving them a rationale for alliance with Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;E.

According to late literary sources (not backed by numismatic or inscriptional evidence) a province of [[Roman Assyria|Assyria]] was also proclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History''.Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-80918-5 , page 227&lt;/ref&gt; apparently covering the territory of Adiabene.&lt;ref&gt;Various authors have discussed the existence of the province and its location: André Maricq (La province d'Assyrie créée par Trajan. A propos de la guerre parthique de Trajan. In: Maricq: ''Classica et orientalia'', Paris 1965, pages 103/111) identifies Assyria with Southern Mesopotamia; Chris S. Lightfood (&quot;Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 80, 1990, pages 115–126), doubts the actual existence of the province; Maria G. Angeli Bertinelli (&quot;I Romani oltre l'Eufrate nel II secolo d. C. - le provincie di Assiria, di Mesopotamia e di Osroene&quot;, In ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', Bd. 9.1, Berlin 1976, pages 3/45) puts Assyria between Mesopotamia and Adiabene; Lepper (1948, page 146) considers Assyria and Adiabene to be the same province.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measures seem to have been considered regarding the fiscal administration of Indian trade&amp;nbsp;– or simply about the payment of customs (''portoria'') on goods traded on the Euphrates and Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 110&quot;&gt;Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 110; Peter Edwell, ''Between Rome and Persia'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that it was this &quot;streamlining&quot; of the administration of the newly conquered lands according to the standard pattern of Roman provincial administration in tax collecting, requisitions and the handling of local potentates' prerogatives, that triggered later resistance against Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;Janos Harmatta and others, eds., ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The development of sedentary and nomadic civilizations, 700 B.C. to A.D. 250''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999, ISBN 81-208-1408-8, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some modern historians, Trajan might have busied himself during his stay on the Persian Gulf with ordering raids on the Parthian coasts,&lt;ref&gt;Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh, ''Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography'',London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-7007-1098-1, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; as well as probing into extending Roman suzerainty over the mountaineer tribes holding the passes across the [[Zagros Mountains]] into the [[Iranian Plateau]] eastward, as well as establishing some sort of direct contact between Rome and the Kushan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Choisnel, 164/165&lt;/ref&gt; No attempt was made to expand into the Iranian Plateau itself, where the Roman army, with its relative weakness in cavalry, would be at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Kristinsson, ''Expansions: Competition and Conquest in Europe Since the Bronze Age''. Reykjavik:  ReykjavíkurAkademían, 2010, ISBN 978-9979-9922-1-9 , page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TrajanCoinAhinposhBuddhistMonasteryAfghanistan.jpg|thumb|A coin of Trajan, found together with coins of the [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kanishka]], at the [[Ahin Posh]] Buddhist Monastery, [[Afghanistan]]]]
However, as Trajan left the Persian Gulf for Babylon&amp;nbsp;– where he intended to offer sacrifice to Alexander in the house where he had died in 323&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 199&quot;&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 199&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a sudden outburst of Parthian resistance, led by a nephew of the Parthian king, [[Sanatruces II of Parthia|Sanatruces]], who had retained a cavalry force, possibly strengthened by the addition of [[Saka]] archers,&lt;ref&gt;Kaveh Farrokh, ''Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War''. Oxford: Osprey, 2007, ISBN 978-1-84603-108-3 , page 162&lt;/ref&gt; imperilled Roman positions in Mesopotamia and Armenia, something Trajan sought to deal with by forsaking direct Roman rule in Parthia proper, at least partially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 200&quot;&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan sent two armies towards Northern Mesopotamia: the first, under Lusius Quietus, recovered Nisibis and [[Edessa]] from the rebels, probably having King Abgarus deposed and killed in the process,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 200&quot;/&gt; while a second, under Appius Maximus Santra (probably a governor of Macedonia), was defeated, with Santra being killed.&lt;ref&gt;Julián González, ed. , ''Trajano Emperador De Roma'', 216&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 116, Trajan, with the assistance of Quietus and two other legates, M. [[Erucia (gens)|Erucius Clarus]] and Tiberius Julius Alexander Julianus,&lt;ref&gt;The last two were made consuls (''suffecti'') for the year 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;González, 216&lt;/ref&gt; defeated a Parthian army in a battle where Sanatruces was killed. After re-taking and burning Seleucia, Trajan then formally deposed the Parthian king [[Osroes I]] and put his own puppet ruler [[Parthamaspates]] on the throne. This event was commemorated in a coin so as to be presented as the reduction of Parthia to client kingdom status: &lt;small&gt;REX PARTHIS DATUS&lt;/small&gt;, &quot;a king is given to the Parthians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mommsen, ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''. London: Routledge, 1999, page 289&lt;/ref&gt; That done, Trajan retreated north in order to retain what he could of the new provinces of Armenia&amp;nbsp;– where he had already accepted an armistice in exchange for surrendering part of the territory to Sanatruces' son Vologeses&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett Trajan 203&quot;&gt;Bennett, Trajan,203&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 200&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpg|thumb|Bust of Trajan, [[Glyptothek]], [[Munich]]]]
It was at this point that Trajan's health started to fail him. The fortress city of [[Hatra]], on the [[Tigris]] in his rear, continued to hold out against repeated Roman assaults. He was personally present at the [[siege]], and it is possible that he suffered a heat stroke while in the blazing heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett, Trajan, 200&quot;/&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the Jews inside the Eastern Roman Empire, in Egypt, Cyprus and Cyrene&amp;nbsp;– this last province being probably the original trouble hotspot&amp;nbsp;– rose up in what probably was an outburst of religious rebellion against the local pagans, this widespread rebellion being afterwards named the [[Kitos War]].&lt;ref&gt;James J. Bloom, ''The Jewish Revolts Against Rome, A.D. 66–135: A Military Analysis''. McFarland, 2010, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; Another rebellion flared up among the Jewish communities of Northern Mesopotamia, probably part of a general reaction against Roman occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan was forced to withdraw his army in order to put down the revolts. He saw this withdrawal as simply a temporary setback, but he was destined never to command an army in the field again, turning his Eastern armies over to Lusius Quietus, who meanwhile had been made governor of Judaea and might have had to deal earlier with some kind of Jewish unrest in the province.&lt;ref&gt;A precise description of events in Judaea at the time being impossible, due to the non-historical character of the Jewish (rabbinic) sources, and the silence of the non-Jewish ones: William David Davies,Louis Finkelstein,Steven T. Katz, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman–Rabbinic Period''.Cambridge U. Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-521-77248-8 ,page 100&lt;/ref&gt; Quietus discharged his commission successfully, so much that the war was afterward named after him&amp;nbsp;– ''Kitus'' being a corruption of ''Quietus''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Quietus was promised a consulate&lt;ref&gt;He was already consul ''in absentia'': Tanja Gawlich, ''Der Aufstand der jüdischen Diaspora unter Traian''. GRIN Verlag, 2007, ISBN 978-3-640-32753-9, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year (118) for his victories, but he was killed before this could occur, during the bloody purge that opened [[Hadrian]]'s reign, in which Quietus and three other former consuls were sentenced to death after being tried on a vague charge of conspiracy by the (secret) court of the Praetorian Prefect [[Publius Acilius Attianus|Attianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Margret Fell, ed., ''Erziehung, Bildung, Recht''. Berlim: Dunker &amp; Hunblot, 1994, ISBN 3-428-08069-6 , page 448&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that Quietus and his colleagues were executed on Hadrian's direct orders, for fear of their popular standing with the army and their close connections to Trajan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett Trajan 203&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des Juifs, Troisième période, I – Chapitre III – Soulèvement des Judéens sous Trajan et Adrien&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the next prominent Roman figure in charge of the repression of the Jewish revolt, the equestrian Quintus [[Marcius Turbo]], who had dealt with the rebel leader from Cyrene, Loukuas,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 195/196&lt;/ref&gt; retained Hadrian's trust, eventually becoming his [[Praetorian Prefect]]. Apparently, Hadrian could not allow the continued existence alongside him of a group of independent-minded senatorial generals inherited from his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''A Companion to Roman Imperialism'', 325&lt;/ref&gt; As all four consulars were senators of the highest standing and as such generally regarded as able to take imperial power (''capaces imperii''), Hadrian seems to have decided on a preemptive strike against these prospective rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Marasco, ed., ''Political Autobiographies and Memoirs in Antiquity: A Brill Companion''. Leiden: Brill, 2011, ISBN 978-90-04-18299-8 , page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==
[[File:Bridge Alcantara.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Alcántara Bridge]], widely hailed as a masterpiece of [[Roman engineering]]]]
[[File:London Tower Trajan.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Statue of Trajan]] at [[Tower Hill]], London]]

Early in 117, Trajan grew ill and set out to sail back to Italy. His health declined throughout the spring and summer of 117, something publicly acknowledged by the fact that a bronze bust displayed at the time in [[Roman Baths of Ankara|the public baths of Ancyra]] showed him clearly aged and emaciated.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Trajan, 201&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he had reached [[Gazipaşa|Selinus]] (modern [[Gazipasa]]) in [[Cilicia]], which was afterwards called ''Trajanopolis'', he suddenly died from [[edema]] on 8&amp;nbsp;August. Some say that Trajan had adopted [[Hadrian]] as his successor, but others that it was his wife [[Pompeia Plotina]] who assured the succession to Hadrian by keeping his death secret and afterwards hiring someone to impersonate Trajan by speaking with a tired voice behind a curtain, well after Trajan had died. Dio, who tells this narrative, offers his father&amp;nbsp;– the then governor of Cilicia Apronianus&amp;nbsp;– as a source, and therefore his narrative is possibly grounded on contemporary rumor, or maybe on common Roman displeasure at an empress meddling in political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Santoro L'Hoir, ''Tragedy, Rhetoric, and the Historiography of Tacitus' Annales''.University of Michigan Press, 2006, ISBN 0-472-11519-7 , page 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian held an ambiguous position during Trajan's reign: after commanding [[Legio I Minervia]] during the Dacian Wars, he had been relieved from front-line duties at the decisive stage of the Second Dacian War, being sent to govern the newly created province of [[Pannonia Inferior]];&lt;ref&gt;Birley,50 &amp; 52&lt;/ref&gt; had pursued a senatorial career without particular distinction; had not been officially adopted by Trajan (although he received from him decorations and other marks of distinction that made him hope for the succession);&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 52&lt;/ref&gt; received no post after his 108 consulate,&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, ''Un parti hispanique à Rome?'', 306&lt;/ref&gt; with no other honors than being made [[Archon eponymos]] for Athens in 111/112;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 64&lt;/ref&gt; and had probably not taken part in the Parthian War. The literary sources tell that Trajan had considered others, such as the jurist [[Neratius Priscus]], as heir.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 50&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hadrian was eventually entrusted with the governorship of Syria at the time of Trajan's death, was Trajan's cousin, and was married to Trajan's grandniece,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History''. Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-80918-5 , page 229&lt;/ref&gt; all making him as good as heir designate.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''Pax Romana'', 53&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, Hadrian was born in Hispania and seems to have been well connected with the powerful group of Spanish senators influential at Trajan's court through his ties to Plotina and the Prefect Attianus.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, ''Un parti hispanique à Rome?'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Hadrian during his reign did not pursue Trajan's senatorial policy can account for the &quot;crass hostility&quot; shown him by literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines'', 379&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware that the Parthian campaign was an enormous setback, and that it revealed that the Roman Empire had no means for an ambitious program of conquests,&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The German historian Mommsen, who was no lover of Hadrian - &quot;a repellent manner , and a venomous, envious and malicious nature&quot; - at the same time acknowledged that, in renouncing to Trajan's conquests, Hadrian was &quot;doing what the situation clearly required&quot;. Mommsen, ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''. London: Routledge, 2005, page 290&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hadrian]]'s first act as emperor was to abandon&amp;nbsp;– outwardly out of his own free will&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', Hadrian declared that he was following the precedent set by [[Cato the Elder]] towards the Macedonians, who &quot;were to be set free because they could not be protected&quot; – something Birley  sees as an unconvincing precedent: Birley, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the distant and indefensible Mesopotamia and to restore Armenia, as well as Osrhoene, to the Parthian hegemony under Roman suzerainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 110&quot;/&gt; However, all the other territories conquered by Trajan were retained. Roman friendship ties with Charax (also known by the name of Mesene) were also retained (although it is debated whether this had to do more with trade concessions than with common Roman policy of exploiting dissensions amid the Empire's neighbors).&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Potter, ''The Inscriptions on the Bronze Herakles from Mesene: Vologeses IV's War with Rome and the Date of Tacitus' &quot;Annales&quot;''. ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' Bd. 88, (1991), pp. 277–290; Young, ''Rome's Eastern Trade'', 132&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's ashes were laid to rest underneath Trajan's column, the monument commemorating his success.

==Building activities==
Trajan was a prolific builder in Rome and the provinces, and many of his buildings were erected by the gifted architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]. Notable structures include [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Bridge]], [[Alcántara Bridge]], the road and canal around the [[Iron Gates]] (see [[#Conquest of Dacia|conquest of Dacia]]), and possibly the [[Alconétar Bridge]]. Some historians also attribute the construction of the Babylon fortress in Egypt to Trajan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=A. J.|title=Babylon of Egypt: A study in the history of Old Cairo|year=1914|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remains of the fort is what is now known as the Church of Mar Girgis and its surrounding buildings. In order to build his forum and the adjacent brick market that also held his name Trajan had vast areas of the surrounding hillsides leveled.

==Trajan's legacy==

Unlike many lauded rulers in history, Trajan's reputation has survived undiminished for nearly nineteen centuries.

Ancient sources on Trajan's personality and accomplishments are unanimously positive. Pliny the Younger, for example, celebrates Trajan in his panegyric as a wise and just emperor and a moral man. [[Cassius Dio]] added that he always remained dignified and fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Dio Cassius, Epitome of Book 6; 21.2–3&lt;/ref&gt; After the setbacks of the [[Crisis of the Third Century|third century]], Trajan, together with Augustus, became in the Later Roman Empire the paragon of the most positive traits of the Imperial order.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Strobel, ''Das Imperium Romanum im &quot;3. Jahrhundert&quot;: Modell einer historischen Krise? Zur Frage mentaler Strukturen breiterer Bevölkerungsschichten in der Zeit von Marc Aurel bis zum Ausgang des 3. Jh.n.Chr''. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1993, ISBN 3-515-05662-9, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christianisation]] of Rome resulted in further embellishment of his legend: it was commonly said in [[medieval]] times that [[Pope Gregory I]], through divine intercession, resurrected Trajan from the dead and baptized him into the Christian faith. An account of this features in the [[Golden Legend]].

Some theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] discussed Trajan as an example of a virtuous pagan. In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante]], following this legend, sees the spirit of Trajan in the Heaven of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] with other historical and mythological persons noted for their justice. Also, a mural of Trajan stopping to provide justice for a poor widow is present in the first terrace of [[Purgatory]] as a lesson to those who are purged for being proud.

He also features in ''[[Piers Plowman]]''. An episode referred to as the [[justice of Trajan]] was reflected in several art works.

In the 18th-century King [[Charles III of Spain]] commissioned [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] to paint ''The Triumph of Trajan'' on the ceiling of the banquet hall of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]&amp;nbsp;– considered among the best works of this artist.

It was only during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that this legacy began to be contested, when [[Edward Gibbon]] expressed doubts about the militarized character of Trajan's reign in contrast to the &quot;moderate&quot; practices of his immediate successors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mankin, &quot;Edward Gibbon: Historian in Space&quot;, ''A Companion to Enlightenment Historiography'', Leiden: Brill, 2013, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] adopted a divided stance towards Trajan, at some point of his posthumously published lectures even speaking about his &quot;vainglory&quot; (''Scheinglorie'').&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors'', page 488&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen also speaks of Trajan's &quot;insatiable, unlimited lust for conquest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Römische Kaisergeschichte''. Munich: 1992, page 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was exactly this military character of Trajan's reign that attracted his early twentieth century biographer, the Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] historian Roberto Paribeni, who in his 1927 two volume biography ''Optimus Princeps'' described Trajan's reign as the acme of the Roman principate, which he saw as Italy's patrimony.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. G. Gibson, ed. ''Robert Graves and the Classical Tradition''. Oxford University Press, 2015, ISBN 978-0-19-873805-3 ,pages 257/258&lt;/ref&gt; Following in Paribeni's footsteps, the German historian Alfred Heuss saw in Trajan &quot;the accomplished human embodiment of the imperial title&quot;(''die ideale Verkörperung des humanen Kaiserbegriffs'').&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Heuß: ''Römische Geschichte'', 4. Braunschweig 1976, pages 344ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's first English-language biography by [[Julian Bennett (archaeologist)|Julian Bennett]] is also a positive one in that it assumes that Trajan was an active policy-maker concerned with the management of the empire as a whole&amp;nbsp;– something his reviewer Lendon considers an anachronistic outlook that sees in the Roman emperor a kind of modern administrator.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Lendon, &quot;Three Emperors and the Roman Imperial Regime&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'' 94 (1998) pp. 87–93&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the Romanian historian Eugen Cizek took a more nuanced view as he described the changes in the ''personal'' ideology of Trajan's reign, stressing the fact that it became ever more autocratic and militarized, especially after 112 and towards the Parthian War (as &quot;only an universal monarch, a ''kosmocrator'', could dictate his law to the East&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jean-Claude, &quot;Eugen Cizek, ''L'époque de Trajan. Circonstances politiques et problèmes idéologiques'' [compte rendu]. ''Bulletin de l'Association Guillaume Budé'', Année 1985, Volume 44,  Numéro 4  pp. 425–426. Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/bude_1247-6862_1985_num_44_4_1698_t1_0425_0000_2]. Retrieved December 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The biography by the German historian Karl Strobel stresses the continuity between Domitian's and Trajan's reigns, saying that Trajan's rule followed the same autocratic and sacred character of Domitian's, culminating in a failed Parthian adventure intended as the crown of his personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Gering, Rezension zu: Karl Strobel, Kaiser Traian&amp;nbsp;– Eine Epoche der Weltgeschichte,''Frankfurter elektronische Rundschau zur Altertumskunde'' 15 (2011), [http://s145739614.online.de/fera/ausgabe15/Gering.pdf]. Retrieved December&amp;nbsp;15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in modern French historiography that Trajan's reputation becomes most markedly deflated: Paul Petit writes about Trajan's portraits as a &quot;lowbrow boor with a taste for booze and boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''Histoire Générale de L'Empire Romain, 1: Le Haut Empire (27 av. J.C.- 161 apr. J.C.)''. Paris: Seuil, 1974, ISBN 978-2-02-004969-6, page 166&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul Veyne, what is to be retained from Trajan's &quot;stylish&quot; qualities was that he was the last Roman emperor to think of the empire as a purely Italian and Rome-centered hegemony of conquest. In contrast, his successor Hadrian would stress the notion of the empire as ecumenical and of the Emperor as universal benefactor and not ''kosmocrator''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne, ''Le Pain et le Cirque'', 654/655&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian is known for building [[Hadrian's Wall]], which marked the northern limit of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. He also rebuilt the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] and constructed the [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. [[Philhellene]] in most of his tastes, he is considered by some to have been a [[humanism|humanist]], and he is regarded as one of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]].

Hadrian was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus into a [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] family. Although [[Italica]] near [[Santiponce]] (in modern-day Spain) is often considered his birthplace, his actual place of birth remains uncertain. However, it is generally accepted that he came from a family with centuries-old roots in Hispania.&lt;ref name=&quot;cat.inist.fr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16389979|title=Itálica, Sedes natalis de Adriano. 31 textos histÓricos y argumentos para una secular polémica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary T.

VIII. 6]: &quot;...nam eum (Hadrianum) Traianus, quamquam consobrinae suae filium...&quot; and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html SHA, ''Vita Hadr''. I, 2]: ''...pater Aelius Hadrianus cognomento Afer fuit, consobrinus Traiani imperatoris.''&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan did not officially designate an heir, but according to his wife [[Pompeia Plotina]], Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death. Trajan's wife and his friend [[Lucius Licinius Sura|Licinius Sura]] were well-disposed towards Hadrian, and he may well have owed his succession to them.&lt;ref&gt;After A.&amp;nbsp;M. Canto, in [http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/ghi/02130181/articulos/GERI0303120305A.PDF UCM.es], specifically pp.&amp;nbsp;322, 328, 341 and footnote 124, where she stands out SHA, ''Vita Hadr.'' 1.2: ''pro filio habitus'' (years 93); 3.2: ''ad bellum Dacicum Traianum familiarius prosecutus est'' (year 101) or, principally, 3.7: ''quare adamante gemma quam Traianus a Nerva acceperat donatus ad spem successionis erectus est'' (year 107).&lt;/ref&gt;

During his reign, Hadrian travelled to nearly every province of the Empire. An ardent admirer of Greece, he sought to make [[Athens]] the cultural capital of the Empire and ordered the construction of many opulent temples in the city. He used his relationship with his Greek lover [[Antinous]] to underline his philhellenism and led to the creation of one of the most popular cults of ancient times. He spent extensive amounts of time with the military; he usually wore military attire and even dined and slept amongst the soldiers. He ordered military training and drilling to be more rigorous and even made use of false reports of attack to keep the army alert.

Upon his accession to the throne, Hadrian withdrew from Trajan's conquests in [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], and even considered abandoning [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]]. Late in his reign he suppressed the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in [[Judaea Province|Judaea]], renaming the province [[Syria Palaestina]]. In 136 an ailing Hadrian adopted [[Lucius Aelius]] as his heir, but the latter died suddenly two years later. In 138 Hadrian resolved to adopt [[Antoninus Pius]] if he would in turn adopt [[Marcus Aurelius]] and Aelius's son [[Lucius Verus]] as his own eventual successors. Antoninus agreed, and soon afterward Hadrian died at [[Baiae]].&lt;ref&gt;Royston Lambert, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

As is the case with his predecessor, [[Trajan]], we lack a continuous account of the political history of Hadrian's reign. What we have in the way of such an account, as on Trajan's reign, is Book&amp;nbsp;69 of the work ''Roman History'' by [[Cassius Dio]]. Dio's original text of this particular book is lost; what survives is a brief, much later, Byzantine era abridgment by the 11th century monk Xiphilinius, who made a selection from Dio's account of Hadrian's reign based on his mostly religious interests, covering the Bar Kokhba war relatively fully to the exclusion of much else. Hadrian is the first imperial biography of the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', but the notorious unreliability of that work (&quot;a mish mash of actual fact, [[cloak and dagger]], [[sword and sandal]], with a sprinkling of ''[[Ubu Roi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain''. Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4 , p.&amp;nbsp;312. In the French original: ''de l'[[Alexandre Dumas]], du [[Peplum film genre|péplum]] et un peu d'Ubu Roi''.&lt;/ref&gt; does not allow its use as a source without care. Hadrian's biography is generally considered to be relatively free of fictional additions.&lt;ref&gt;Danèel den Hengst, ''Emperors and Historiography: Collected Essays on the Literature of the Roman Empire''. Leiden: Brill, 2010, ISBN 978-90-04-17438-2 , p.&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Greek authors such as [[Philostratus]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], who wrote shortly after Hadrian's reign, offer information on Hadrian's relations with the provincial Greek world, and [[Fronto]], in his Latin correspondence, sheds some light on the general character of the reign's internal policies.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Taliaferro Boatwright, ''Hadrian and the Cities of the Roman Empire''. Princeton University Press, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;20/26&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of Trajan, using epigraphical, numismatic, archaeological and other non-literary sources is absolutely necessary in tracing a detailed historical account.

==Early life==
Hadrian was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in either [[Italica]]&lt;ref&gt;Alicia M. Canto, &quot;Itálica, ''patria'' y ciudad natal de Adriano (31 textos históricos y argumentos contra ''Vita Hadr''. His father died in AD 86 when Hadrian was at the age of 10. 1, 3&quot;, ''Athenaeum'' vol. 92.2, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;367–408 [http://dobc.unipv.it/dipscant/athenaeum/athenaeum.html UNIPV.it]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, in &quot;Hadrian and Italica&quot; (''Journal of Roman Studies'', LIV, 1964; pp.&amp;nbsp;142–149) examined the question and concluded that Rome was his birthplace. Against this is the argument of Canto, who argues that only one ancient source gives Hadrian's birth as Rome (SHA, ''Vita Hadr'' 2,4, probably interpolated), opposite to 25 ancient authors who affirm that he was born in Italica. Among these ancient sources is included his own imperial horoscope, which remained in the famous Antigonus of Nicaea's collection (end of the 2nd century). This horoscope was well studied by prominent authors such as F.&amp;nbsp;H. Cramer, ''Astrology in Roman Law and Politics'', Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 37 , Philadelphia, 1954 (repr. 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zv0UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 see] for Hadrian pp.&amp;nbsp;162–178, fn. 121b and 122, etc.: &quot;''...Hadrian&amp;nbsp;– whose horoscope is absolutely certain&amp;nbsp;– surely was born in southern Spain... (in) SHA, Hadrian, 2, 4, the birth was erroneously assigned to Rome instead of Italica, the actual birth-place of Hadrian''...&quot;, or O.&amp;nbsp;Neugebauer and H.&amp;nbsp;B. Van Hoesen in their magisterial compilation ''Greek Horoscopes'', Mem.Amer.Philos.Soc. nr. 48, Philadelphia, 1959, nr.&amp;nbsp;L76, see now [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEgnLpm06zQC here, ed. 1987] pp.&amp;nbsp;80, 90–1, and his footnote 19. They came also to the conclusion that the astronomic parallel of the Hadrian’s birth is situated in the Baetica, today Andalusia: &quot;...''L40 agrees exactly with the geographical latitude of southern Spain, the place of origin of Hadrian and his family...''&quot;.. &quot;''since Hadrian was born in Italica (southern Spain, near Seville, latitude about 37° 30)''...&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; from a well-established Roman family with centuries-old roots in Italica, [[Hispania Baetica]] (the republican [[Hispania]] Ulterior), near the present-day location of [[Seville]], Spain.

Although it was an accepted part of Hadrian's personal history that he was born in Spain, his ''Historia Augusta'' biography states that he was born in Rome on 24&amp;nbsp;January 76, of an ethnically Hispanic with vague paternal links to Italy. However, this may be a complimentary fiction coined in order to make Hadrian appear as a natural-born Roman instead of a provincial, since his parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all born and raised in Hispania.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', 'Hadrian', I-II, here explicitly citing the autobiography. This is one of the passages in the Historia Augusta where there is no reason to suspect invention. But see now the Canto's 31 contrary arguments in the ''op.cit. supra''; among them, in the same Historia Augusta and, from the same author, Aelius Spartianus, ''Vita Sev.'' 21: ''Falsus est etiam ipse Traianus in '''suo municipe''' ac nepote diligendo'', see also [[:es:Adriano#cite note-nacimiento-0]], and, characterizing him as a man of provinces (Canto, ''ibid''.): ''Vita Hadr''. 1,3: ''Quaesturam gessit Traiano quater et Articuleio consulibus, in qua cum orationem imperatoris in senatu '''agrestius pronuntians risus esset''', usque ad summam peritiam et facundiam Latinis operam dedit''&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer]], who as a [[Roman Senate|senator]] of [[praetor]]ian rank would spend much of his time in Rome, away from his homeland of Hispania.&lt;ref&gt;On the numerous senatorial families from Spain residing at Rome and its vicinity around the time of Hadrian’s birth see R.&amp;nbsp;Syme, 'Spaniards at Tivoli', in ''Roman Papers IV'' (Oxford, 1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–114. Tivoli (Tibur) was of course the site of Hadrian's own imperial villa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian's known paternal ancestry can be partially linked to a family from Hadria, modern [[Atri, Italy|Atri]], an ancient town of [[Picenum]] in Italy. This family had settled in Italica in Hispania Baetica soon after its founding by [[Scipio Africanus]] several centuries before Hadrian's birth. His father Afer, was a paternal cousin of the future Emperor Trajan. Both Afer and Trajan were born and raised in Hispania. His mother was Domitia [[Paulina]], who came from Gades ([[Cádiz]]). Paulina was a daughter of a distinguished Hispano-Roman senatorial family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royston Lambert pp.31&quot;&gt;Royston Lambert, ''Beloved And God'', pp.31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal great-grandmother is of unknown origin, which means that the exact amount of his paternal ancestry that can actually be linked to Italy (outside of nonspecific claims of forebears from Picenum from centuries earlier) is ultimately unknown.

Hadrian's elder sister and only sibling was Aelia Domitia Paulina, married with the triple consul [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus]], his niece was Julia Serviana Paulina, and his great-nephew was Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator, from [[Barcelona|Barcino]] ([[Barcelona]]). His parents died in 86 when Hadrian was ten, and the boy then became a ward of both Trajan and [[Publius Acilius Attianus]] (who was later Trajan's Praetorian Prefect).&lt;ref name=&quot;Royston Lambert pp.31&quot;/&gt; Hadrian was schooled in various subjects particular to young [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] of the day, and was so fond of learning [[Greece|Greek]] literature that he was nicknamed ''Graeculus'' (&quot;Greekling&quot;).

Hadrian visited Italica when (or never left it until) he was 14 years old, when he was recalled by Trajan, who thereafter looked after his development. He never returned to Italica although it was later made a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Aul.Gell., ''Noct.Att.'' XVI, 13, 4, and some inscriptions in the city with ''C(olonia) A(elia) A(ugusta) I(talica)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
After his start at the [[Vigintisexviri|vigintivirate]] (the minor posts whose holding qualified one for the senatorial ''cursus''), Hadrian's first military service was as a [[tribune]] of the [[Legio II Adiutrix|Legio&amp;nbsp;II ''Adiutrix'']]. Exceptionally, he held a second tribunate when he was afterwards transferred to [[Legio V Macedonica]] and in such a capacity was chosen to inform Trajan of his adoption by [[Nerva]]. He was then retained in Germany&amp;nbsp;– presumably on Trajan's orders&amp;nbsp;– and was transferred to hold an even more exceptional third tribunate in [[Legio XXII Primigenia]]. The fact that he had three spells of military service&amp;nbsp;– instead of just one or two, as was customary to the regular senator&amp;nbsp;– points to a thorough military career&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Opper, ''The Emperor Hadrian''. British Museum Press, 2008 , page 39&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Hadrian an advantage, in terms of military expertise, over most scions from older senatorial families.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Fündling , ''Kommentar zur Vita Hadriani der Historia Augusta'' (= Antiquitas. Reihe 4: Beiträge zur Historia-Augusta-Forschung, Serie 3: Kommentare, Bände 4.1 und 4.2). Habelt, Bonn 2006, ISBN 3-7749-3390-1 , p.&amp;nbsp;351.&lt;/ref&gt; When Nerva died in 98, Hadrian rushed to inform Trajan personally, coming in advance of the official envoy sent by the governor, Hadrian's brother-in-law and rival Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus&amp;nbsp;– but this may be a fiction coined by Hadrian himself.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Grainger, ''Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96–99''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-34958-3 , page 109; Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Dominic Rathbone, eds. ''The Cambridge Ancient History - XI''. Cambridge U. P.: 2000, ISBN 0-521-26335-2 , p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 101 Hadrian began his senatorial career by being chosen [[quaestor]], being charged with the task of reading Trajan's speeches to the Senate&amp;nbsp;– and possibly composing them himself. Next, he was ''ab actis senatus'', charged with the task of keeping the Senate's record of its proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, IN Barrett, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he was created [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. From then on he began to be surrounded by stories about omens and portents that supposedly announced his future imperial condition.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the probably bogus anecdote in ''Historia Augusta'' that tells that as tribune he had lost a cloak that emperors never wore: Michael Reiche, ed., ''Antike Autobiographien: Werke, Epochen, Gattungen''. Köln: Böhlau, 2005, ISBN 3-412-10505-8 , p.&amp;nbsp;225&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Historia Augusta'', Hadrian had a great interest in [[astrology]] and [[divination]] and had been announced his future accession to the Empire by a grand-uncle who was himself a skilled astrologer.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, ''Measuring Heaven: Pythagoras and His Influence on Thought and Art in Antiquity and the Middle Ages''. Cornell University Press: 2007, ISBN 978-0-8014-4396-1 , page 177&lt;/ref&gt; It is also noteworthy, however, that Trajan did not make Hadrian a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]], so as to allow him to become consul earlier, without having to hold the office of tribune.&lt;ref&gt;Fündling, 335&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Dacian War]], Hadrian was a member of Trajan's personal entourage, being excused from his military post in order to take office in Rome as tribune of the plebs. During the [[Second Dacian War]], he was also relieved early from Trajan's personal attendance, becoming [[legatus|legate]] of a [[Roman legion|legion]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Legio I Minervia]]&amp;nbsp;– and afterwards governor of [[Pannonia Inferior|Lower Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, 133&quot;&gt;Bowman, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if Hadrian had received the signal honour of assuming the tribunate of the plebs a year earlier than was customary, at the same time he departed early from both Dacian campaigns&amp;nbsp;– a sign that Trajan wanted to have him out of his way.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Marasco, ed., ''Political Autobiographies and Memoirs in Antiquity: A Brill Companion''. Leiden: Brill, 2011, ISBN 978-90-04-18299-8 , page 375&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time that he married Trajan's grandniece, [[Vibia Sabina]], in a move that seems to have been conceived by the empress Plotina, on whose favour he always counted. Also, he counted on the support of the bride's mother, Trajan's niece [[Salonina Matidia]],&lt;ref&gt;Marasco, 375&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Trajan's sister [[Ulpia Marciana]]. However, Trajan seemed to be far less enthusiastic. The subsequent relationship between Hadrian and Sabina was exceptionally and scandalously poor, even for a marriage of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Allen, ''The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia'', Jefferson: Mcfarland, 2006, ISBN 978-0-7864-2349-1 , page 120&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Hadrian was at the time involved in some unexplained quarrel told in ''Historia Augusta'' around his relationships with Trajan's boy favourites,&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict''. Harvard University Press, 2008, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had supposedly tried to groom.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Balch,Carolyn Osiek, eds., ''Early Christian Families in Context: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue''. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0-8028-3986-X , page 301&lt;/ref&gt; All these circumstances might explain the downturn experienced by Hadrian's fortunes late during Trajan's reign. Hadrian failed to achieve the honour of a regular consulate before his own reign, being only suffect consul for 108.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R Birley, ''Hadrian: The Restless Emperor''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-415-16544-X , page 54&lt;/ref&gt; As much as Trajan surely actively promoted Hadrian's advancement, at the same time he did it in a very measured, careful way.&lt;ref&gt;Fündling,351&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, when Sabina's grandmother Ulpia Marciana died between 112 and 114, she was [[Deification|deified]] by the Senate and her daughter Salonina Matidia made a &quot;princess of the blood&quot;, an [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. This made Hadrian, late during Trajan's reign, the first senator in history to have an ''Augusta'' as his mother-in-law, something that his contemporaries could not fail to notice.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Brun, &quot;Matidia die Jüngere&quot;, IN Anne Kolb, ed., ''Augustae. Machtbewusste Frauen am römischen Kaiserhof?: Herrschaftsstrukturen und Herrschaftspraxis II. Akten der Tagung in Zürich 18.-20. 9. 2008''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010, ISBN 978-3-05-004898-7 , page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at that time, in his mid-twenties, that Hadrian travelled to Greece, where he attended the lectures of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]], at the time living in the city of [[Nicopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian''. Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2006, ISBN 978-0-465-02497-1 , page 578&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[archon]] in Athens for a brief time, and was elected an Athenian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;The inscription in footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians awarded Hadrian a statue with an inscription in the [[Theater of Dionysus]] offering a detailed account of his ''cursus honorum'', which confirms and expands the one in ''Historia Augusta''.&lt;ref&gt;John Bodel, ed. , ''Epigraphic Evidence: Ancient History From Inscriptions''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2006, ISBN 0-415-11623-6 , page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian's career before Trajan's death was a regular one for a high ranking Roman senator, but without any particular distinction befitting an heir designate.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Christopher. ''Ancient Rome: a Military and Political History''. Cambridge U. Press: 2007, ISBN 0-521-80918-5 , page 229&lt;/ref&gt; After the 112 Athenian archontate, we hear no more of Hadrian before Trajan's Parthian War, and it is possible that he remained in Greece until being summoned into the imperial retinue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, 133&quot;/&gt;

Hadrian was involved in the wars against the [[Dacia]]ns (as legate of the V&amp;nbsp;''Macedonica'' and reputedly won awards from Trajan for his successes. Hadrian's military skill is not well-attested due to a lack of military action during his reign; however, his keen interest in, and knowledge of, the army and his demonstrated skill of leadership show possible strategic talent.

Hadrian joined Trajan's expedition against [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] as a legate on Trajan's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, ''Hadrian the Restless Emperor'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Neither during the first victorious phase, nor during the second phase of the war when rebellion swept Mesopotamia did Hadrian do anything of note. However, when the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] had to be sent to sort out renewed troubles in Dacia, Hadrian was appointed as a replacement, giving him an independent command.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan, seriously ill by that time, decided to return to Rome while Hadrian remained in Syria to guard the Roman rear. In practical terms, that meant that Hadrian was ''de facto'' general commander of the Eastern Roman army, something that made his power position as a potential claimant to the throne unchallengeable.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Strobel: ''Kaiser Traian. Eine Epoche der Weltgeschichte''. Regensburg:  2010, page 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan only got as far as [[Selinus]] before he became too ill to go further. While Hadrian may have been the obvious choice as successor, he had never been adopted as Trajan's heir. It is possible that Trajan never wanted to commit himself earlier with the appointment of a successor, as the great number of potential claimants made it possible that the definite choice of an heir would be seen as an abdication and therefore dash the chance for a transmission of power in an orderly way.&lt;ref&gt;Fündling, 384; Strobel, 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Trajan lay dying, nursed by his wife, Plotina, and closely watched by Prefect Attianus, he could at last have adopted Hadrian as heir. Since the document was signed by Plotina, it has been suggested that Trajan may have already been dead.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Speller, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a telltale sign, it has been discovered that Trajan's young manservant Phaedimus died in his late twenties a few days after Trajan's passing away, in Selinus, and that his body was interred in Rome only twelve years later. As Phaedimus was probably very close to Trajan, perhaps he was killed (or killed himself) for fear of his being posed awkward questions.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if Trajan's adoption of Hadrian was genuine, it came too late to keep other potential claimants from having wrong ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', 55&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Hadrian had to act on his own to secure his newly won position.
 
Hadrian quickly secured the support of the legions&amp;nbsp;– one potential opponent, the Moorish prince and outstanding general [[Lusius Quietus]], was promptly dismissed:&lt;ref&gt;Royston Lambert, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; by taking from Quietus his personal guard of Moorish auxiliaries, Hadrian could afterwards safely relieve him from his post as governor of Judea.&lt;ref&gt;Cizek, Eugen.

According to these papers, Hadrian had been adopted ''in absentia'' on 9&amp;nbsp;August 117 (Trajan having died on 8&amp;nbsp;August 8), which was technically irregular, as the two parties concerned were required to be present at the ceremony. The rumour of a falsified document of adoption carried little weight, as Hadrian's legitimacy arose from the endorsement of the Senate&amp;nbsp;– and above all from the support of the Syrian armies.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Lindsay, ''Adoption in the Roman World''. Cambridge University Press: 2009, ISBN 978-0-521-76050-8 , page 209&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, various public ceremonies were organized&amp;nbsp;– Egyptian papyri tell of one organized between 117 and 118 CE&amp;nbsp;– extolling the fact that Hadrian had been divinely chosen by his deified father and by the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Peppard, ''The Son of God in the Roman World: Divine Sonship in Its Social and Political Context''.

Hadrian did not at first go to Rome&amp;nbsp;– he was busy sorting out the East and suppressing the Jewish revolt that had broken out under Trajan, then moving on to sort out the [[Danube]] frontier. Instead, Attianus, Hadrian's former guardian, was put in charge in Rome. There he &quot;discovered&quot; a conspiracy involving four leading Senators including Lusius Quietus and demanded of the Senate their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Speller&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Speller.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no question of a public trial&amp;nbsp;– they were hunted down and killed out of hand. Because Hadrian was not in Rome at the time, he was able to claim that Attianus had acted on his own initiative. According to Elizabeth Speller, the real reason for their deaths was that they were Trajan's men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Speller&quot;/&gt; Or better, the reason for their elimination is simply that all four were prominent senators of consular rank and, as such, prospective candidates for the imperial office (''capaces imperii'').&lt;ref&gt;Marasco, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the four consulars were the chiefs of a [[war hawk]] group of senators that was committed to Trajan's expansionist policies, which Hadrian intended to change.&lt;ref&gt;M. Christol &amp; D.&amp;nbsp;Nony, ''Rome et son Empire''. Paris: Hachette, 2003, ISBN 2-01-14-5542-1 , page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The consistent refusal of Hadrian to expand frontiers was to remain a bone of contention between him and the Senate throughout his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Crawford Wilson, &quot;Image and ideology : Roman imperialism and frontier policy in the second century A.D.&quot;.

Hadrian's instrument for getting rid of the four consulars, Prefect Attianus, was made a senator and promoted to consular rank, being afterwards discarded by Hadrian, who suspected his personal ambition. It is probable that Attianus was executed (or was already dead) by the end of Hadrian's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?: ascension des élites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste à Hadrien, 27 av.

===Hadrian and the military===
Despite his own great reputation as a military administrator, Hadrian's reign was marked by a general lack of documented major military conflicts, apart from the Second Roman–Jewish War. However, disturbances on the Danubian frontier early in the reign led to the killing of the governor of Dacia, [[Caius Julius Quadratus Bassus]], to which Hadrian responded by placing the then equestrian governor of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], Q.&amp;nbsp;[[Marcius Turbo]], who had a long record of distinguished military service, as joint governor of Dacia and Pannonia Inferior with the powers of a [[Prefect]].&lt;ref&gt;András Mócsy, ''Pannonia and Upper Moesia : A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-74582-6, page 100; Leschi, Louis, &quot;La carrière de Q. Marcius Turbo, préfet du prétoire d'Hadrien&quot;.

Retrieved May 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it was decided by Hadrian that all the part of Dacia that had been added to the province of [[Moesia Inferior]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, present-day Southern [[Moldavia]] and the [[Wallachian Plain]]&lt;ref&gt;John Wacher, ed., ''The Roman World''. London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-415-26314-X, page 184&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– was to be surrendered to the [[Roxolani]] Sarmatians, whose king Rasparaganus received Roman citizenship, client king status&amp;nbsp;– and possibly an increased subsidy. The Roman partial withdrawal was probably supervised by the governor of Moesia [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 84 &amp; 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Hadrian on the Dacian front at this juncture, implied by the always unreliable ''Historia Augusta'', is merely conjectural. Hadrian did not visit Dacia in the course of his subsequent travels, but nevertheless included it into his subsequent monetary series of coins with allegories of the provinces. The notion that he contemplated the idea of withdrawing from Dacia altogether, as stated by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], appears, therefore, as unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn M. C. Toynbee, ''The Hadrianic School: A Chapter in the History of Greek Art''. CUP Archive, 1934, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian had already surrendered Trajan's conquests in [[Mesopotamia]], considering them to be indefensible. In the East, Hadrian contented himself with retaining suzerainty over [[Osroene]], which was ruled by the client king [[Parthamaspates of Parthia|Parthamaspates]], once client king of Parthia under Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, ''Empire and Conflict'', pg.67&lt;/ref&gt; There was almost a new war with Parthia around 121, but the threat was averted when Hadrian succeeded in negotiating a peace. Late in the reign (135), an invasion of the [[Alani]] in [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Capadocia]], covertly supported by the king of Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]] [[Pharasmanes II of Iberia|Pharasmanes]], was successful repulsed by Hadrian's governor, the historian [[Arrian]]&lt;ref&gt;N. J. E. Austin &amp; N. B. Rankov, ''Exploratio: Military &amp; Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople''. London: Routledge, 2002, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a  Greek intellectual and fellow student of Epictetus who had been appointed to the Senate by Hadrian and ruled Capadocia as imperial legate between 131 and 137.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter Hoyos, ed., ''A Companion to Roman Imperialism''. Leiden: Brill, 2013, ISBN 978-90-04-23593-9 , page 315&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating the Alans, Arrian subsequently installed a Roman &quot;adviser&quot; in Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;Austin &amp; Rankov, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

This abandonment of an aggressive policy was something for which the Senate and its historians never forgave Hadrian: the fourth century historian [[Aurelius Victor]] charged him with being jealous of Trajan's exploits and deliberately trying to downplay their worthiness: ''Traiani gloriae invidens''.&lt;ref&gt;W. Den Boer, ''Some Minor Roman Historians'', Leiden: Brill, 1972, ISBN 90-04-03545-1 , page 41&lt;/ref&gt; It is more probable that Hadrian simply considered that the financial strain to be incurred in keeping on a policy of conquests was something the Roman Empire could not afford: proof to it is the disappearance during his reigns of two entire legions: [[Legio XXII Deiotariana]] and the famous &quot;lost legion&quot; [[IX Hispania]], possibly destroyed during a late Trajanic uprising by the [[Brigantes]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Yann Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army''. London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-415-22295-8 , page 55&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the acknowledgement of the indefensible character of the Mesopotamian conquests had perhaps already been made by Trajan himself, who had disengaged from them at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-1-138-01920-1 , page 381&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace policy was strengthened by the erection of permanent fortifications along the empire's borders (''limites'', [[Grammatical number|sl.]] ''limes''). The most famous of these is the massive [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Great Britain]], built on stone and doubled on its rear by a [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] ([[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|''Vallum Hadriani'']]) which marked the boundary between a strictly military zone and the province.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 175; ''Hadrian's Wall AD 122-410'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, ISBN 1-84176-430-2 , page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Danube and [[Rhine]] borders were strengthened with a series of mostly wooden [[fortification]]s, forts, [[outpost (military)|outposts]] and [[watchtower (fortification)|watchtowers]], the latter specifically improving communications and local area security. These defensive activities, however, generated very few ''literary'' records: the information that it was Hadrian who built the Wall in Britain can only be found, in the entire corpus of ancient authors, in his ''Historia Augusta'' biography.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, introduction to his Eng. trans. of the first half of HA, ''Lives of the Later Caesars'', Penguin, 1982, page 13, footnote 23&lt;/ref&gt; But then, Hadrian's military activities were, in a certain measure, ideological, in that they emphasized a community of interests between all peoples living within the Roman Empire, instead a hegemony of conquest centered on the city of Rome and its Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000, ISBN 0-520-22067-6 , page 330&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain morale and prevent the troops from becoming restive, Hadrian established intensive [[Exhibition drill|drill]] routines, and personally inspected the armies. Although his coins showed military images almost as often as peaceful ones, Hadrian's policy was [[peace through strength]], even threat,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Speller, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on ''disciplina'' (discipline), which was the subject of two monetary series. This emphasis on spit and polish was heartily praised by Cassius Dio, who saw it as a useful deterrent and therefore the cause of the general peaceful character of Hadrian's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto, however, expressed other opinions on the subject: in his view, Hadrian liked to play war games and enjoyed &quot;giving eloquent speeches to the armies&quot;&amp;nbsp;– like the series of addresses, inscribed on a column, that he made while on an inspection tour during 128 at the new headquarters of [[Legio III Augusta]] in [[Lambaesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 209/212&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– rather than actual warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 211&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Fronto was very critical of Hadrian's pacifist policy, charging it with the decline in military standards of the Roman army of his own time.&lt;ref&gt;''Fronto: Selected Letters''. Edited by Caillan Davenport &amp; Jenifer Manley, London: AC &amp; Black, 2014, ISBN 978-1-78093-442-6 , pages 184/185&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, Hadrian who at least systematized the employment of the [[Numerus (Roman military unit)|''numeri'']]&amp;nbsp;– ethnic non-citizen troops with special weapons, such as Eastern mounted archers&amp;nbsp;– in low-intensity defensive tasks such as dealing with infiltrators and skirmishers.&lt;ref&gt;Luttvak, Edward N. ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979, ISBN 0-8018-2158-4, page 123&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ''numeri'' was an economic way to avoid frequent deployment of the legions, which suffered from a dearth of recruits from Italy as well as from the more Romanized provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural pursuits and patronage===
[[File:Aureus à l'effigie d'Hadrien.jpg|thumb|Hadrian on the obverse of an [[aureus]]]]
Hadrian has been described, firstly in an ancient anonymous source later echoed by Ronald Syme, among others, as the most versatile of all the Roman Emperors (''varius multiplex multiformis'').&lt;ref&gt;Ando, footnote 172. The expression comes from the anonymous ''Lybellus de vita et moribus imperatorum''&lt;/ref&gt; He also liked to demonstrate knowledge of all intellectual and artistic fields. Above all, Hadrian patronized the arts: [[Hadrian's Villa]] at Tibur ([[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]) was the greatest Roman example of an [[Alexandria]]n garden, recreating a sacred landscape, albeit lost in large part to the despoliation of the ruins by the [[Ippolito II d'Este|Cardinal d'Este]], who had much of the marble removed to build [[Villa d'Este]]. In Rome, the Pantheon, originally built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] but destroyed by fire in 80, was rebuilt under Hadrian (working on a blueprint left by Trajan: see below) in the domed form it retains to this day. It is among the best-preserved of Rome's ancient buildings and was highly influential to many of the great architects of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.

From well before his reign, Hadrian displayed a keen interest in architecture, but it seems that his eagerness was not always well received. For example, [[Apollodorus of Damascus]], famed architect of the [[Forum of Trajan]], dismissed his designs. When Trajan, predecessor to Hadrian, consulted Apollodorus about an architectural problem, Hadrian interrupted to give advice, to which Apollodorus replied, &quot;Go away and draw your pumpkins. You know nothing about these problems.&quot; &quot;Pumpkins&quot; refers to Hadrian's drawings of domes like the Serapeum in his villa. The historian Cassius Dio wrote that, once Hadrian succeeded Trajan to become emperor, he had Apollodorus exiled and later put to death. The story, however, is problematical&amp;nbsp;– archaeological evidence (brickstamps with [[Fasti|consular dates]]) has demonstrated, e.g., that the Pantheon's dome was already under construction late in Trajan's reign (115) and probably under Apollodorus's sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Vit-Suzan, ''Architectural Heritage Revisited: A Holistic Engagement of its Tangible and Intangible Constituents ''. Farnham: Ashgate, 2014, ISBN 978-1-4724-2062-6 , page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian wrote poetry in both Latin and Greek; one of the few surviving examples is a Latin poem he reportedly composed on his deathbed (see [[#Poem by Hadrian|below]]). Some of his Greek productions found their way into the [[Palatine Anthology]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Gil &amp; Sofía Torallas Tovar, ''Hadrianus''. Barcelona: CSIC, 2010, ISBN 978-84-00-09193-4 , page 100&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote an autobiography, which ''Historia Augusta'' says was published under the name of Hadrian's freedman [[Phlegon of Tralles]]. It was not, apparently, a work of great length or revelation, but designed to scotch various rumours or explain Hadrian's most controversial actions.&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Cornell, ed., ''The Fragments of the Roman Historians''. Oxford University Press: 2013, page 591&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this autobiography had the form of a series of open letters to [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', 26'&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian was a passionate hunter from the time of his youth, according to one source.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', ''Hadrian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2 2.1].&lt;/ref&gt; In northwest Asia, he founded and dedicated a city to commemorate a she-bear he killed.&lt;ref name=foxhadrian&gt;Fox, Robin ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian'' Basic Books. 2006 pg 574&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented that in Egypt he and his beloved Antinous killed a lion.&lt;ref name=foxhadrian/&gt; In Rome, eight reliefs featuring Hadrian in different stages of hunting decorate a building that began as a monument celebrating a kill.&lt;ref name=foxhadrian/&gt;

Another of Hadrian's contributions to &quot;popular&quot; culture (in fact the generalized mores of the imperial elites) was the [[beard]], which symbolised his [[philhellenism]]: [[Dio of Prusa]] had equated the generalized using of the beard with Hellenic ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of [[Scipio Africanus]] it had been fashionable among the Romans to be clean-shaven. Also, all Roman emperors before Hadrian, except for [[Nero]] (also a great admirer of Greek culture), were clean shaven. Most of the emperors after Hadrian would be portrayed with beards. Their beards, however, were not worn out of an appreciation for Greek culture but because the beard had, thanks to Hadrian, become fashionable. This new fashion lasted until the reign of [[Constantine the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=859783 |title=?|publisher=|pages=346–349|last1=Conway|first1=A. E.|volume=25|issue=138|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived again by [[Phocas]] at the start of the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/byzantine.html |title=Facts About the Byzantine Emperors |publisher=Web2.airmail.net |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding his philhellenism, however, in all other everyday life matters Hadrian behaved as a Roman civic traditionalist, who demanded the use of the [[toga]] by senators and knights in public and strict separation between the sexes in the public baths and theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Garzetti, 411&lt;/ref&gt;

As a cultural [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenophile]] Hadrian was familiar with the work of the philosophers Epictetus, Heliodorus and [[Favorinus]]. At home he attended to social needs. Hadrian mitigated slavery: masters were forbidden from killing their slaves unless allowed by a court to punish them for a grave offense.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Morabito, ''Les realités de l'esclavage d'après Le Digeste''. Paris: Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 1981, ISBN 9782251602547, page 230&lt;/ref&gt; Masters were forbidden to sell slaves to a gladiator trainer ([[lanista]]) or to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|procurer]], except as justified punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Kyle, ''Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome''. London: Routledge, 2012, ISBN 0-415-09678-2;William Linn Westermann, ''The Slave Systems of Greek and Roman Antiquity''. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1955, page 115&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian also had the legal code humanized and forbade torture of free defendants and witnesses, legislating against the common practice of condemning free persons in order to have them tortured as a means of gathering information on their supposed activities and accomplices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] 48.18.21 . Judith Perkins, ''Roman Imperial Identities in the Early Christian Era''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2009, ISBN 978-0-415-39744-5&lt;/ref&gt; He also abolished [[ergastula]], private prisons for slaves in which kidnapped free men could also be kept.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Fuhrmann, ''Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order''.Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-973784-0 ,page 102&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hadrian's humanitarian views had a limit, namely, the existence of slavery itself: confronted with a crowd that demanded the freeing of a popular slave charioteer, he replied that he could not free a slave belonging to another person.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Hadrian at least once personally engaged in cruelty toward a slave: in a fit of rage, he stabbed the eye of one of his secretaries with a pen.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium''. Harvard University Press: 1992, ISBN 0-674-39975-7, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

He built libraries, [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], baths and theaters. Hadrian is considered by many historians to have been wise and just: Schiller called him &quot;the Empire's first servant&quot;, and British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] admired his &quot;vast and active genius&quot;, as well as his &quot;equity and moderation&quot;. In 1776, he stated that Hadrian's era was part of the &quot;happiest era of human history&quot;.

While visiting Greece in 131–132, Hadrian attempted to create a kind of provincial [[parliament]] to bind all the semi-autonomous former city states across all Greece and [[Ionia]] (in [[Asia Minor]]). This parliament, known as the [[Panhellenion]], is generally conceived as a failed, albeit spirited, effort to foster cooperation among the Hellenes. However, as the German sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] remarked, the aim of the Panhellenion was probably to render Hellenism inert: to ''divert'' the feeling of a common Hellenic identity towards ideal purposes: &quot;games, commemorations, preservation of an ideal, an entirely non-political Hellenism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Sociology: Inquiries into the Construction of Social Forms''. Leiden: Brill, 2009, ISBN 978-90-04-17321-7 , page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian died at his villa in Baiae. He was buried in a [[mausoleum]] on the western bank of the [[Tiber]], in Rome, a building later transformed into a papal fortress, Castel Sant'Angelo. The dimensions of his mausoleum, in its original form, were deliberately designed to be slightly larger than the earlier [[Mausoleum of Augustus]].

According to Cassius Dio, a gigantic equestrian statue was erected to Hadrian after his death. &quot;It was so large that the bulkiest man could walk through the eye of each horse, yet because of the extreme height of the foundation persons passing along on the ground below believe that the horses themselves as well as Hadrian are very very small.&quot; This may refer to the huge statuary group placed atop the mausoleum, which disappeared at some later time, depicting Hadrian driving a four-horse [[quadriga]] chariot.

==Hadrian's travels==

===Purpose===
The most distinctive aspect of Hadrian's reign was the fact that the Emperor was to spend more than half of it outside of Italy and engaged in peaceful pursuits. Obviously, other emperors had often left Rome for long periods, but then mostly to go to war, returning soon after conflicts concluded. A previous emperor, Nero, once travelled through Greece and was condemned for his self-indulgence. According to modern historians such as [[Paul Veyne]], what Hadrian intended by his incessant travelling was what Nero had failed to achieve: to break with the sedentary (''casanière'') tradition of previous emperors, who saw the Empire as a purely Roman hegemony; instead, Hadrian sought to make his subjects feel part of a commonwealth of civilized peoples, sharing a common Hellenic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''Le Pain et le Cirque'', Paris: Seuil, 1976, ISBN 2-02-004507-9 , page 655&lt;/ref&gt; That is why Hadrian, in a speech to the Senate preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]], supported the creation of new [[Municipium|municipia]], autonomous urban communities with their own customs and laws, over the creation of new [[Roman colony|colonies]], urban communities with a standard Roman constitution.&lt;ref&gt;András Mócsy, ''Pannonia and Upper Moesia (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire''. Routledge: 2014,&lt;/ref&gt;

All this did not go well with Roman traditionalism: as far as the ''Historia Augusta'' portrays traditional ideology, Hadrian was regarded by its author as &quot;a little too much Greek&quot;, far more cosmopolitan than it was thought fit for a Roman emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Goldhill, ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire''. Cambridge University Press: 2006,ISBN 0-521-66317-2 , page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Hadrian's travels as a means of stressing the cosmopolitan, ecumenical character of the Roman Empire was confirmed late during the reign when Hadrian struck a series of special issue coins representing allegories of the various provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, &quot; ''Humanitas'': Romans and non-Romans&quot;. In Andrea Giardina, ed., ''The Romans'', University of Chicago Press: 1993, ISBN 0-226-29049-2 , page 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian traveled as an integral part of his governing, something he made clear to the Roman Senate and the people. In order to check the Roman populace, he made recourse to his chief equestrian adviser, Marcius Turbo, who was made Pretorian Prefect in 121&amp;nbsp;– while he was still joint-governor of Dacia and Pannonia Inferior&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 91&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and who had as his task to adjudicate non-senators. Turbo had had a long career as a [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]],&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 158&lt;/ref&gt; and was regarded as one of the leading men of the equestrian order.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Saller, ''Personal Patronage Under the Early Empire''. Cambridge University Press: 2002, ISBN 0-521-23300-3 , page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was not qualified to keep a check on the Senate, as Hadrian forbade equestrians to try cases against senators.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Crime and Punishment in Ancient Rome''. London: Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-203-42858-7 , page 83&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate had ultimate legal authority over its members, as it remained formally the highest court of appeal, from which appealing to the Emperor was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], 49 2,I,2 , quoted by P.E. Corbett, &quot;The Legislation of Hadrian&quot;. ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register'',  Vol. 74, No. 8 (Jun., 1926), pp. 753-766&lt;/ref&gt; There are hints within certain sources that Hadrian also employed a [[secret police]] force, the [[frumentarii]], on an ad hoc, occasional basis&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Fuhrmann, ''Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order''. Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-973784-0 , page 153&lt;/ref&gt; to snoop primarily on people of high social standing, such as his close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Mary Sheldon, ''Intelligence Activities in Ancient Rome: Trust in the Gods But Verify''. London: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-714-65480-9 , page 253&lt;/ref&gt;

His visits were marked by handouts which often contained instructions for the construction of new public buildings. His intention was to strengthen the Empire from within through improved infrastructure, as opposed to conquering or annexing perceived enemies. This was often the purpose of his journeys; commissioning new structures, projects and settlements. His almost evangelical belief in Greek culture strengthened his views: like many emperors before him, Hadrian's will was almost always obeyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Speller, pp. 74–81&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Speller, pp. 74–81&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Greek rhetorician [[Aelius Aristides]] was to extol his activities by writing that he &quot;extended over his subjects a protecting hand, raising them as one helps fallen men on their feet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christol &amp; Nony, 159&quot;&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

His travelling court was large, including administrators and probably also [[architect]]s and [[Construction worker|builders]]. The burden on the areas he passed through was sometimes great. While his arrival usually brought some benefits, it is possible that those who had to bear the burden were of a different class from those who reaped the benefits. For example, huge amounts of provisions were requisitioned during his visit to Egypt; this suggests that the burden on the mainly [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] must have been intolerable, causing some measure of [[starvation]] and hardship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Speller, pp. 74–81&quot;/&gt;

At the same time, as in later times all the way through the European Renaissance, kings were welcomed into their cities or lands, and the financial burden was completely on them, and only indirectly on the poorer class. Hadrian's first tour came just four years after assuming the office of Caesar, when he sought a cure for a skin disease thought to be leprosy and travelled to [[Judea]] [[Roman province]] while en route to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Treatise on Weights and Measures''&amp;nbsp;– Syriac Version (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press, c1935, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; This time also allowed him the freedom to concern himself with his general cultural aims. At some point, he travelled north, towards [[Germania]] and inspected the Rhine–Danube frontier, allocating funds to improve the defences. However, it was a voyage to the Empire's very frontiers that represented perhaps his most significant visit; upon hearing of a recent revolt, he journeyed to Britannia.

===Britannia and the West (122)===
[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|[[Hadrian's Wall]] (Vallum Hadriani), a fortification in Northern England (viewed from [[Vercovicium]]).]]
[[File:Hadrian Kapısı (4).JPG|thumb|[[Hadrian's Gate]], in Antalya, southern Turkey was built to honour Hadrian who visited the city in 130.]]
Prior to Hadrian's arrival in Britain, there had been a major rebellion in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] from 119 to 121.&lt;ref&gt;Birley 123&lt;/ref&gt; Although operations in Britannia at the time got no mention worthy of note in the literary sources, inscriptions tell of an ''expeditio Britannica'' involving major troop movements, including sending a [[vexillatio]] (i.e., a detachment) of some 3,000 men taken from legions stationed on the Rhine and in Spain; Fronto writes about military losses in Britannia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, 79&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia Augusta'' notes that the Britons could not be kept under Roman control; Pompeius Falco was sent to Britain to restore order, and coins of 119–120 refer to this. In 122 Hadrian initiated the construction of Hadrian's Wall. The wall was built &quot;to separate Romans from barbarians&quot;, according to the ''Historia Augusta''.&lt;ref&gt;''Scriptores Historiae Augustae'', Hadrian, xi, 2&lt;/ref&gt; It deterred attacks on Roman territory (at a lower cost than a massed border army)&lt;ref&gt;Patrick le&amp;nbsp;Roux, ''Le haut-Empire romain en Occident d'Auguste aux Sévères''. Paris: Seuil, 1998, ISBN 2-02-025932-X, page 396&lt;/ref&gt; and controlled cross-border trade and immigration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breeze&quot;&gt;Breeze, David J., and Brian Dobson, &quot;Hadrian's Wall: Some Problems&quot;, ''Britannia'', Vol. 3, (1972), pp. 182–208&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Limes Germanicus|Germanic limes]], built of wood palisades, Hadrian's Wall was primarily a stone construction.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 131–3&lt;/ref&gt; The western third of the wall, from modern-day [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to the [[River Irthing]], was originally built of turf for unknown reasons. Possibly to hasten its construction, the wall's width was narrowed in some sections from the original planned 12&amp;nbsp;feet to 7. The turf wall was, however, later rebuilt in stone, and a large ditch with adjoining mounds, known today as the Vallum, was dug to the south of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Breeze and Dobson (2000) pp. 15–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hadrian, a shrine was erected in [[York]] to Britain as a goddess, and coins that introduced a female figure as the [[National personification|personification of Britain]], labelled &lt;small&gt;[[BRITANNIA]]&lt;/small&gt;, were struck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins|publisher=Chard|accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 122, Hadrian had concluded his visit to Britannia, and from there headed south to [[Mauretania]], never to return. Thus he never saw the finished wall that bears his name.

Hadrian appears to have gone to Mauretania through southern Gaul, and it is probable that he visited [[Nîmes|Nemausus]], where he may have overseen the building of a [[basilica]] dedicated to Plotina, who had meanwhile died in Rome. Plotina was in due course deified at Hadrian's prompting.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 145&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before her death, Hadrian had already granted Plotina a signal favour, by stating that succession to the head of the [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] School in Athens could be granted to a non-Roman citizen&amp;nbsp;– a petition that had been made by the incumbent head of the school seeking Plotina's intercession.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 108/109&lt;/ref&gt; Matidia Augusta, Hadrian's mother-in-law, had died earlier, in December 119, and had also been deified.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 107&lt;/ref&gt; Both deifications of these prominent female members of Trajan's family might be seen as an effort by Hadrian to buttress his legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Joseph Kreitzer, ''Striking New Images: Roman Imperial Coinage and the New Testament World''. Sheffield: A &amp; C Black, 1996, ISBN 1-85075-623-6, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; At what appears to have been the same time, Hadrian dismissed his secretary in charge of his official correspondence (''ab epistulis''), the historian [[Suetonius]], for &quot;excessive familiarity&quot; towards the empress.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König, Katerina Oikonomopoulou, Greg Woolf, eds. ''Ancient Libraries''. Cambridge U. Press: 2013, ISBN 978-1-107-01256-1, page 251&lt;/ref&gt; Also dismissed for the same alleged reason was Marcius Turbo's colleague as Praetorian Prefect, [[Gaius Septicius Clarus]]. Given Clarus' high office, the alleged reason for his dismissal could have been merely a pretext to remove him from office.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Everitt, ''Hadrian and the triumph of Rome''. New York: Random House, 2009, ISBN 978-1-4000-6662-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian spent the winter of 122/123 at Spain, in [[Tarraco]], where he restored the Temple of [[Augustus]] before crossing the Mediterranean into Mauretania.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Mierse, ''Temples and Towns in Roman Iberia: The Social and Architectural Dynamics of Sanctuary Designs from the Third Century B.C. to the Third Century A.D.''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, ISBN 0-520-20377-1 , page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa, Parthia and Anatolia; Antinous (123–124)===
In 123, he arrived in [[Mauretania]] where he personally led a campaign against local rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Royston Lambert, pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt; However, this visit was to be short, as reports came through that the Eastern nation of Parthia was again preparing for war; as a result, Hadrian quickly headed eastwards. On his journey east it is known that at some point he visited [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], during which time he personally made available funds for the training of the young men of well-bred families for the Roman military. Cyrene had already benefited from his generosity: in 119 he had provided funds for the rebuilding of public buildings destroyed in the recent Jewish revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 151–2&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding lasted until late in the reign, and in 138 a statue of [[Zeus]] was erected with a dedication to Hadrian as &quot;saviour and founder&quot; of Cyrene.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule from Pompey to Diocletian : a Study in Political Relations''. Leiden, Brill, 2001, 0-391-04155-X , page 410&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hadrian arrived on the [[Euphrates]], he characteristically solved the problem through a negotiated settlement with the Parthian king [[Osroes I]]. He then proceeded to check the Roman defences before setting off west along the coast of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 153–5&lt;/ref&gt; He probably spent the winter in [[Nicomedia]], the main city of [[Bithynia]]. As Nicomedia had been hit by an earthquake only shortly prior to his stay, Hadrian was generous in providing funds for rebuilding, for which he was acclaimed as the chief restorer of the province as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley, pp. 157–8&quot;&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 157–8&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Hadrian visited [[Claudiopolis (Bithynia)|Claudiopolis]] and there espied the beautiful Antinous, a young boy who was destined to become the emperor's [[Intimate relationship|beloved]]. Sources say nothing about when Hadrian met Antinous; however, there are depictions of Antinous that show him as a young man of 20 or so. As this was shortly before Antinous's death in 130 (the earliest date for which we can be sure of Antinous' being together with Hadrian) Antinous in 123 would most likely have been a youth of 13 or 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley, pp. 157–8&quot;/&gt; It is possible that Antinous was sent to Rome to be trained as a [[page (occupation)|page]] to serve the emperor and only gradually rose to the status of imperial favourite.&lt;ref&gt;Royston Lambert, pp. 60–1&lt;/ref&gt; The fact is, however, that the actual history of the Antinous/Hadrian relationship is mostly unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', 171&lt;/ref&gt;

With or without Antinous, Hadrian travelled through [[Anatolia]]. The route he took is uncertain. Various incidents are described, such as his founding of a city within Mysia, Hadrianutherae, after a successful boar hunt. (The building of the city was probably more than a mere whim&amp;nbsp;– sparsely populated wooded areas such as the location of the new city were already ripe for development). Some historians dispute whether Hadrian did in fact commission the city's construction at all. At about this time, plans to complete the Temple of Zeus in [[Cyzicus]], begun by the kings of [[Attalid dynasty|Pergamon]], were put into practice. The temple, whose completion had been contemplated by Trajan, received a colossal statue of Hadrian, and was built with dazzling white marble with gold thread. Cyzicus received the additional honor of being declared a regional center for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] ([[neocorate|''neocoros'']]), sharing it with [[Pergamon]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Sardes]]&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 164–7&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– something that offered the benefits of Imperial sponsorship of sacred games, attracting tourism and stimulating private expenditure as well as channeling intercity rivalry into a common acceptance of Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Boatwrtight, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece (124–125)===

[[File:Pantheon Agrippa.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] was rebuilt by Hadrian.]]

The climax of this tour was the destination that Hadrian must have had in mind all along, Greece. He arrived in the autumn of 124 in time to participate in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. By tradition, at one stage in the ceremony the initiates were supposed to carry arms; but, this was waived to avoid any risk to the emperor. At the Athenians' request, he conducted a revision of their constitution&amp;nbsp;– among other things, a new [[phyle]] (tribe) was added bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 175–7&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a system of coercive purchases of [[Olive oil|oil]] was imposed on Athenian producers in order to ensure an adequate supply of the commodity; management of the system was left in the hands of the local [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Assembly]] and [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Council]], appeals to the Emperor notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Kaja Harter-Uibopuu, &quot;Hadrian and the Athenian Oil Law&quot;, IN O.M.

Review of Graindor (Paul). ''Athènes sous Hadrien'', ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 1935, vol.&amp;nbsp;14, n°&amp;nbsp;3, pp.&amp;nbsp;926–931.

Retrieved June 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, however, Hadrian preferred that civic expenditure by Greek notables should concentrate on buildings rather than on spectacles and competitions: in a letter to [[Aphrodisias]] he praised a requirement that high priests of the imperial cult donate funds to works on an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] rather than to gladiatorial games.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Golden, ''Greek Sport and Social Status''.University of Texas Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-292-71869-2, page  88&lt;/ref&gt; Such aqueducts&amp;nbsp;– associated with public fountains&amp;nbsp;– [[Nymphaeum|''nymphaea'']]&amp;nbsp;– were one of Hadrian's additions to the Greek urban landscape: besides Athens, where two such fountains were built, Argos also received a similar project.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Kosso, Anne Scott, eds., ''The Nature and Function of Water, Baths, Bathing, and Hygiene from Antiquity Through the Renaissance''. Leiden: Brill, 2009, ISBN 978-90-04-17357-6 , pages 216/217&lt;/ref&gt;

It was possibly at this time that Hadrian received, according to [[Eusebius]], an apology (i.e., a defense) of the Christian faith made by two Christians, Quadratus and Aristides. Apparently, Hadrian simply kept to Trajan's policy of passive tolerance, by which Christians should not be sought after but sentenced only after due trial.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 127 and 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[rescript]] addressed to the proconsul of Asia Minutius Fundanus and preserved by [[Justin Martyr]], Hadrian laid down that accusers of Christians had to bear the burden of proof for their denunciations&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Galimberti, &quot;Hadrian, Eleusis, and the beginnings of Christian apologetics&quot; IN Marco Rizzi,ed., ''Hadrian and the Christians''.

During the winter he toured the [[Peloponnese]]. His exact route is uncertain; however, Pausanias reports of tell-tale signs, such as temples built by Hadrian and the statue of the emperor&amp;nbsp;– in [[heroic nudity]]&amp;nbsp;– built by the grateful citizens of [[Epidaurus]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexia Petsalis-Diomidis, ''Truly Beyond Wonders: Aelius Aristides and the Cult of Asklepios''. OUP : 2010, ISBN 978-0-19-956190-2 , page 171&lt;/ref&gt; in thanks to their &quot;restorer&quot;. He was especially generous to [[Mantinea]], where he restored the Temple of [[Poseidon|Poseidon Hippios]]; this supports the theory that Antinous was in fact already Hadrian's lover because of the strong link between Mantinea and Antinous's home in Bithynia.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 177–80&lt;/ref&gt; However, as this kinship between Mantinea and Bythinia was itself a mythological fiction of the kind used at the time for encouraging political alliances between polities, a more serious reason might exist for Hadrian's particular generosity.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter,''The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180–395''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-84054-5 , page 44&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian's buildings in Greece were no mere whims, as they followed a pattern of favoring old religious centers: besides the temple at Mantinea, Hadrian restored other ancient shrines in [[Abae]], [[Argos]]&amp;nbsp;– where he restored the [[Heraion of Argos|Heraion]]&amp;nbsp;– and [[Megara]].&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, 134&lt;/ref&gt; This was a way of gathering legitimacy to Roman imperial rule by associating it to the glories of classical Greece&amp;nbsp;– something well in line with contemporary antiquarian taste in cultural matters.&lt;ref&gt;K. W. Arafat, ''Pausanias' Greece: Ancient Artists and Roman Rulers''. Cambridge U. Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-55340-7 , page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian is credited by Pausanias with restoring to Mantinea its ancient, classical name: it had been named Antigoneia since Hellenistic times, in honor of the Macedonian king [[Antigonus III Doson]].&lt;ref&gt;K. W. Arafat, 185&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This same idea of resurrecting the classical past under Roman overlordship was behind the possibility that, during his tour of the Peloponnese, Hadrian persuaded the [[Sparta]]n grandee Eurycles Herculanus&amp;nbsp;– the contemporary leader of the [[Euryclids|Euryclid]] family that had ruled Sparta since Augustus' day&amp;nbsp;– to enter the Senate, alongside the Athenian grandee [[Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes (suffect consul 133)|Herodes Atticus the Elder]]. The two aristocrats would be the first Greeks from Old Greece to enter the Roman Senate, as &quot;representatives&quot; of the two &quot;great powers&quot; of the Classical Age.&lt;ref&gt;ANTHONY R. BIRLEY, &quot;HADRIAN AND GREEK SENATORS&quot;, '' Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 116 (1997) 209–245. Available at [http://uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/116pdf/116209.pdf]. Retrieved July 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important step in overcoming Greek notables' haughty disdain and their reluctance to take part in Roman political life.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 125, Hadrian had reached [[Athens]], presiding over the festival of [[Dionysia]]. The building program that Hadrian initiated was substantial. Various rulers had done work on building the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] over a timespan of more than five centuries&amp;nbsp;– it was Hadrian and the vast resources he could command that ensured that the job would be finished. He also initiated the construction of several public buildings on his own whim and even organized the building of an aqueduct.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 182–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Italy and trip to Africa (126–128)===
On his return to Italy, Hadrian made a detour to [[Sicily]]. Coins celebrate him as the restorer of the island, though there is no record of what he did to earn this accolade.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Rome, he was able to see for himself the completed work of rebuilding the Pantheon. Also completed by then was Hadrian's villa nearby at [[Tibur]], a pleasant retreat by the [[Sabine Hills]] for whenever Rome became too much for him. At the beginning of March 127 Hadrian set off for a tour of Italy. Once again, historians are able to reconstruct his route by evidence of his hand-outs rather than the historical records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley, pp. 191–200&quot;&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 191–200&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in that year he restored the Picentine earth goddess [[Cupra]] in the town of [[Cupra Maritima]]. At some unspecified time he improved the drainage of the [[Fucine lake]]. Less welcome than such largesse was his decision in 127 to divide Italy into four regions under imperial legates with consular rank, who had jurisdiction over all of Italy excluding Rome itself, therefore shifting cases from the courts of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;J. Declareuil, ''Rome the Law-Giver'', London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-415-15613-0, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, the four consulars acted as governors of the regions assigned to them. Having Italy effectively reduced to the status of a group of mere provinces did not go down well with Italian hegemonic feelings (especially with the Roman Senate),&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000, ISBN 978-0-520-22067-6&lt;/ref&gt; and this innovation did not long outlive Hadrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley, pp. 191–200&quot;/&gt;

Hadrian fell ill around this time, though the nature of his sickness is not known. Whatever the illness was, it did not stop him from setting off in the spring of 128 to visit Africa. His arrival began with the good omen of rain ending a [[drought]]. Along with his usual role as benefactor and restorer, he found time to inspect the troops; his speech to the troops survives to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Royston Lambert, pp. 71–2&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian returned to Italy in the summer of 128 but his stay was brief, as he set off on another tour that would last three years.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 213–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece, Asia, and Egypt (128–130); Antinous' death===

In September 128, Hadrian again attended the Eleusinian mysteries. This time his visit to Greece seems to have concentrated on Athens and [[Sparta]]&amp;nbsp;– the two ancient rivals for dominance of Greece. Hadrian had played with the idea of focusing his Greek revival around the [[Amphictyonic League]] based in Delphi, but by now he had decided on something far grander. His new Panhellenion was going to be a council that would bring Greek cities together. The meeting place was to be the new temple to Zeus in Athens. Having set in motion the preparations&amp;nbsp;– deciding whose claim to be a Greek city was genuine would in itself take time&amp;nbsp;– Hadrian set off for Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 215–20&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the &quot;Greek city&quot;, however, was mostly political and mythological rather than historical: it involved fabricated claims to Greek origins and imperial favour.&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, 150&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, it linked appreciation of an idealized cultural Hellenism with loyalty to Rome and her Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kaldellis, ''Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical Tradition''Cambridge U. Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-521-87688-9 , page 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Panhellenion was devised with a view to associating the Roman Emperor with protection of Greek culture and of the &quot;liberties&quot; of Greece&amp;nbsp;– in the case, urban self-government. It allowed Hadrian to appear as the fictive heir to [[Pericles]], who supposedly had convened a previous Panhellenic Congress&amp;nbsp;– which is mentioned, by the way, only in his [[Parallel Lives|biography]] by [[Plutarch]], whose sympathies to the Imperial order are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando A. Marín Valdés, ''Plutarco y el arte de la Atenas hegemónica''. Universidad de Oviedo: 2008, ISBN 978-84-8317-659-7 , page 76&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphical evidence suggests, however, that the prospect of &quot;applying&quot; to the Panhellenion raised less interest in the wealthier cities from Asia Minor, which were jealous of Athenian and European Greek preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. S. Spawforth, ''Greece and the Augustan Cultural Revolution''. Cambridge University Press: 2011, ISBN 978-1-107-01211-0 , page 262&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian defined Hellenism in a narrow, archaizing manner: no Hellenistic foundations were admitted into the Panhellenion, as Hadrian defined &quot;Greekness&quot; in terms of classical roots alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanael J. Andrade, ''Syrian Identity in the Greco-Roman World''. Cambridge University Press, 2013, ISBN 978-1-107-01205-9 , page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

From Greece, Hadrian proceeded by way of Asia to Egypt. It is known from an inscription that he was at the time probably conveyed across the Aegean with his entourage by one Ephesian, Lucius Erastus, on behalf of whom he later sent a letter to the Council of Ephesus, stating that Erastus wanted to become a town councillor, and that he, Hadrian, was willing to pay the honorary sum required for entrance in the council, if the Ephesians regarded Erastus (who, as a merchant, was probably snubbed upon as unfit for civic prominence) worthy to fill such a position.&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, Hadrian opened his stay by restoring [[Pompey the Great]]'s tomb at [[Pelusium]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 235&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian also offered sacrifice to Pompey as a [[hero]] and composed an [[epigram]] for the tomb. As Pompey was universally acknowledged as the conqueror of the Roman East, this restoration was probably linked to a need to reaffirm Roman Eastern hegemony after the recent disturbances there during Trajan's late reign.&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, 142&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Egypt, a poem about a lion hunt in the Libyan desert by the Greek Pankrates witnesses for the first time that Antinous travelled alongside Hadrian.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', 173&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 130, while Hadrian and his entourage were sailing on the [[Nile]], Antinous drowned for unknown reasons; accident, suicide, murder and religious sacrifice have all been postulated. ''Historia Augusta'' offers the following account:
{{quote|text=During a journey on the Nile he lost Antinous, his favourite, and for this youth he wept like a woman. Concerning this incident there are varying rumours; for some claim that he had devoted himself to death for Hadrian, and others&amp;nbsp;– what both his beauty and Hadrian's sensuality suggest. But however this may be, the Greeks deified him at Hadrian's request, and declared that oracles were given through his agency, but these, it is commonly asserted, were composed by Hadrian himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' (c.&amp;nbsp;395) Hadr. 14.5–7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was at that time that Hadrian turned, by his personal initiative, the ''persona'' of Antinous&amp;nbsp;– a low-status non-citizen Greek&amp;nbsp;– into something far surpassing the usual imperial boy favourite and sexual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, 170/174&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply saddened, Hadrian founded the Egyptian city of [[Antinopolis]] in his memory, and had Antinous deified&amp;nbsp;– an unprecedented honour for one not of the ruling family.

Although Hadrian was criticized for the intensity of his grief to Antinous's death, his attempt at turning the deceased youth into a cult-figure found little opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Williams , ''Roman Homosexuality : Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity''. Oxford University Press: 1999, ISBN 9780195113006, pages 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of Antinous was to become very popular in the Greek-speaking world.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor&quot;&gt;&quot;Antinous's mysterious death in the Nile led to a Graeco-Egyptian hero-cult to surpass all others in the Greek-speaking world, and busts of the young man are now among the most common from antiquity.&quot; (MacGregor, Neil, &quot;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4353046.ece There’s more to Hadrian than wall-building]&quot;, ''Times'' of London, 6&amp;nbsp;July 2008.&lt;br /&gt;Dyson, Stephen L., ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Hadrian created the cult as a political move to reconcile the Greek-speaking East to Roman rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Januszczak&quot;&gt;&quot;The public taking of Antinous the Greek as a lover makes more sense as a deliberate political manoeuvre designed to ingratiate himself with the Greek-speakers who still made up 50% of the empire.&quot; (Januszczak, Waldemar, &quot;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4353046.ece Hadrian – Empire and Conflict at the British Museum]&quot;, ''Times'' of London, 20 July 2008)&lt;br&gt;Lambert, ''op. cit.'' p.&amp;nbsp;185.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a copy, in Hadrian's villa, of the famous statue pair of the [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|Tyrannicides]], with a bearded Aristogeiton and a clean-shaven Harmodios, in a certain way linked the imperial favourite to the classical tradition of [[Greek love]]&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 176/177&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to usual Roman distrust of [[Greek pederasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Chad Denton, ''The War on Sex: Western Repression from the Torah to Victoria''. McFarland: 2014, ISBN 978-0-7864-9504-7, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy and the West, the cult also found supporters: in one inscription from Tivoli, Antinous was compared to the Celtic sun-god [[Belenos]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Medals were struck with Antinous' effigy, and statues erected to him in all parts of the empire, in all kinds of garb, including Egyptian dress.&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner, ''Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph'', ''Oxford History of Art'', Oxford U.P., 1998, ISBN 0-19-284201-3, pages 183/184.&lt;/ref&gt; Temples were built for his worship in Bithynia and Mantineia in Arcadia. In Athens, festivals were celebrated in his honour and oracles delivered in his name. The site chosen for the city of Antinopolis (or Antinoe) was on the ruins of [[Besa (city)|Besa]], in the vicinity of Antinous's death-place.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, LIX.11; ''Historia Augusta'', ''Hadrian''&lt;/ref&gt; The city was a proper Greek [[polis]], which, however, besides benefitting from an alimentary scheme similar to Trajan's [[alimenta]],&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cornell, Dr Kathryn Lomas, eds., ''Bread and Circuses: Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy''. London: Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-415-14689-5 , page 97&lt;/ref&gt; also allowed its citizens the privilege of marrying members of the native population without disenfranchising themselves&amp;nbsp;– proof that Hadrian intended, again, to use a local religious cult (in this case, an Egyptianized one) as a means of integrating native populations into the celebration of Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl F. Petry, ed. ''The Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume 1''. Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-521-47137-4 , page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Antinous's cult differed from the previous imperial cult in that, instead of centering on worshipping the Emperor as a ruler, it involved the Emperor ''as well as his subjects'' in a common religious activity, thereby emphasizing a sense of shared community.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Rizzi, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, it was very successful. As an &quot;international&quot; cult figure, Antinous had an enduring fame, far outlasting Hadrian's reign: local coins with his effigy were still being struck during [[Caracalla]]'s reign, and he was invoked in a poem to celebrate the accession of [[Diocletian]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Vout, ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome''. Cambridge University Press; 2007, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece and the East; return to Rome (130–133) ===
Hadrian’s movements subsequent to the founding of Antinopolis on 30 October 130 are obscure. Whether or not he returned to Rome, he traveled in the East during 130/131 (see below) and spent the winter of 131–32 in Athens, where he dedicated the Olympeion,&lt;ref&gt;Laura Salah Nasrallah, ''Christian Responses to Roman Art and Architecture: The Second-Century Church Amid the Spaces of Empire''. Cambridge University Press, 2010 ISBN 978-0-521-76652-4 , page 96&lt;/ref&gt; and probably remained in Greece or went East because of the Jewish rebellion which broke out in Judaea in 132 (see below). Inscriptions make it clear that he took the field in person against the rebels with his army in 133; he then returned to Rome, probably in that year and almost certainly&amp;nbsp;– again, judging from inscriptions&amp;nbsp;– via [[Illyria|Illyricum]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, &quot;Journeys of Hadrian&quot; (1988), pp. 164–9&lt;/ref&gt; This third and final trip to the Greek East produced much religious enthusiasm in the region centered around Hadrian, who received a personal cult as a deity and numerous monuments and civic homages, according to the religious [[syncretism]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Le Glay. &quot;Hadrien et l'Asklépieion de Pergame&quot;.

===Legal reforms and State apparatus===

It was around that time that Hadrian enacted, through the jurist [[Salvius Julianus]], what was to become the first attempt to codify Roman law: the [[Praetor's Edict|Perpetual Edict]], according to which the various forms of legal action introduced yearly by [[pretor]]s were to remain fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Jansen, ''The Roman Paratext: Frame, Texts, Readers''. Cambridge University Press: 2014, ISBN 978-1-107-02436-6 , page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The practical meaning of this measure was that a law could no longer be changed by a magistrate's personal interpretation of it; the law had become a fixed statute, which only the Emperor could alter.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kuiper, ed., ''Ancient Rome: From Romulus and Remus to the Visigoth Invasion''.New York: Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010, ISBN 978-1-61530-207-9 , page 133&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, following a procedure initiated by [[Domitian]], Hadrian professionalized the Emperor's legal advisory board, the Prince's Counsel or ''consilia principis'', which became a permanent body staffed by salaried legal aides.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arthur Schiller, ''Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development''. Walter de Gruyter: 1978, ISBN 90-279-7744-5 , page 471&lt;/ref&gt; By so doing, Hadrian developed a professional bureaucracy, consisting mainly of equestrians and replacing the earlier freedmen of the Imperial household,&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, 812&quot;&gt;Salmon, 812&lt;/ref&gt; that was to control the political field instead of the Senate's individual members,&lt;ref&gt;R.V. Nind Hopkins, ''Life of Alexander Severus'', CUP Archive, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation that marked the superseding of surviving Republican institutions by an openly autocratic political system.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, Volume 43''. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1968 , ISBN 0-87169-435-2 ,page 650&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian's bureaucracy was supposed to carry out the administrative functions not earlier exercised by the old magistrates, and therefore objectively it did not detract from the Senate's position: the new civil servants were free men and as such supposed to act on behalf of the interests of the &quot;Crown&quot;, not of the Emperor as an individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, 812&quot;/&gt; However, the Senate never accepted the loss of its prestige caused by the emergence of a new aristocracy alongside it, placing additional strain on the already troubled relationship between the Senate and the Emperor that was to be a hallmark of the end of Hadrian's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, 813&lt;/ref&gt;

In 130/131, Hadrian toured the East, bestowing honorific titles on many regional centers.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanael J. Andrade, ''Syrian Identity in the Greco-Roman World'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, ISBN 978-1-107-01205-9 , page 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palmyra]] received a state visit and was given the civic name Hadriana Palmyra.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Smith II, ''Roman Palmyra: Identity, Community, and State Formation''. Oxford University Press: 2013, ISBN 978-0-19-986110-1 , page 25; Robert K. Sherk, ''The Roman Empire: Augustus to Hadrian''. Cambridge University Press:1988, ISBN 0-521-33887-5, page 190&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian also bestowed honors on various Palmyrene magnates, among them one Soados, who lived in the Parthian city of Vologesias and, as a go-between, had done much to protect Palmyrene trade between the Roman Empire and Parthia.&lt;ref&gt;Hadrien Bru, ''Le pouvoir impérial dans les provinces syriennes: Représentations et célébrations d'Auguste à Constantin (31 av. J.-C.-337 ap. J.-C.)''. Leiden: Brill,2011, ISBN 978-90-04-20363-1, pages 104/105&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then that Hadrian visited the ruins of [[Jerusalem]], in [[Roman Judaea]], left after the [[First Roman–Jewish War]] of 66–73. According to a [[midrash]]ic tradition, he first showed himself sympathetic to the Jews, allegedly planning to have the city rebuilt and allowing the [[Third Temple#Bar Kochba revolt|rebuilding of the Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;Yeshayahu Gafni, ''Jerusalem to Jabneh, Units 1-2'', Tel-Aviv: Open University of Israel, 1980, ISBN 978-965-06-1190-3 , page 28&lt;/ref&gt; but when told by [[Samaritans]] that it would be the catalyst for sedition, he changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabba, Genesis Rabba 64 (end)&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of this tradition is, however, doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Simonsohn, ''The Jews of Italy: Antiquity''. Leiden;Brill, 2014, ISBN 978-90-04-28235-3, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; The account stands in sharp contradiction to an alternate tradition that has Hadrian deciding to build a temple to the Roman god Jupiter on the ruins of the Temple Mount&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman history 69.12.1&lt;/ref&gt; and other temples to various Roman gods throughout Jerusalem, including a large temple to the [[goddess]] [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerusalem 1981&quot;&gt;[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to modern scholar Giovanni Bazzana, Hadrian's original intention may have been to rebuild Jerusalem as a [[Roman colony]]&amp;nbsp;– such as [[Vespasian]] had done earlier to [[Caesarea Maritima]]&amp;nbsp;– with various honorific and fiscal privileges, as well as a pagan population. It is accepted that the usual Roman policy in other colonies involved exempting the Jewish population from participating in Roman religious rituals. What was demanded from Jewish communities was political support to the Roman imperial order, as attested in Caesarea, where epigraphy attests that some of its Jewish citizens served in the Roman army during both the 66 and 132 rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Bazzana, &quot;The Bar Kokhba Revolt and Hadrian's religious policy&quot;, IN Marco Rizzi,ed., '' Hadrian and the Christians''. Berlim: De Gruyter, 2010, ISBN 978-3-11-022470-2 , pages 89/91&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that Hadrian intended to assimilate the Jewish Temple into the civic-religious basis of support to his reign, as he had been doing with Greek and other traditional places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Bazzana, 98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a basis of support for his autocratic legitimacy&amp;nbsp;– a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as [[Philo]].&lt;ref&gt;Rizzi, ''Hadrian and the Christians'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenization and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Friedheim, &quot;Some notes about the Samaritans and the Rabbinic Class at Crossroads&quot; IN Menachem Mor,Friedrich V. Reiterer, eds., '' Samaritans&amp;nbsp;– Past and Present: Current Studies''. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2010, ISBN 978-3-11-019497-5 , page 197&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenized Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of the Jewish revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos (&quot;Highest&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Ken Dowden, ''Zeus''.

Cambridge University Press: 2013 , ISBN 978-1-107-04344-2, pages 248/249&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt at conciliation between Judaism and Hellenism, however, foundered when faced with strict Jewish monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Mazza, &quot;A rosy lotus for Antinoos.

Tübingen 1981, pages 29–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for this failure to integrate Judaism into a unified religious system lies in the fact that, after the war, Hadrian even renamed Jerusalem itself, as [[Aelia Capitolina]] after himself and [[Jupiter Capitolinus]], the chief Roman deity. According to Epiphanius, Hadrian appointed [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila from Sinope]] in Pontus as &quot;overseer of the work of building the city&quot;, seeing that Aquila was related to him by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Treatise on Weights and Measures'' – Syriac Version (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press, c1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian is said to have placed the city's main [[Roman Forum|Forum]] at the junction of the main [[Cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus]], now the location for the (smaller) [[Muristan]].

A tradition based on the ''Historia Augusta'' suggests that tensions grew higher when Hadrian abolished [[History of male circumcision#Male circumcision in the Greco-Roman world|circumcision]] (''[[brit milah]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1                 = Schäfer|first1                = Peter|author-link1          = Peter Schäfer|title                 = Judeophobia: Attitudes Toward the Jews in the Ancient World|url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=8jIhYBwkO80C|publisher             = Harvard University Press|publication-date      = 1998|pages                  = 103–105|isbn                  = 9780674043213|accessdate            = 2014-02-01|quote                 = [...] Hadrian's ban on circumcision, allegedly imposed sometime between 128 and 132 CE [...]. The only proof for Hadrian's ban on circumcision is the short note in the ''Historia Augusta'': 'At this time also the Jews began war, because they were forbidden to mutilate their genitals (''quot vetabantur mutilare genitalia''). [...] The historical credibility of this remark is controversial [...] The earliest evidence for circumcision in Roman legislation is an edict by Antoninus Pius (138–161 CE), Hadrian's successor [...] [I]t is not utterly impossible that Hadrian [...] indeed considered circumcision as a 'barbarous mutilation' and tried to prohihit it. [...] However, this proposal cannot be more than a conjecture, and, of course, it does not solve the questions of when Hadrian issued the decree (before or during/after the Bar Kokhba war) and whether it was directed solely against Jews or also against other peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he, a [[Philhellenism|Hellenist]], viewed as [[mutilation]].&lt;ref name=Mackay&gt;Mackay, Christopher. ''Ancient Rome a Military and Political History'': 230&lt;/ref&gt; However, one scholar, Peter Schäfer, maintains that there is no evidence for this claim, given the notoriously problematical nature of the ''Historia Augusta'' as a source, the &quot;tomfoolery&quot; shown by the writer in this particular relevant passage, and the fact that contemporary Roman legislation on &quot;genital mutilation&quot; seems to address the general issue of [[castration]] of slaves by their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered: New Perspectives on the Second Jewish Revolt Against Rome''  Mohr Siebeck, 2003 pg 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World: The Jews of Palestine from Alexander the Great to the Arab Conquest''. Routledge:2003, pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]], ''Hadrian''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#14.2 14.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Hadrian had issued a [[rescript]] with a blanket ban on castration, performed on freeman or slave, voluntarily or not, on pain of death for both the performer and the patient.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'', 48.8.4.2 , quoted by Paul Du Plessis, ''Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law''. Oxford University Press, 2015, ISBN 9780199574889, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; Castration was legally put by Hadrian on a par with  [[conspiracy to murder]] and accordingly punished on the terms of the ''Lex Cornelia de Sicaris et Veneficis''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of an &quot;antisemitic&quot; legislation by Hadrian is, therefore, possibly an anachronistic (&quot;midrashic&quot;, in the words of a modern scholar)&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Wyner Mark, ed., ''The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite''. Lebanon, NH: UNiversity Press of New England, 2003, ISBN 1-58465-306-X, page 222&lt;/ref&gt; reading of ancient sources.

It is possible that other issues intervened between Hadrian's intention to rebuild Jerusalem and the outbreak of the war: the tension between incoming Roman colonists and supporters who had appropriated land confiscated after the First Jewish War and the landless poor, as well as the existence of messianic groups triggered by an interpretation of [[Jeremiah]]'s prophecy promising that the Temple would be rebuilt seventy years after its destruction, repeating the timing of the restoration of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]&amp;nbsp;– something that would put the restoration of the [[Second Temple]] to around 140.&lt;ref&gt;Shaye Cohen, ''From the Maccabees to the Mishnah'', Third Edition.

Hadrian's anti-Jewish policies (or, alternatively, assimilation policies by means of cultural and political hellenization)&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer,  &quot;Hadrian's policy in Judaea and the Bar Kokhba Revolt: a reassessment&quot;.

Based on the delineation of years in Eusebius' [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronicon'']] (now Chronicle of Jerome), it was only in the 16th year of Hadrian's reign, or what was equivalent to the 4th year of the 227th [[Olympiad]], that the Jewish revolt began, under the Roman governor [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Tineius (Tynius) Rufus]] who had asked for an army to crush the resistance.

Cambridge University Press: 2006, ISBN 978-0-521-77248-8, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;–  and it is believed that an entire legion, the [[Legio XXII Deiotariana|XXII Deiotariana]], which according to epigraphy did not outlast Hadrian's reign, was destroyed in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/xxii_deiotariana.html livius.org account. Note: website source states that Legio XXII &quot;was probably destroyed&quot; in the Bar Kokba revolt.](Legio XXII Deiotariana). Peter Schäfer, however, follows the doubtful stand taken by Bowersock, who argues that there are no traces in the written sources of the purported annihilation of Legio XXII, which, due to its magnitude, would have surely been mentioned (''Der Bar Kokhba-Aufstand'', 14).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Roman losses were so heavy that Hadrian's report to the [[Roman Senate]] omitted the customary salutation, &quot;If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the legions are in health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 69, 14.3{{cite book|title = Roman History|quote = Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore Hadrian in writing to the Senate did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrian's army eventually put down the rebellion in 135. According to Cassius Dio, overall war operations in the land of Judea left some 580,000 Jews killed, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed to the ground. The most famous battle took place in [[Betar (fortress)|Beitar]], a fortified city 10&amp;nbsp;km. southwest of Jerusalem. The city only fell after a lengthy siege of three and a half years, at which time Hadrian prohibited the Jews from burying their dead. They were eventually afforded burial when Antoninus Pius succeeded Hadrian as Roman Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5), end&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Babylonian [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Gittin 57a-58b; Lamentations Rabbah 2.2 §4;&lt;/ref&gt; after the war Hadrian continued the persecution of Jews.

The rabbinical sources, however, seem more concerned with morals and religion than with conveying history;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Judaism'', Volume 4, 728&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, occasionally such writings are known to contain embellished accounts of the war and its aftermath,&lt;ref&gt;On the unhistorical character of Bar Kokhba and of most accounts of the war, see Yael Zerubavel, ''Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition''. University of Chicago Press, 1997 ISBN 0-226-98157-6 , page 141&lt;/ref&gt; according to whom Hadrian attempted to root out [[Judaism]]&amp;nbsp;– which he saw as the cause of continuous rebellions&amp;nbsp;– prohibited the [[Torah]] law, the [[Hebrew calendar]] and executed Judaic scholars (see [[Ten Martyrs]]). The sacred scroll was ceremonially burned on the [[Temple Mount]]. In an attempt to erase the memory of Judaea, he renamed the province [[Syria Palaestina]] (after the [[Philistines]]; the name was found in [[Herodotus]]' histories),&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lewin, ''The Archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine''. Los Angeles: Getty Publications, 2005, ISBN 978-0-89236-800-6 , page 33&lt;/ref&gt; and Jews were barred from entering its rededicated capital. When Jewish sources mention Hadrian it is always with the epitaph &quot;may his bones be crushed&quot; (שחיק עצמות or שחיק טמיא, the Aramaic equivalent&lt;ref&gt;The Aramaic version, &quot;שחיק טמיא&quot;, is used, e.g., in [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%97 Genesis Rabbah 78:1]. This is referenced by [[Rashi]] in his comment on the phrase, &quot;טמא לנפש&quot;, in his [http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=39589&amp;p=3&amp;showrashi=true commentary on Numbers 5:2]. The other two locations in [[Genesis Rabbah]] referenced in Rashi's comment, 10:3 and 28:3, use the Hebrew version, &quot;שחיק עצמות&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;), an expression never used even with respect to [[Vespasian]] or [[Titus]], who destroyed the [[Second Temple]].

Other modern scholars contend that Hadrian's strictures on circumcision and his no-entry policy for Jews were poorly enforced, falling into abeyance with his death. Namely, Hadrian's legislation on castration was amended by Antoninus Pius in order to allow Jews to circumcise their own sons (Jewish proselytism among ''male'' converts remaining forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;Reidar Hvalvik, ''The Struggle for Scripture and Covenant: The Purpose of the Epistle of Barnabas and Jewish-Christian Competition in the Second Century''. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1996, pages 302/303&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the enslavement of Jewish war prisoners and of their suffering high war casualties and wanton destruction, it has been proposed that [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] remained predominantly Jewish in population, as well as its culture and religious life, a fact reflected by the completion of the [[Mishnah]] in the early Third Century (220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman, ''A Concise History of the Jewish People''. Lanham, MA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005, ISBN 0-7425-4366-8 , page 99&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], compiled in the 2nd and 3rd century CE, speaks of areas in Palestine that were at that time wholly supplanted by non-Jewish peoples, owing to the sparseness of its Jewish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate ''Demai'' 2:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem remained a special case, due to the fact that it was rebuilt as a purely Roman city&amp;nbsp;– a circumstance of which later Christian authors like Eusebius took advantage in order to stress its character as a Christian city and worship center.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kofsky, ''Eusebius of Cesarea Against Paganism''. Leiden: Brill, 2002, ISBN 0-391-04130-4 , pages  304/305&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the extent of the punitive measures taken by Hadrian against the Jewish population remains a matter of continuing debate in present-day historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Schwartz, Zeev Weiss, eds. ,''Was 70 CE a Watershed in Jewish History?: On Jews and Judaism before and after the Destruction of the Second Temple''. Leiden: Brill, 2011, ISBN 978-90-04-21534-4, page 529, footnote 42&lt;/ref&gt;

What Hadrian's bloody repression of the revolt undoubtedly did accomplish was to put an end to any measure of Jewish political independence alongside the Roman Imperial order.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''Who's Who in the Age of Jesus'', Penguin: 2006, no ISBN given, entry &quot;Hadrian&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Rabbinic literature===
Rabbinic literature is critical of Hadrian's policy, particularly that of religious intolerance concerning the Jews. Indeed, his policies were viewed as an attack on the religious freedom of the practice of [[Torah]] law. Most of the stories related by the Sages of Israel reflect a two-faced approach to tolerance of the Jewish people. In one story he punishes a Jew who failed to greet him, and then punishes another Jew who wished him well. When asked what the logic was for his punishing both men, he replied: &quot;You wish to give me advice on how to kill my enemies?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba), section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In another story, Hadrian got down from his chariot and bowed to a Jewish girl afflicted with leprosy. When queried by his soldiers as to why he did this, Hadrian responded with a dual verse from the [[book of Isaiah]] in praise of the nation of Israel: &quot;So says God the redeemer of Israel to the downtrodden soul to the (made) repulsive nation, kings will view and stand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[midrash HaGadol]] to dvarim 26:19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malbim]] commentary to the [[book of Daniel]] comments how Hadrian erected a statue of himself at the site of the [[Bet HaMikdash]] on a day marking the anniversary of the Temple's destruction by Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Malbim to Daniel 9:27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish historical records of that time,&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabba, Genesis Rabba 64 (end).&lt;/ref&gt; the famous rabbi and scholar and a contemporary of Hadrian, Rabbi Yehoshua, the son of Hananiah, opposed any Jewish military intervention against the occupying Roman army, in spite of Rome's harsh decrees against the Jewish people. Rabbi Yehoshua is reported as saying: &quot;A lion once pounced upon its prey and got a bone stuck in his throat. He then said, 'Whosoever comes and takes it out, I will give to him a reward.' An Egyptian heron came along whose bill is long, and reaching down into the lion's throat, extracted the bone. The bird then said to the lion, 'Give to me my reward.' The lion replied,  'Just be happy that you can say, I went down into the lion's mouth and I came out alive and well.' It is the same with us. It is enough that we have gone into this nation and came out with our lives.&quot;

==Final years==

===Succession===
[[File:Bronze head of Hadrian found in the River Thames in London.jpg|thumb|Bronze head of Hadrian found in the River Thames in London. Now in the [[British Museum]].]]
Hadrian spent the final years of his life at Rome. In 134, he took an Imperial [[salutation]] for the end of the Second Jewish War (which was not actually concluded until the following year). In 136, he dedicated a new [[Temple of Venus and Roma]] on the former site of Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]].

About this time, suffering from poor health, he turned to the problem of the succession. In 136 he adopted one of the ordinary [[Roman consul|consuls]] of that year, Lucius Ceionius Commodus, who took the name [[Lucius Aelius|Lucius Aelius Caesar]]. He was the son-in-law of [[Gaius Avidius Nigrinus]], one of the &quot;four consulars&quot; executed in 118, but was himself in delicate health. Also, his reputation was more that &quot;of a voluptuous, well educated great lord than that of a leader&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Merlin Alfred. Passion et politique chez les Césars (review of Jérôme Carcopino, ''Passion et politique chez les Césars''). In: ''Journal des savants''. Jan.-Mar. 1958. pp. 5–18. Available at [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jds_0021-8103_1958_num_1_1_3244]. Retrieved June 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Already at the time, it was ventured that Aelius had as his only commendation his beauty, a piece of gossip that found its way into the ''Historia Augusta'' biography.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Various modern attempts have been made to justify this apparently unjustified choice, one of them&amp;nbsp;– advanced by the French historian [[Jerome Carcopino]]&amp;nbsp;– being that Aelius was actually Hadrian's natural son.&lt;ref&gt;Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines : A History of the Roman Empire AD 14–192''. London: Routledge, 2014, page 699&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been speculated that Hadrian was fully aware that Aelius would never outlive him, and that the adoption of an aristocrat scion with no blood ties to the Emperor&lt;ref&gt;Albino Garzetti, n.p.g.&lt;/ref&gt; was a belated attempt to make amends for the episode of the four consulars, therefore aiming at a reconciliation with the powerful clan of old Italian families in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christol &amp; Nony, 159&quot;/&gt; Of the four consulars, Aelius' father-in-law Avidius Nigrinus had been Hadrian's chief rival for the throne, as a senator of highest rank, breeding, and connections, and as a [[stoicism|Stoic]]. According to the ''Historia Augusta'', early in his reign Hadrian had even considered making Nigrinus his heir apparent, before eventually deciding to get rid of this worthy opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Cizek , &quot;L'éloge de Caius Avidius Nigrinus&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Granted tribunician power and the joint governorship of [[Pannonia Superior]] and Pannonia Inferior&amp;nbsp;– a commission that he discharged honorably, according to the ''Historia Augusta''&lt;ref&gt;András Mócsy, ''Pannonia and Upper Moesia (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-74582-6 , page 102&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Aelius Caesar held a further consulship in 137, but died on 1&amp;nbsp;January 138.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 289–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Aelius Caesar, Hadrian next adopted Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus (the future emperor Antoninus Pius), who had served as one of the five imperial legates of Italy (a post created by Hadrian) and as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. On 25&amp;nbsp;February 138 Antoninus received tribunician power and [[imperium]]. Moreover, to ensure the future of the dynasty, Hadrian required Antoninus to adopt both Lucius Ceionius Commodus (son of the deceased Aelius Caesar) and Marcus Annius Verus (who was the grandson of an influential senator [[Marcus Annius Verus|of the same name]] who had been Hadrian's close friend; Annius was already betrothed to Aelius Caesar’s daughter [[Ceionia Fabia]]). Hadrian's precise intentions in this arrangement are debatable.

Though the consensus is that he wanted Annius Verus (who would later become the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]) to succeed Antoninus, it has also been argued that he actually intended Ceionius Commodus, the son of his own adopted son, to succeed, but was constrained to show favour simultaneously to Annius Verus because of his strong connections to the Hispano-Narbonensian nexus of senatorial families of which Hadrian himself was a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley 1967 p. 601&quot;&gt;The adoptions: Anthony Birley, pp. 294–5; T.D. Barnes, 'Hadrian and Lucius Verus', ''Journal of Roman Studies'' (1967), Ronald Syme, ''Tacitus'', p.&amp;nbsp;601. Antoninus as a legate of Italy: Anthony Birley, p.&amp;nbsp;199&lt;/ref&gt; As Annius Verus was the step-grandson of the then Prefect of Rome [[Lucius Catilius Severus]], one of the remnants of the all-powerful group of Spanish senators from Trajan's reign, it was unavoidable that Hadrian should show some favor to the grandson in order to count on the grandfather's support.&lt;ref&gt;Des Boscs-Plateaux, 311&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, according to one [[prosopography]], that Catilius Severus was the third and last husband of Hadrian's mother, Domitia Lucilla ''Major''. As Lucilla Major's second husband, Publius Calvisius Ruso, was the father of [[Domitia Lucilla]] ''Minor'', Annius Verus' mother, Lucilla Minor, would actually be Hadrian's half-sister, and Annius Verus, therefore, his (half)nephew.&lt;ref&gt;Des Boscs-Plateaux,, 241 and 577; see also stemma, 477; Frank McLynn,''Marcus Aurelius: A Life''. New York: Da Capo, 2010, ISBN 978-0-306-81916-2 , page 84&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, in advancing Annius Verus, Hadrian would promote his own bloodline's fortunes. Note, however, that this prosopography is not universally accepted by other scholars, who argue that Hadrian's mother was known, according to ''Historia Augusta'', as Domitia ''Paulina''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, it may well not have been Hadrian, but rather Antoninus Pius&amp;nbsp;– who was Annius Verus's uncle&amp;nbsp;– who advanced the latter to the principal position. The fact that Annius would divorce Ceionia Fabia and remarry to Antoninus' daughter Annia Faustina points in the same direction. When he eventually became Emperor, Marcus Aurelius would co-opt Ceionius Commodus as his co-Emperor (under the name of [[Lucius Verus]]) on his own initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Birley 1967 p. 601&quot;/&gt; Also, there is the fact that Marcus Aurelius, when already emperor, behaved coldly towards the memory of his adoptive grandfather, who is conspicuously absent from the list of people to which Marcus acknowledged a debt of gratitude in his ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;McLynn, 42&lt;/ref&gt; As emperor, Marcus would be far more attracted to the conservative, &quot;serious&quot;, Roman outlook of Antoninus' reign than to Hadrian's more open, &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;Hellenic&quot; outlook&amp;nbsp;– including Hadrian's almost exclusive homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 122&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that Marcus Aurelius's relationship towards Antinous's memory was one of total silence.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century''. University of Chicago Press: 2009, ISBN 0-226-06711-4 , page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient sources present Hadrian's last few years as marked by conflict and unhappiness. The adoption of Aelius Caesar proved unpopular, not least with Hadrian's brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus]] and Servianus's grandson Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator. Servianus, though now far too old, had stood in the line of succession at the beginning of the reign; Fuscus is said to have had designs on the imperial power for himself, and in 137 he may have attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] in which his grandfather was implicated. Whatever the truth, Hadrian ordered that both be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, pp. 291–2&lt;/ref&gt; Servianus is reported to have prayed before his execution that Hadrian would &quot;long for death but be unable to die&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#17.2 69.17.2]&lt;/ref&gt; The prayer was fulfilled; as Hadrian suffered from his final, protracted illness, he had to be prevented from [[suicide]] on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Hadrian died in the year 138 on the 10th of July, in his [[Roman villa|villa]] at [[Baiae]] at the age of 62. The cause of death is believed to have been heart failure. [[Dio Cassius]] and the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' record details of his failing health.

He was buried first at [[Puteoli]], near Baiae, on an estate which had once belonged to [[Cicero]]. Soon after, his remains were transferred to Rome and buried in the Gardens of Domitia, close by the almost-complete mausoleum. Upon completion of the [[Tomb of Hadrian]] in Rome in 139 by his successor Antoninus Pius, his body was cremated, and his ashes were placed there together with those of his wife [[Vibia Sabina]] and his first adopted son, [[Lucius Aelius]], who also died in 138. After threatening the Senate&amp;nbsp;– which toyed with refusing Hadrian's divine honors&amp;nbsp;– by refusing to assume power himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, 816&quot;&gt;Salmon, 816&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus eventually succeeded in having his predecessor deified&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/70*.html#1.1 70.1.1]&lt;/ref&gt; in 139 and given a [[temple of Hadrian|temple]] on the [[Campus Martius]], ornamented with reliefs representing the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ball Platner, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome''. Cambridge University Press: 2015, ISBN 978-1-108-08324-9 , page 250&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate in consequence agreed to give Antoninus the title Pius for his filial piety in granting his adoptive father honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, 816&quot;/&gt; At the same time, in order to mark the Senate's illwill, commemorative coinage honoring Hadrian's [[consecration]] was kept to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Bechtold, ''Gott und Gestirn als Präsenzformen des toten Kaisers: Apotheose und Katasterismos in der politischen Kommunikation der römischen Kaiserzeit und ihre Anknüpfungspunkte im Hellenismus''.V&amp;R unipress GmbH: 2011, ISBN 978-3-89971-685-6, page 259&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poem by Hadrian====
According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', Hadrian composed shortly before his death the following poem:&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Hadrian'' Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#25.9 25.9]; Antony Birley, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoninus Pius''' ({{lang-la|Titus Fulvus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;&gt;Weigel, ''Antoninus Pius''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Antoninus' name would be inscribed as TITVS AELIVS HADRIANVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS PIVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 19 September, 86 AD –  7 March, 161 AD), also known as '''Antoninus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 138 to 161. He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]] and the [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

He acquired the [[cognomen|name]] [[Pius]] after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deify]] his adoptive father [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 54; Dio, 70:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 55, citing the ''[[Historia Augusta]],'' ''Life of Hadrian'' 24.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood and family===
He was born as the only child of [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]], [[consul]] in 89&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; whose family came from [[Nemausus]] (modern [[Nîmes]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; Titus Aurelius Fulvius was the son of a senator of the same name, who, as legate of [[Legio III Gallica]], had supported [[Vespasian]] in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship, plus an ordinary one under [[Domitian]] in 85. The Aurelii Fulvii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from [[Gallia Narbonensis]] whose rise to prominence was supported by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Thomas Dupuis Whitfield, &quot;THE RISE OF NEMAUSUS FROM AUGUSTUS TO ANTONINUS PIUS: A PROSOPOGRAPHICAL STUDY OF NEMAUSIAN SENATORS AND EQUESTRIANS&quot;.M.A. Thesis, Queen's University, Ontario, 2012, pages 49/57. Available at [http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/7181/1/Whitfield_Hugo_TD_201204_MA.pdf].Accessed January 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The link between Antoninus' family and the their home province explains the increasing importance of the post of [[Proconsul]] of Gallia Narbonensis during the late Second Century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gayraud, &quot;Le proconsulat de Narbonnaise sous le Haut-Empire&quot;. In: ''Revue des Études Anciennes''. Tome 72, 1970, n°3-4. pp. 344-363.Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1970_num_72_3_3874]. Accessed January 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus was born near [[Lanuvium]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Paul B., ''Religion in republican Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, pg. 134; Canduci, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was Arria Fadilla. Antoninus’ father died shortly after his 89 ordinary consulship, his son being raised by his maternal grandfather [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of [[Pliny the Younger]]. The Arrii Antoninii were an older senatorial family from Italy, very influential during [[Nerva]]'s reign.Arria Fadilla, Antoninus'mother, married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus, a man of consular rank, suffect consul in 98, and two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla, were born from that union.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 242; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
Some time between 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria [[Faustina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;  They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul [[Marcus Annius Verus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rupilia]] Faustina (a half-sister to Roman Empress [[Vibia Sabina]]). Faustina was a beautiful woman, well known for her wisdom. She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans.

Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 34; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; They were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie, David 1921&quot;&gt;Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie, David 1921&quot;/&gt;  His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin.
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Lucius Lamia Silvanus, consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or [[Faustina the Younger]] (between 125–130–175), a future Roman Empress, married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in 146.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 528&lt;/ref&gt;  In honor of her memory, he asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to deify her as a goddess, and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the [[Roman Forum]] in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 77; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 6:7&lt;/ref&gt;  He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVA FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it ''Puellae Faustinianae'' or ''Girls of Faustina'', which assisted destitute girls &lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt; of good family.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Daucé : &quot;Découverte à Rennes d'une pièce de Faustine jeune&quot;. In: ''Annales de Bretagne''. Tome 75, numéro 1, 1968. pp. 270-276, page 272 Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/abpo_0003-391x_1968_num_75_1_2460]. Retrieved October 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Antoninus created a new ''alimenta'' (see [[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]).

===Favor with Hadrian===
Having filled the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]] with more than usual success,&lt;ref&gt;Traver, Andrew G., ''From polis to empire, the ancient world, c. 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', (2002) pg. 33; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 2:9&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained the consulship in 120.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt; He was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], probably during 134–135.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman,pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of his first adopted son [[Lucius Aelius]],&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 517&lt;/ref&gt; on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Lucius Aelius, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;

By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive son through his new father.  The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son.

The emperor and his ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' were deified after their death by [[Marcus Aurelius]].]]

On his accession, Antoninus' name became &quot;Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus&quot;. One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 55; Canduci, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury,pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 6.2; ''Verus'' 2.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;&gt;Weigel,''Antoninus Pius''&lt;/ref&gt;  Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt;Epigraphical and prosopographical research  has revealed tha Antoninus' imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families, most of them members of the priestly congregation for the cult of Hadrian, the ''sodales Hadrianales''. According to the German historian [[Hans-Georg Pflaum|H.G. Pflaum]], prosopographical research of Antoninus' ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial [[caste]]&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Pflaum, &quot;Les prêtres du culte impérial sous le règne d'Antonin le Pieux&quot;.

Accessed January 27 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  

===A non-military reign===

There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written &quot;It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Wilkes, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Volume LXXV 1985, ISSN 0075-4358, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the [[Principate]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 525&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 525&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time. Such disturbances happened in [[Mauretania]] - where a senator was named as governor of [[Mauretania Tingitana]] in place of the usual equestrian procurator&lt;ref&gt;René Rebuffat, '&quot;Enceintes urbaines et insécurité en Maurétanie Tingitane&quot; In: ''Mélanges de l'Ecole française de Rome. Antiquité'', tome 86, n°1. 1974. pp. 501-522. Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/mefr_0223-5102_1974_num_86_1_970]. Accessed December 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and cavalry reinforcements from Panonnia were brought in,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Christol , &quot;L'armée des provinces pannoniennes et la pacification des révoltes maures sous Antonin le Pieux&quot;. In: ''Antiquités africaines'', 17,1981. pp. 133-141.&lt;/ref&gt; towns such as [[Sala Colonia|Sala]] and [[Tipasa]] being fortified.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant, ''The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition''. Abingdon: Routledge, 1996, ISBN  0-415-13814-0 , page 17; Rebuffat &quot;Enceintes urbaines&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similar disturbances took place in [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], and amongst the [[Brigantes]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], none of them being considered serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 525&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 525&lt;/ref&gt;  It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt; a native of [[Numidia]] and previously governor of [[Germania Inferior]].&lt;ref&gt;Salway, ''A History of Roman Britain''. Oxford University Press: 2001, ISBN 0-19-280138-4, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Under instructions from the emperor, Lollius undertook an invasion of southern [[Scotland]], winning some significant victories, and constructing the [[Antonine Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The wall, however, was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid-150s and eventually abandoned late during the reign (early 160s), for reasons that are still not quite clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Colin Arthur Shotter, ''Roman Britain'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-31943-9 , page 49&lt;/ref&gt; Antonine's Wall is mentioned in just one literary source, Antoninus' biography in the [[Historia Augusta]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain. In one inscription honoring Antoninus, erected by [[Legio II Augusta]], which participated in the building of the Wall, a [[The Bridgeness Slab|relief]] showing four naked prisoners, one of them beheaded, seems to stand for some actual warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Voisin, &quot;Les Romains, chasseurs de têtes&quot;. In: ''Du châtiment dans la cité. Supplices corporels et peine de mort dans le monde antique''. Table ronde de Rome (9-11 novembre 1982) Rome : École Française de Rome, 1984. pp. 241-293.Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/efr_0000-0000_1984_act_79_1_2537]. Accessed January 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Antonine's Wall was, in principle, much shorter and outwardly more defensible than Hadrian's Wall, the area included by it into the empire was barren, therefore straining supply lines and not worthy holding to on a cost benefit analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Spring, ''Great Walls and Linear Barriers''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword, 2015, ISBN 978-1-84884-377-6, page  75&lt;/ref&gt; It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics, that is, offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign. Actually, the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation - that is, by Antoninus formally taking for the second (and last) time the title of [[Imperator]] -  in 142.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Breeze, ''Roman Frontiers in Britain''. London: Bloomsbury, 2013, ISBN 978-1-8539-9698-6, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus' need to publicize his achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Salway, 149&lt;/ref&gt;The orator [[Fronto]] was later to say that, although Antoninus bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others, he should be regarded as the helmsman who directed the voyage, whose glory, therefore, belonged to him.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', London: Routledge, 2012, ISBN 0-415-17125-3 , page 61&lt;/ref&gt;  

That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need, is proved by the fact that, although generally peaceful, Antoninus' reign was not free from attempts of usurpation: [[Historia Augusta]] mentions two, made by senators Cornelius Priscianus (by the way, Lollius Urbicus' successor as governor of Britain) and Atilius Rufius Titianus - both confirmed by the [[Fasti Ostienses]] as well as by the erasing of Priscianus' name on an inscription &lt;ref&gt;Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-1-138-01920-1 , page 447; [[Paul Veyne]], ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'' ,Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4 ,page 28, footnote 61; Salway, 149&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, Antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression: Priscianus committed suicide and Titianus was found guilty by the Senate, with Antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families' properties&lt;ref&gt;Marta García Morcillo, ''Las ventas por subasta en el mundo romano: la esfera privada''. Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 2005, ISBN 84-475-3017-5 , page 301&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also some troubles in [[Dacia Inferior]] which required the granting of additional powers to the [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt; On the Northern [[Black Sea]] coast, the Greek city of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]] was held against the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt; Gocha R. Tsetskhladze, ed., ''North Pontic Archaeology: Recent Discoveries and Studies''. Leiden: Brill, 2001, ISBN 90-04-12041-6 ,page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Also during his reign the governor of [[Upper Germany]], probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the [[Agri Decumates]], advancing the [[Limes Germanicus]] fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring [[Raetia]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt;In the East, Roman suzerainity over [[Armenia]] was retained by the 140 choosing of [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] scion [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Sohaemus]] as client king.&lt;ref&gt;Rouben Paul Adalian, ''Historical Dictionary of Armenia'', Lanham: Scarecrow, 2010, ISBN 978-0-8108-6096-4 , entry &quot;Arshakuni/Arsacid&quot;, page 174&lt;/ref&gt;  

Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,&lt;ref&gt;Speidel, Michael P., ''Riding for Caesar: The Roman Emperors' Horse Guards'', Harvard University Press, 1997, pg. 50; Canduci, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.&lt;ref&gt;See Victor, 15:3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy and Administration===

Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads -, the Emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasure, of around two and a half million sesterzi.

The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected [[Rhodes]] and the [[Province of Asia]]. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, ''circa'' 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit [[Cyzicus]] - where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burrell.

Antoninus' financial help earned him praise by Greek writers such as [[Aelius Aristides]] and Pausanias.&lt;ref&gt;E.E. Bryant, ''The Reign of Antoninus Pius''. Cambridge University Press: 1895, pages 45/46 and 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These cities received from Antoninus the usual honorific accolades, such as when he commended that all governors of Asia should enter the province, when taking office, by way of Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Gempf, ed., ''The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting''.

In his dealings with Greek-speaking cities, Antoninus followed the policy adopted by Hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites, specially with local intellectuals: philosophers, teachers of literature, rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties envolving private spending for civic purposes - a privilege granted by Hadrian that Antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] (27.1.6.8).&lt;ref&gt;Philip A.

Antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations - both Roman and foreign. He is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice, a [[taurobolium]], formerly only a private ritual, now being also performed for the sake of the Emperor's welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History''. London: Routledge, 2012, ISBN 978-0-415-52217-5 , page 92&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus also offered patronage to the worship of [[Mithra]], to whom he erected a temple in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Dill, ''Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius''. Library of Alexandria, s.d.g.&lt;/ref&gt; In 148, he presided over the celebrations of the 900th anniversary of the founding of Rome.

===Legal reforms===
Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the ''res publica'', no matter how extended and ill-defined his competences were: therefore the fact that he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasure, the [[Fiscus]]. This splitting had to do with the division of Imperial properties into two parts: firstly, the fiscus itself-or ''patrimonium'', meaning the properties of the &quot;Crown&quot;, the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne, transmitted to his successors in office,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', London: 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-954556-8, entry &quot;Patrimonium&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of their being members of the imperial family or not;&lt;ref&gt;After the death of [[Nero]], the personal properties of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had been appropriated by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]], and therefore turned into public properties: Carrié &amp; Roussele, 586&lt;/ref&gt; secondly, the ''res privata'', the &quot;private&quot; properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, 586&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote in the [[Historia Augusta]] biography, where Antoninus replies to Faustina - who complained about his stingness - that &quot;we have gained an empire [and] lost even what we had before&quot; possibly relates to Antoninus' actual concerns at the creation of the ''res privata''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History, XI: The High Empire, AD 70-192''. Cambridge U.P., 2009, ISBN 0-521-26333-2, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; While still a private citizen, Antoninus had increased his personal fortune greatly by mean of various legacies, the consequence - we are told - of his caring scrupulously for his relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Champlin, ''Final Judgments: Duty and Emotion in Roman Wills, 200 B.C.-A.D. 250''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991,ISBN 0-520-07103-4, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''res privata'' lands could be sold and/or given away, while the ''patrimonium'' properties were regarded as public.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-84054-5 , page 49&lt;/ref&gt; It was a way of pretending that the Imperial function - and most properties attached to it - was a public one, formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Bellen, &quot;Die 'Verstaatlichung' des Privatvermögens der römische Kaiser&quot;. Hildegard Temporini, ed., ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', Berlin: De Gruyter, 1974, ISBN 3-11-004571-0, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;  That the distinction played no part in subsequent political history - that the ''personal'' power of the princeps absorbed his role as office-holder - proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Aloys Winterling, ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. Malden, MA: John Wiley &amp; sons, 2009, ISBN 978-1-4051-7969-0 , pages 73/75&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign. However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt; One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers (&quot;irenarchs&quot;) in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations,to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Ando, ''Imperial Rome AD 193 to 284: The Critical Century''. Edinburgh University Press, 2012,ISBN 978-0-7486-2050-0,page 91&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into [[Roman law]] many important new principles based upon this notion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;

In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L. Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises;&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Crook, ''Consilium Principis: Imperial Councils and Counsellors from Augustus to Diocletian'. Cambridge U.P.: 1955, page 67&lt;/ref&gt; L. Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and three others .&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt; These last three included L. Volusius Maecianus, a former military officer turned by Antoninus into a civil procurator, and who, in view of his subsequent career (discovered on the basis of epigraphical and prosopographical research) was the Emperor's most important legal adviser.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arthur Schiller, ''Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development''. The Hague: Mouton, 1978, ISBN 90-279-7744-5 , page 477&lt;/ref&gt; Maecianus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures (see below) as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius. He was also the author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts). As a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government,&lt;ref&gt; George Mousourakis, ''Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition'', Heidelberg: Springer, ISBN 978-3-319-12267-0, page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus' reign also saw the appearance of the ''Institutes of Gaius'', an elementary legal manual for beginners (see [[Gaius (jurist)]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the [[enfranchisement]] of [[slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, he favoured the principle of ''favor libertatis'', giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome''. Cambridge University Press: 1994, ISBN 9780521263351 , page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he punished the killing of a slave by his/her master without previous trial&lt;ref&gt;Aubert, Jean-Jacques. &quot;L’esclave en droit romain ou l’impossible réification de l’homme.&quot; Esclavage et travail forcé, ''Cahiers de la Recherche sur les droits fondamentaux'' (CRDF).

''Fear of slaves, fear of enslavement in the ancient Mediterranean''. Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 2007 ISBN 978-2-84867-169-7 , page 159&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus upheld the enforcement of contracts for selling of female slaves forbidding their further employment in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Carrié &amp; Aline Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain en Mutation, des Sévères à Constantin, 192-337''. Paris: Seuil 1999, ISBN 2-02-025819-6, page 290&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are [[Presumption of innocence|not to be treated as guilty before trial]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt;- as in the case of the irenarchs (see above).He also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of [[torture]] in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be stressed that Antoninus ''extended'', by means of a [[rescript]], the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] , 48.18.9, as quoted by Edward Peters, ''Torture'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, ISBN 0-8122-1599-0 , page  29&lt;/ref&gt; Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status (''humiliores'') had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank (''honestiores'') in general.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 154/155.&lt;/ref&gt;

One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of [[Rome]] being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.68&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars place Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Judah the Prince]]. According to the [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with &quot;Antoninus&quot;, possibly Antoninus Pius,&lt;ref&gt;A. Mischcon, Abodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, &quot;SJ Rappaport... is of opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius.&quot; Other opinions cited suggest &quot;Antoninus&quot; was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;/ref&gt; who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.

===Death===
In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions.Marcus Aurelius had already been created consul with Antoninus in 140, receiving the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] - i.e., heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey William Adams, ''Marcus Aurelius in the Historia Augusta and Beyond''. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013, ISBN 978-0-7391-7638-2 ,pages 74/75.&lt;/ref&gt; As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still after the death -in 156 or 157 - of one of Antoninus' most trusted advisers, Gavius Maximus, who had been [[praetorian prefect]] (an office that was as much secretarial as military) for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 112; Grant, ''The Antonines'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; Gavius Maximus, who had been one of the most important members of Antoninus' &quot;team&quot; of long standing advisers, had been awarded with the consular insignia and to the honors due to a senator.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Petrus Josephus Van Den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto''. Leiden: Bril, 199, ISBN 9004109579 , page 389&lt;/ref&gt; He had left behind himself the reputation of being an strictly disciplinarian (''vir severissimus'', according to ''Historia Augusta'') as well as some lasting grudges among fellow equestrian procurators- one of them , by predeceasing Gavius and vilifying him in his will, created a serious embarassment to one of the heirs, the orator Fronto.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Final Judgments'', 16&lt;/ref&gt; Gavius Maximus' death offered the opportunity to a welcome change in the ruling team, and it has been speculated that it was the legal adviser Volusius Maecianus - who, after a brief spell as Praefect of Egypt, took the office of [[Praefectus annonae]] in Rome - who assumed the role of grey emminence precisely in order to prepare the incoming - and altogether new - joint succession.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Christol, &quot;Préfecture du prétoire et haute administration équestre à la fin du règne d’Antonin le Pieux et au début du règne de Marc Aurèle&quot;.

Accessed January 27 2016&lt;/ref&gt;In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at [[Lorium]], in [[Etruria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; about twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 15:7&quot;&gt;Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.33.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password—&quot;aequanimitas&quot; (equanimity).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 532&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 532&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 12.4–8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing [[Tiberius]] by a couple of months).&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, &quot;elaborate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118, 278 n.6.&lt;/ref&gt; If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the [[Campus Martius]], while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. However, it seems that this was not the case: according to his [[Historia Augusta]] biography (which seems to reproduce an earlier, detailed report)  Antoninus' body (and not his ashes) was buried in [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's mausoleum]]. After a seven-day interval (''justitium'') Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, &quot;Origines et sens de l'inhumation à l'époque impériale&quot;.

Accessed January 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A ''[[flamen]]'', or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now ''Divus Antoninus''.

A [[Column of Antoninus Pius|column]] was dedicated to Antoninus on the [[Campus Martius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt; and the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina|temple]] he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 532&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 532&lt;/ref&gt; It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
[[Image:Sbeitla 04.jpg|thumb|250px|Arch of Antoninus Pius in [[Sbeïtla]], [[Tunisia]].]]
The only account of his life handed down to us is that of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know.

===In later scholarship===
Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{quote|A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης &quot;cummin-splitter&quot;). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.}}

Later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 524&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inevitably, the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and [[Italy]] and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the third century.  German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''Römische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised &quot;a succession of grossly wasted opportunities,&quot; given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing.  Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders.

==Descendants==
Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor [[Commodus]].  The family of Antoninus Pius and [[Faustina the Elder]] also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son.  Direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century AD.

'''Marcus Aurelius''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|r|iː|l|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Aurelius' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|He was originally named Marcus Annius Catilius Severus (or perhaps Marcus Catilius Severus).&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Marcus'' 1.9; McLynn, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; When he married he took the name Marcus Annius Verus,&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Marcus'' 1.10; McLynn, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and when he was named emperor, he was given the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|group=notes}} 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 161 to 180. He ruled with [[Lucius Verus]] as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169. He was the last of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]], and is also considered one of the most important [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers.

During his reign, the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] defeated a revitalized [[Parthian Empire]] in the East: Aurelius' general [[Avidius Cassius]] sacked the capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 164. In central Europe, Aurelius fought the [[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatians]] with success during the [[Marcomannic Wars]], although the threat of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. A revolt in the East led by Avidius Cassius failed to gain momentum and was suppressed immediately.

Marcus Aurelius' [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tome ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered as a literary monument to a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve [[equanimity]] in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration.

==Sources==

The major sources for the life and rule of Marcus Aurelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as &quot;the biographer&quot;) from the later 4th century (c. 395).&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, 1889&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 229–30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's &quot;Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der ''Scriptoes Historiae Augustae''&quot; (in German), ''Hermes'' 24 (1889), 337ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources ([[Marius Maximus]] or Ignotus), are much more accurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, 1889&quot;/&gt; For Marcus' life and rule, the biographies of [[Hadrian]], Antoninus Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are full of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 230. On the ''HA Verus'', see Barnes, 65–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

A body of correspondence between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, &quot;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n14/bear01_.html Was He Quite Ordinary?]&quot;, ''London Review of Books'' 31:14 (23 July 2009), accessed 15 September 2009; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus' own ''Meditations'' offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The main narrative source for the period is [[Cassius Dio]], a Greek senator from [[Bithynian]] [[Nicaea]] who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 228–29, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician [[Galen]] on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of [[Aelius Aristides]] on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the ''Digest'' and ''Codex Justinianus'' on Marcus' legal work.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] and [[numismatics|coin finds]] supplement the literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Marcus Aurelius}}
Marcus' family originated in [[Espejo, Córdoba|Ucubi]], a small town southeast of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in Iberian [[Baetica]]. The family rose to prominence in the late 1st century AD. Marcus' great-grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (I) was a [[Roman Senate|senator]] and (according to the ''Historia Augusta'') ex-[[praetor]]; in 73–74, his grandfather, [[Marcus Annius Verus|Marcus Annius Verus (II)]], was made a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]].&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 1.2, 1.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 28; McLynn, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Cassius Dio asserts that the Annii were near-kin of Hadrian, and that it was to these familial ties that they owed their rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.2, 71.35.2–3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise nature of these kinship ties is nowhere stated. One conjectural bond runs through Annius Verus (II). Verus' wife [[Rupilia|Rupilia Faustina]] was the daughter of the consular senator [[Libo Rupilius Frugi]] and an unnamed mother. It has been hypothesized Rupilia Faustina's mother was [[Salonina Matidia|Matidia]], who was also the mother (presumably through another marriage) of [[Vibia Sabina]], Hadrian's wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+14,+03579&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 14.3579]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 29; McLynn, 14, 575 n. 53, citing Ronald Syme, ''Roman Papers'' 1.244.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Verus' elder son—Marcus Aurelius' father—[[Marcus Annius Verus (praetor)|Marcus Annius Verus (III)]] married [[Domitia Lucilla]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 29; McLynn, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Young Marcus Aurelius.jpg|thumb|Statue of young Marcus Aurelius from a private collection housed in the San Antonio Museum of Art]]

[[Lucilla]] was the daughter of the patrician P. Calvisius Tullus Ruso and the elder Domitia Lucilla. The elder Domitia Lucilla had inherited a great fortune (described at length in one of [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]]'s letters) from her maternal grandfather and her paternal grandfather by adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 29, citing Pliny, ''Epistulae'' 8.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Lucilla would acquire much of her mother's wealth, including a large brickworks on the outskirts of Rome—a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Young Marcus Aurelius Musei Capitolini MC279.jpg|thumb|A bust of Marcus Aurelius as a young boy ([[Capitoline Museum]]).

[[Anthony Birley]], Marcus' modern biographer, writes of the bust: &quot;This is certainly a grave young man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Lucilla and Verus (III) had two children: a son, Marcus, born on 26 April 121, and a daughter, [[Annia Cornificia Faustina]], probably born in 122 or 123.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Verus (III) probably died in 124, during his [[praetor]]ship, when Marcus was only three years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Farquharson dates his death to 130, when Marcus was nine.&lt;ref&gt;Farquharson, 1.95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Though he can hardly have known him, Marcus Aurelius wrote in his ''Meditations'' that he had learned &quot;modesty and manliness&quot; from his memories of his father and from the man's posthumous reputation.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla did not remarry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:0 Marcus Aurelius - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini (1).JPG|thumb|right|Portrait of Emperor Marcus Aurelius - [[Palazzo Nuovo]] ([[Musei Capitolini]]).]]
Lucilla, following prevailing aristocratic customs, probably did not spend much time with her son. Marcus was in the care of &quot;nurses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 2.1 and ''Meditations'' 5.4, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Marcus credits his mother with teaching him &quot;religious piety, simplicity in diet&quot; and how to avoid &quot;the ways of the rich&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.3, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters, Marcus makes frequent and affectionate reference to her; he was grateful that, &quot;although she was fated to die young, yet she spent her last years with me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.17.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death, Aurelius was raised by his paternal grandfather Marcus Annius Verus who, according to Roman Law, had always retained the &quot;patria potestas&quot; over his son and grandson. Technically this was not an adoption, since an adoption would be the legal creation of a new and different &quot;patria potestas&quot; (II).&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 33&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Another man, [[Lucius Catilius Severus]], also participated in his upbringing. Severus is described as Marcus' &quot;maternal great-grandfather&quot;; he is probably the stepfather of the elder Lucilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 33&quot;/&gt; Marcus was raised in his parents' home on the [[Caelian Hill]], a district he would affectionately refer to as &quot;my Caelian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 2.8.2 (= Haines 1.142), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an upscale region, with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas. Marcus' grandfather owned his own palace beside the [[Lateran Palace|Lateran]], where Marcus would spend much of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him &quot;good character and avoidance of bad temper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He was less fond of the mistress his grandfather took and lived with after the death of Rupilia Faustina, his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 35&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was grateful that he did not have to live with her longer than he did.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.17.2; Farquharson, 1.102; McLynn, 23; cf. ''Meditations'' 1.17.11; Farquharson, 1.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends;&lt;ref&gt;McLynn, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks [[Lucius Catilius Severus|Catilius Severus]] for encouraging him to avoid public schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.4; McLynn, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his teachers, Diognetus, a painting-master, proved particularly influential; he seems to have introduced Marcus to the philosophic way of life.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 2.2, 4.9; ''Meditations'' 1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 37; McLynn, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough Greek cloak, and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 2.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 38; McLynn, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new set of tutors—[[Alexander of Cotiaeum]], Trosius Aper and Tuticius Proculus{{refn|Birley amends the text of the ''HA Marcus'' from &quot;Eutychius&quot; to &quot;Tuticius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Later Caesars'', 109, 109 n.8; ''Marcus Aurelius'', 40, 270 n.27, citing ''Bonner Historia-Augusta Colloquia'' 1966/7, 39ff.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}—took over Marcus' education in about 132 or 133.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 2.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 40, 270 n.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the latter two (both teachers of Latin), but Alexander was a major littérateur, the leading [[Homer]]ic scholar of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 40, citing Aelius Aristides, ''Oratio'' 32 K; McLynn, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks Alexander for his training in literary styling.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.10; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 40; McLynn, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's influence—an emphasis on matter over style, on careful wording, with the occasional Homeric quotation—has been detected in Marcus' ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley,  ''Marcus Aurelius'', 40, 270 n.28, citing A.S.L. Farquharson, ''The Meditations of Marcus Antoninus'' (Oxford, 1944) 2.453.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession to Hadrian, 136–38===
In late 136, Hadrian almost died from a haemorrhage. Convalescent in [[Hadrian's Villa|his villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], he selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his successor, and adopted him as his son.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection was done ''invitis omnibus'', &quot;against the wishes of everyone&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' 23.10, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; its rationale is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 42. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, &quot;Hadrian and Lucius Verus&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, &quot;Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo&quot;, ''Phoenix'' 49:4 (1995): 319–30.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his adoption, Commodus took the name [[Lucius Aelius]] Caesar. After a brief stationing on the Danube frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' 23.15–16; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 45; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Commodus was a known consumptive at the time of his adoption, so Hadrian may have intended Marcus' eventual succession anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.17.1; ''HA Aelius'' 3.7, 4.6, 6.1–7; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} On 24 January 138, Hadrian selected [[Antoninus Pius|Aurelius Antoninus]] as his new successor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 46. Date: Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few days' consideration, Antoninus accepted. He was adopted on 25 February. As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus adopted Marcus and [[Lucius Verus]], the son of  Lucius Aelius. By this scheme,  Lucius Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his new father. The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the later's wife and would be his favorite son.

Marcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus; Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At Hadrian's request, Antoninus' daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Hadrian'' 24.1; ''HA Aelius'' 6.9; ''HA Antoninus Pius'' 4.6–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was appalled to learn that Hadrian would become his adoptive grandfather. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 5.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time in 138, Hadrian requested in the senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming ''[[quaestor]]'' before his twenty-fourth birthday. The senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, consul for 139.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus' adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. But for his adoption, he probably would have become ''[[Triumvir Monetalis|triumvir monetalis]]'', a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as [[military tribune|tribune with a legion]], becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: &quot;He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 5.6–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 019.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Baiae, seaside resort and site of Hadrian's last days. Marcus would holiday in the town with the imperial family in the summer of 143.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[J. M. W. Turner|J.M.W. Turner]], ''The Bay of Baiae, with Apollo and Sybil'', 1823)]]
After a series of suicide attempts, all thwarted by Antoninus, Hadrian left for [[Baiae]], a seaside resort on the [[Campania]]n coast. His condition did not improve, and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors, indulging himself in food and drink. He sent for Antoninus, who was at his side when he died on 10 July 138.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.22.4; ''HA Hadrian'' 25.5–6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 50–51. Hadrian's suicide attempts: Dio 69.22.1–4; ''HA Hadrian'' 24.8–13.&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were buried quietly at [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]].&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' 25.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The succession to Antoninus was peaceful and stable: Antoninus kept Hadrian's nominees in office and appeased the senate, respecting its privileges and commuting the death sentences of men charged in Hadrian's last days.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 5.3, 6.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 55–56; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; For his dutiful behavior, Antoninus was asked to accept the name &quot;Pius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 55; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heir to Antoninus Pius, 138–45===
Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 6.2; ''Verus'' 2.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus bolstered Marcus' dignity: Marcus was made consul for 140, with Antoninus as his colleague, and was appointed as a ''seviri'', one of the knights' six commanders, at the order's annual parade on 15 July 139. As the heir apparent, Marcus became ''princeps iuventutis'', head of the equestrian order. He now took the name Caesar: Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.35.5; ''HA Marcus'' 6.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously: &quot;See that you do not turn into a Caesar; do not be dipped into the purple dye—for that can happen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 6.30, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57; cf. ''Marcus Aurelius'', 270 n.9, with notes on the translation.&lt;/ref&gt; At the senate's request, Marcus joined all the priestly colleges (''pontifices'', ''augures'', ''quindecimviri sacris faciundis'', ''septemviri epulonum'', etc.);&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''HA Marcus'' 6.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; direct evidence for membership, however, is available only for the [[Arval Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57, 272 n.10, citing ''Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00032&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.32], [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00379&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.379], cf. ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+00360&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 360].&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus demanded that Marcus take up residence in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Antoninus also made him take up the habits of his new station, the ''aulicum fastigium'' or &quot;pomp of the court&quot;, against Marcus' objections.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings. He told himself it was an attainable goal—&quot;where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 5.16, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt;—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the ''Meditations'' for &quot;abusing court life&quot; in front of company.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 8.9, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

As quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do. He would read imperial letters to the senate when Antoninus was absent, and would do secretarial work for the senators. His duties as consul were more significant: one of two senior representatives of the senate, he would preside over meetings and take a major role in the body's administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt drowned in paperwork, and complained to his tutor, [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]]: &quot;I am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He was being &quot;fitted for ruling the state&quot;, in the words of his biographer.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 6.5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well, making oratorical training essential for the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 145, Marcus was made consul a second time. He might have been unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto that might have been sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep &quot;so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 5.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: &quot;As far as my strength is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...]{{refn|The manuscript is corrupt here.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 89&quot;/&gt;|group=notes}} I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.36.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustina Minor Louvre Ma1144.jpg|thumb|A bust of [[Faustina the Younger]], Marcus' wife ([[Louvre]]).]]
In April 145, Marcus married Faustina, as had been planned since 138. Since Marcus was, by adoption, Antoninus Pius' son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his ''[[Pater familias#Patria potestas|patria potestas]]'') for the ceremony to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been &quot;noteworthy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 10.2, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Unko Aurelius'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fronto and further education, 136–61===
After taking the ''toga virilis'' in 136, Marcus probably began his training in [[Eloquence|oratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three tutors in Greek, Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and [[Herodes Atticus]], and one in Latin, Fronto. The latter two were the most esteemed orators of the day.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 3.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; (Fronto and Atticus, however, probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by Antoninus in 138.) The preponderance of Greek tutors indicates the importance of the language to the aristocracy of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 2.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the age of the [[Second Sophistic]], a renaissance in Greek letters. Although educated in Rome, in his ''Meditations'', Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's ''Marcus Aurelius'', ''Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herodes Atticus - bust - Athens Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|A bust of [[Herodes Atticus]], from his villa at [[Kephissia]] ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]).]]
Herodes was controversial: an enormously rich Athenian (probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger, and resented by his fellow-Athenians for his patronizing manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Sophistae'' 2.1.14; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Atticus was an inveterate opponent of Stoicism and philosophic pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'' 9.2.1–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the Stoics' desire for a &quot;lack of feeling&quot; foolish: they would live a &quot;sluggish, enervated life&quot;, he said.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'' 19.12, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus would become a Stoic. He would not mention Herodes at all in his ''Meditations'', in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto was highly esteemed: in the self-consciously antiquarian world of Latin letters,&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 67–68, citing E. Champlin, ''Fronto and Antonine Rome'' (1980), esp. chs. 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; he was thought of as second only to [[Cicero]], perhaps even an alternative to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Moderns have not offered as positive an assessment. His second modern editor, [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebhur]], thought him stupid and frivolous; his third editor, [[Samuel Adrian Naber|Naber]], found him contemptible.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have seen him as a &quot;pedant and a bore&quot;, his letters offering neither the running political analysis of a Cicero or the conscientious reportage of a Pliny.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Mellor]], review of Edward Champlin's ''Fronto and Antonine Rome'', ''The American Journal of Philology'' 103:4 (1982): 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent prosopographic research has rehabilitated his reputation, though not by much.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g.: Ronald Mellor, review of Edward Champlin's ''Fronto and Antonine Rome'', ''The American Journal of Philology'' 103:4 (1982): 461 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He did not care much for Herodes, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure synonyms, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

A significant amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were very close. &quot;Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are not here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.6 (= Haines 1.80ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.6 (= Haines 1.80ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn &quot;from the lips of Fronto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 3.10–11 (= Haines 1.50ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always suffering&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;—about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, &quot;Chronology of Fronto&quot;, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, &quot;of my own accord with every kind of discomfort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 5.74 ( =Haines 2.52ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto never became Marcus' full-time teacher, and continued his career as an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 77. On the date, see Champlin, &quot;Chronology of Fronto&quot;, 142, who (with Bowersock, ''Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire'' (1964), 93ff) argues for a date in the 150s; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 78–79, 273 n.17 (with Ameling, ''Herodes Atticus'' (1983), 1.61ff, 2.30ff) argues for 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with &quot;advice&quot;, then as a &quot;favor&quot;, not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 3.2 (= Haines 1.58ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), allowed that Marcus might be correct,&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 3.3 (= Haines 1.62ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary: &quot;...the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 3.3 (= Haines 1.62ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the trial is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the age of twenty-five (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in jurisprudence, and showed some signs of general malaise. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an unpleasant blowhard, and had made &quot;a hit at&quot; him: &quot;It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to ''be'' a judge is noble work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.13 (= Haines 1.214ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.3.1 (= Haines 1.2ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Marcus' formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. It &quot;affected his health adversely&quot;, his biographer writes, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. It was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in Marcus' entire boyhood.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 3.5–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto had warned Marcus against the study of philosophy early on: &quot;it is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy...than to have tasted it superficially, with the edge of the lips, as the saying is&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.3, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 69&quot;/&gt; Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' &quot;conversion to philosophy&quot;: &quot;in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work&quot;, Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training.&lt;ref&gt;''De Eloquentia'' 4.5 (= Haines 2.74), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 95. Alan Cameron, in his review of Birley's biography (''The Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): 347), suggests a reference to chapter 11 of Arthur Darby Nock's ''Conversion'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933, rept. 1961): &quot;Conversion to Philosophy&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 94, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollonius may have introduced Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but [[Junius Rusticus|Quintus Junius Rusticus]] would have the strongest influence on the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 95; Champlin, ''Fronto'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Champlin notes that Marcus' praise of him in the ''Meditations'' is out of order (he is praised immediately after Diognetus, who had introduced Marcus to philosophy), giving him special emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', 174 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He was the man Fronto recognized as having &quot;wooed Marcus away&quot; from oratory.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.36), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; He was twenty years older than Marcus, older than Fronto. As the grandson of [[Arulenus Rusticus]], one of the martyrs to the tyranny of [[Domitian]] (''r''. 81–96), he was heir to the tradition of &quot;Stoic opposition&quot; to the &quot;bad emperors&quot; of the 1st century;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 94–95, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; the true successor of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (as opposed to Fronto, the false one).&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks Rusticus for teaching him &quot;not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts...To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Births and deaths, 147–160===
On November 30, 147, Faustina gave birth to a girl, named Domitia Faustina. She was the first of at least thirteen children (including two sets of twins) that Faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Antoninus Pius gave Marcus the [[tribune|tribunician]] power and the ''[[imperium]]''—authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, Marcus had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four Antoninus could introduce. His tribunican powers would be renewed, with Antoninus', on 10 December 147.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RomaCastelSantAngelo-2.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where the children of Marcus and Faustina were buried.]]
The first mention of Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals her as a sickly infant. &quot;Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery. The diarrhea has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing.&quot; He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been &quot;pretty occupied&quot; with the girl's care.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.11 (= Haines 1.202ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Domitia would die in 151.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 247 F.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 149, Faustina gave birth again, to twin sons. Contemporary coinage commemorates the event, with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys, and the legend ''temporum felicitas'', &quot;the happiness of the times&quot;. They did not survive long. Before the end of the year, another family coin was issued: it shows only a tiny girl, Domitia Faustina, and one boy baby. Then another: the girl alone. The infants were buried in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where their epitaphs survive. They were called Titus Aurelius Antoninus and Tiberius Aelius Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus steadied himself: &quot;One man prays: 'How I may not lose my little child', but you must pray: 'How I may not be afraid to lose him'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 9.40, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 207.&lt;/ref&gt; He quoted from the ''[[Iliad]]'' what he called the &quot;briefest and most familiar saying...enough to dispel sorrow and fear&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;                                                        leaves,
the wind scatters some on the face of the ground;
like unto them are the children of men.&lt;/poem&gt;
–&amp;nbsp;''Iliad'' 6.146&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 10.34, tr. Farquharson, 78, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another daughter was born on 7 March 150, [[Lucilla|Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla]]. At some time between 155 and 161, probably soon after 155, Marcus' mother, Domitia Lucilla, died.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, might not have been born until 153.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152. A coin issue celebrates ''fecunditati Augustae'', &quot;the Augusta's fertility&quot;, depicting two girls and an infant. The boy did not survive long; on coins from 156, only the two girls were depicted. He might have died in 152, the same year as Marcus' sister, Cornificia.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 28 March 158, however, when Marcus replied, the child was dead, Marcus thanked the temple synod, &quot;even though this turned out otherwise&quot;. The child's name is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Graecae ad Res Romanas pertinentes'' 4.1399, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In 159 and 160, Faustina gave birth to daughters: Fadilla, after one of Faustina's dead sisters, and Cornificia, after Marcus' dead sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114&quot;&gt;Birley, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antoninus Pius' last years, 152–61===
[[File:Antoninus Pius Glyptothek Munich 337 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Antoninus Pius]], Marcus' adoptive father and predecessor as emperor (Glyptothek).]]
Meanwhile, during the reign of Pius, as a prince and future emperor, Marcus' adoptive brother Lucius Verus received careful education from the famous “grammaticus” [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]]. The young Verus was reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Lucius started his political career as a [[quaestor]] in 153, two years before the legal age of 25 (Marcus held the office at 17). In 154, he was [[consul]], nine years before the legal age of 32 (Marcus held the office at 18 and 23), and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.

Lucius had no other titles, except that of &quot;son of Augustus&quot;. Lucius had a markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds, but especially hunting and wrestling; he took obvious pleasure in the circus games and gladiatorial fights.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although part of the biographer's account of Lucius is fictionalized (probably to mimic Nero, whose birthday Lucius shared&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 6.1; ''HA Verus'' 1.8; Barnes, 67; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 158. See also: Barnes, 69–70; Pierre Lambrechts, &quot;L'empereur Lucius Verus. Essai de réhabilitation&quot; (in French), ''Antiquité Classique'' 3 (1934), 173ff.&lt;/ref&gt;), and another part poorly compiled from a better biographical source,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 66. Poorly compiled: e.g. Barnes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars have accepted these biographical details as accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He did not marry until 164.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Barnes, 68; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still when he became the [[praetorian prefect]] (an office that was as much secretarial as military) Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114&quot;/&gt;

Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at [[Lorium]], in [[Etruria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; about twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 15:7&quot;&gt;Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.33.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password—&quot;aequanimitas&quot; (equanimity).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 532&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 532&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 12.4–8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus, surpassing [[Tiberius]] by a couple of months.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Emperorship of Marcus Aurelius}}

===Accession of Marcus and Lucius, 161===
After the death of Antoninus Pius, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow. The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title ''[[imperator]]'', and he would soon be formally elected as ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was &quot;compelled&quot; to take imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.5, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a genuine ''horror imperii'', &quot;fear of imperial power&quot;. Marcus, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear.

Although Marcus showed no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his ''Meditations''), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 3.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The senate accepted, granting Lucius the ''imperium'', the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.1; ''Marcus'' 7.5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|These name-swaps have proven so confusing that even the ''Historia Augusta'', our main source for the period, cannot keep them straight.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] shows even more confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The mistaken belief that Lucius had the name &quot;Verus&quot; before becoming emperor has proven especially popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117&quot;/&gt;{{refn|There was, however, much precedent. The consulate was a twin magistracy, and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices (under Antoninus, the lieutenant had been Marcus). Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the past—[[Augustus]] planned to leave [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Lucius Caesar]] as joint emperors on his death; Tiberius wished to have [[Gaius Caligula]] and [[Tiberius Gemellus]] do so as well; [[Claudius]] left the empire to [[Nero]] and [[Britannicus]], imagining that they would accept equal rank—but all of these arrangements had ended in failure, either through premature death (Gaius and Lucius Caesar) or judicial murder (Gemellus by Caligula and Britannicus by Nero).&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117&quot;/&gt;|group=notes}}

In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more ''[[auctoritas]]'', or &quot;authority&quot;, than Lucius. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Antoninus' administration, and he alone was ''Pontifex Maximus''. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 117&quot;/&gt; As the biographer wrote, &quot;Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117, 278 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the [[Castra Praetoria]], the camp of the [[Praetorian Guard|praetorian guard]]. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as ''imperatores''. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.9; ''Verus'' 4.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]] (5,000 [[denarius|denarii]]) per capita, with more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.9; ''Verus'' 4.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117–18. &quot;twice the size&quot;: Richard Duncan-Jones, ''Structure and Scale in the Roman Economy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his accession he also devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 83.5% to 79%—the silver weight dropping from 2.68&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.57&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=&quot;TulaneUniversity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |title=Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot; |publisher=Tulane.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marcus would later revisit the issue of currency reform.

Antoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, &quot;elaborate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118, 278 n.6.&lt;/ref&gt; If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the [[Campus Martius]], while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A ''[[flamen]]'', or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now ''Divus Antoninus''. Antoninus Pius' remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]]. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118&quot;/&gt;

In accordance with his will, Antoninus' fortune passed on to Faustina.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 12.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt;) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Comm''. 1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August she gave birth at [[Lanuvium]] to twins: T.

Soon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118, citing Werner Eck, ''Die Organization Italiens'' (1979), 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their ''civiliter'' (&quot;lacking pomp&quot;) behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, &quot;No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ''ab epistulis'' Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of Pannonia and had served in the war in Mauretania. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 122–23, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, ''Roman Britain and the Roman Army'' (1953), 142ff., 151ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus' former tutor, had been [[Augustal prefect|prefectural governor]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] at Marcus' accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (''[[Aerarium|aerarium Saturni]]''). He was made consul soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), no. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto's son-in-law, Aufidius Victorinus, was appointed governor of [[Germania Superior|Upper Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HA Marcus 8 1985&quot;&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, citing W. Eck, ''Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen'' (1985), 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in [[Cirta]] as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 1.3.2 (= Haines 1.298ff).&lt;/ref&gt; The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: &quot;There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 4.2.3 (= Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120&quot;&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiber in flood 2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tiber Island]] seen at a forty-year high-water mark of the Tiber, December 2008.]]
Lucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 1.1 (= Haines 1.305).&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus told Fronto of his reading—[[Lucius Coelius Antipater|Coelius]] and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for &quot;some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus—or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 4.1 (= Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, Marcus would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the ''felicitas temporum'' (&quot;happy times&quot;) that the coinage of 161 had so glibly proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 162,{{refn|Because both Verus and Marcus are said to have taken active part in the recovery (''HA Marcus'' 8.4–5), the flood must have happened before Verus' departure for the east in 162; because it appears in the biographer's narrative after Antoninus' funeral has finished and the emperors have settled into their offices, it must not have occurred in the spring of 161. A date in autumn 161 or spring 162 is probable, and, given the normal seasonal distribution of Tiber flooding, the most probable date is in spring 162.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Aldrete, ''Floods of the Tiber in ancient Rome'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; (Birley dates the flood to autumn 161.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 120&quot;/&gt;)|group=notes}} the [[Tiber]] overflowed its banks, flooding much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Since 15 CE, the river had been administered by a Tiber Conservancy Board, with a consular senator at its head and a permanent staff. In 161, the ''curator alevi Tiberis et riparum et cloacarum urbis'' (&quot;Curator of the Tiber Bed and Banks and the City Sewers&quot;) was A. Platorius Nepos, son or grandson of [[Aulus Platorius Nepos|the builder]] of [[Hadrian's Wall]], whose name he shares. He probably had not been particularly incompetent. A more likely candidate for that incompetence is Nepos' likely predecessor, [[Marcus Statius Priscus|M. Statius Priscus]]. A military man and consul for 159, Priscus probably looked on the office as little more than &quot;paid leave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+05932&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 5932] (Nepos), [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01092&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1092] (Priscus); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 11.3, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 278 n.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was &quot;beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: &quot;Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of [[Cleanthes]] and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De eloquentia'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.63–65), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at [[Cyzicus]]. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: &quot;not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech&quot;. Fronto was hugely pleased.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.4 (= Haines 2.41–43), tr. Haines; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origins to Lucius' dispatch, 161–62====
On his deathbed, Antoninus Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 12.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; One of those kings, [[Vologases IV of Parthia]], made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.&lt;ref&gt;Event: ''HA Marcus'' 8.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.

Convinced by the prophet [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself,&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 27; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121–22. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Severianus led a legion (perhaps the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX Hispana]]&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 278 n.19.&lt;/ref&gt;) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 21, 24, 25; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coin of Vologases IV of Parthia.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of [[Vologases IV]], king of Parthia, from 152/53.]]
There was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in [[Raetia]] and [[Germania Superior|Upper Germany]], where the [[Chatti]] of the [[Taunus]] mountains had recently crossed over the ''limes''.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was unprepared.

More bad news arrived: the Syrian governor's army had been defeated by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding [[Legio X Gemina|X Gemina]] at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+08,+07050&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 8.7050]–[http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+08,+07051&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 51]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Three full legions were also sent east: [[Legio I Minervia|I Minervia]] from Bonn in Upper Germany,&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01097&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1097]–[http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 98]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legio II Adiutrix|II Adiutrix]] from Aquincum,&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01091&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1091]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legio V Macedonica|V Macedonica]] from Troesmis.&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+02311&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 2311]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annius Libo, Marcus' first cousin, was sent to replace the Syrian governor.

Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 9.2; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus took a four-day public holiday at [[Alsium]], a resort town on the coast of [[Etruria]]. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 1 (= Haines 2.3); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto replied ironically: &quot;What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.1 (= Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Antoninus had enjoyed exercise in the ''[[palaestra]]'', fishing, and comedy),&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.4 (= Haines 2.9); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.6–12 (= Haines 2.11–19); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. &quot;I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,&quot; he wrote back.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 4, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: &quot;'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!&quot; He had rested, and would rest often, but &quot;—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 4 (= Haines 2.19), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material,&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 10 (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled ''De bello Parthico'' (''On the Parthian War''). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes,&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 1–2 (= Haines 2.21–23).&lt;/ref&gt; but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: &quot;always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lucius at Antioch, 162–65====

Warren from a sketch by Captain [[Thomas Byam Martin|Byam Martin]], R.N., 1866)]]
Over the winter of 161–62, as more bad news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 5.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Birley believes there is some truth in these considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city &quot;demanded the presence of an emperor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.9, tr. Magie; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123–26. On Lucius' voyage, see: ''HA Verus'' 6.7–9; ''HA Marcus'' 8.10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at [[Laodicea in Syria|Laodicea]] and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics declaimed Lucius' luxurious lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken to gambling, they said; he would &quot;dice the whole night through&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.6, tr.

In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to [[Ephesus]] to be married to Marcus' daughter Lucilla.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; ''Marcus'' 9.4; Barnes, 72; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163; cf. also Barnes, &quot;Legislation Against the Christians&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58:1–2 (1968), 39; &quot;Some Persons in the Historia Augusta&quot;, ''Phoenix'' 26:2 (1972), 142, citing the ''Vita Abercii'' 44ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus moved up the date; perhaps he had already heard of Lucius' mistress, the low-born and beautiful Panthea.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.10; Lucian, ''Imagines'' 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131. Cf. Lucian, ''Imagines'', ''Pro Imaginibus'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; ''Marcus'' 9.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Civica was made ''[[comes]] Augusti'', &quot;companion of the emperors&quot;; perhaps Marcus wanted him to watch over Lucius, the job Libo had failed at.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131, citing ''Anné Épigraphique'' 1958.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus only accompanied the group as far as [[Brundisium]], where they boarded a ship for the east.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.5–6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Counterattack and victory, 163–66====
The Armenian capital [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artaxata]] was captured in 163.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.1; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the year, Verus took the title ''Armeniacus'', despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.1; ''HA Verus'' 7.1–2; ''Ad Verrum Imperator'' 2.3 (= Haines 2.133); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; When Lucius was hailed as ''imperator'' again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the ''Imperator II'' with him.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 233ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArRaqqahEuphrates.jpg|310px|thumb|right|The Euphrates river near [[Ar-Raqqah]], Syria.]]
Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), replaced Artaxata.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.3.1; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162; Millar, ''Near East'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Gaius Julius Sohaemus]]. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 280 n. 42; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend {{Smallcaps|Rex armeniis Datus}}: Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 163, the Parthians intervened in [[Osroene]], a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], and installed their own king on its throne.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, 279 n. 38; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169; Millar, ''Near East'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.&lt;ref&gt;Fronto, ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town southwest of Edessa.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1098]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 15, 19; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 20, 28; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing Syme, ''Roman Papers'', 5.689ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: [[Seleucia]] on the right bank of the Tigris and [[Ctesiphon]] on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Diadochi|successor kingdoms]]), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 8.3–4; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, ''Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), 124ff., on the date.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as ''imperatores'' again, earning the title 'imp. III'.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 384 ff., 1248 ff., 1271 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title 'Medicus',&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing P. Kneissl, ''Die Siegestitulatur der römischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts'' (Göttingen, 1969), 99 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperors were again hailed as ''imperatores'', becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conclusion of the war and events at Rome, mid-160s–167====
[[File:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|thumb|200px|A bust of Marcus Aurelius, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York]].]]
Most of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals, the most prominent of which was [[Avidius Cassius|C. Avidius Cassius]], [[Legatus legionis|commander]] of [[Legio III Gallica|III Gallica]], one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was a young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus]]. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ''ab epistulis'', followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, ''passim''; Syme, ''Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia'' 1984 (= ''Roman Papers'' IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?).&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius and his fellow commander in the war, Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing Alföldy, ''Konsulat'', 24, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Rome, Marcus was occupied with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. However, her will was invalid under the ''lex Falcidia'': Matidia had assigned more than three-quarters of her estate to non-relatives. This was because many of her clients were included in [[Codicil (will)|codicils]] to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but as she was dying, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case, but Marcus demurred, saying his brother would make the final decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 2.1–2 (= Haines 2.94ff.); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Champlin dates these letters to either summer 162 or early 165.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', 134.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

On the return from the campaign, Lucius was awarded with a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; the parade was unusual because it included the two emperors, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, [[Commodus]], five years old, and Annius Verus, three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion.

The returning army carried with them a plague, afterwards known as the [[Antonine Plague]], or the Plague of [[Galen]], which spread through the Roman Empire between 165 and 180. The disease was a [[pandemic]] believed to be either of [[smallpox]] or [[measles]], and would ultimately claim the lives of two [[Roman emperors]]—[[Lucius Verus]], who died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius, whose family name, Antoninus, was given to the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]], and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day at Rome, one-quarter of those infected. Total deaths have been estimated at five million.

A possible contact with [[Han Dynasty|Han China]] occurred in 166 when a [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman traveller visited the Han court]], claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[Wiktionary:安|安]][[Wiktionary:敦|敦]]), who can be identified either with Marcus Aurelius or his predecessor Antoninus Pius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/605541 |last=Pulleyblank |first=Edwin G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |last2=Leslie |month=  |first2=D.

===Legal and administrative work, 161–80===
Like many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes;&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;AD 337'' (London: Duckworth, 1977), 6 and ''passim''. See also: idem. &quot;Emperors at Work&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1/2 (1967): 9–19.&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pius, one of longest-serving emperors, became infirm in his last years, so Marcus Aurelius gradually assumed the imperial duties. By the time he succeeded in AD 161, he was already well-practised in public administration.&quot;  This quote is from philosopher [[Iain King]], writing about Aurelius in [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm  Thinkers At War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcus took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him &quot;an emperor most skilled in the law&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 7.2.6, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 31.67.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows marked interest in three areas of the law: the manumission of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (''decuriones'').&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 168 he revalued the [[denarius]], increasing the silver purity from 79% to 82% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.57&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.67&amp;nbsp;grams. However, two years later Marcus reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;TulaneUniversity&quot; /&gt;

===War with Germanic tribes 166–180===
:''For details, see: [[Marcomannic Wars]]''

[[File:Aurelius180AD.png|thumb|500px|The Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. His annexation of lands of the Marcomanni and the Jazyges – perhaps to be provincially called [[Marcomannia]] and Sarmatia&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 253&lt;/ref&gt; – was cut short in 175 by the revolt of Avidius Cassius and in 180 by his death.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, 183&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Dio 72.11.3–4; ''Ad amicos'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.173); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 72.11.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 132, citing ''De nepote amisso'' 2 (= Haines 2.222); ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.9–10 (= Haines 2.232ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. L. Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced M. Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Ti. Haterius Saturnius. M. Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133, citing Geza Alföldy, ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand'' (1977), Moesia Inferior: 232 f.; Moesia Superior: 234f.; Pannonia Superior: 236f.; Dacia: 245f.; Pannonia Inferior: 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 160s, [[Germanic tribes]] and other nomadic people launched raids along the [[limes Germanicus|northern border]], particularly into [[Gaul]] and across the [[Danube#Human history|Danube]]. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion of the [[Chatti]] in the province of [[Germania Superior]] was repulsed in 162.

Far more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the [[Marcomanni]] of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since 19, crossed the Danube together with the [[Lombards]] and other Germanic tribes. At the same time, the Iranian [[Sarmatians]] attacked between the Danube and the [[Tisza|Theiss]] rivers.

Due to the situation in the East, only a [[punitive expedition]] could be launched in 167. Both Marcus and Verus led the troops. After the death of Verus (169), Marcus led personally the struggle against the Germanic tribes for the great part of his remaining life. The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the [[Quadi]] and Marcomanni, who could cross the Alps, ravage ''Opitergium'' ([[Oderzo]]) and besiege [[Aquileia]], the main Roman city of north-east Italy.

At the same time the [[Costoboci]], coming from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] area, invaded [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like [[Dacia]], [[Pannonia]], Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and [[Marcomannia]], including today's Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Some Germanic tribes who settled in [[Ravenna]] revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius''&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor's plans were, however, prevented by a revolt in East, led by Avidius Cassius, which was prompted by false news of the death of Marcus after an illness. Of the eastern provinces, only [[Cappadocia]] and [[Bithynia]] did not side with the rebels. When it became clear that Marcus Aurelius was still alive, Cassius' fortunes declined quickly and he was killed by his troops after only 100 days of power.

Together with his wife Faustina, Marcus Aurelius toured the eastern provinces until 173. He visited Athens, declaring himself a protector of philosophy. After a triumph in Rome, the following year he marched again to the Danubian frontier. After a decisive victory in 178, the plan to annex [[Moravia]] and [[West Slovakia]]  seemed poised for success but was abandoned after Marcus Aurelius again fell ill in 180.

===Death and succession 180===
[[Image:0 Marcus Aurelius - Piazza del Campidoglio (3).JPG|thumb|right|Bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius, [[piazza del Campidoglio]] in [[Rome]].]]
[[File:Equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, Rome.jpg|thumb|left|Equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, Rome]]

Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern [[Vienna]]). He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to [[Rome]], and rested in [[Hadrian]]'s [[mausoleum]] (modern [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]) until the [[Visigoth]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of the city]] in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|column]] and a [[temple of Marcus Aurelius|temple]] built in [[Rome]].

Marcus gave the succession to his son [[Commodus]], whom he had named Caesar in 166 and made co-emperor in 177. This decision, putting an end to the series of &quot;adoptive emperors&quot;, was highly criticized by later historians since Commodus was a political and military outsider, as well as an extreme egotist with neurotic problems.

At the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an [[encomium]] to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus, to Dio's own times, with sorrow.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.
:–Cassius Dio 71.36.3–4&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Cary, ''ad loc''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Michael Grant, in ''The Climax of Rome'' (1968),&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Grant|title=The Climax Of Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXc1uk30FIYC|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-78022-276-9|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes of Commodus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The youth turned out to be very erratic, or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy and reputation==
Marcus Aurelius acquired the reputation of a [[philosopher king]] within his lifetime, and the title would remain his after death; both Dio and the biographer call him &quot;the philosopher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 1.1, 27.7; Dio 71.1.1; James Francis, ''Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World'' (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 21 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians—[[Justin Martyr]], Athenagoras, Melito—gave him the title, too.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 21 n.1, citing Justin, ''1 Apologia'' 1; Athenagoras, ''Leg''. 1; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The last named went so far as to call Marcus &quot;more philanthropic and philosophic&quot; than Antoninus Pius and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11, qtd. and tr. Francis, 21 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Alone of the emperors,&quot; wrote the historian Herodian, &quot;he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Ab Excessu Divi Marci'' 1.2.4, tr. Echols.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iain King]] concludes Marcus Aurelius' legacy is tragic, because the emperor's &quot;Stoic philosophy – which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others – was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This is the conclusion of [[Iain King|King's]] biography of Aurelius, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm Thinker at War], published August 2014, accessed November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1964 movie ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' he was portrayed by [[Alec Guinness]] and in the 2000 movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' he was portrayed by [[Richard Harris]].  Both movie plots posited that Marcus Aurelius was assassinated because he intended to pass down power to Aurelius' adopted son, a Roman general, instead of his biological son Commodus.

Entertainer, Marcus Orelias coined his name after the Roman emperor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orelias|first1=Marcus|title=Marcus Orelias - Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5953882/bio?ref_=nm_dyk_trv_sm#trivia|website=IMDb.com|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; his debut album cover also featured Marcus Aurelius (as Caesar) on a gold coin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orelias|first1=Marcus|title=Marcus Orelias - Album of the Year|url=http://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/15775-marcus-orelias-rebel-of-the-underground.php|website=albumoftheyear.org|publisher=Album of the Year|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed during the emperor's reign from 139 to 180 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nomisma|first1=Wikipedia|title=Roman Coins|url=https://finds.org.uk/romancoins/emperors/emperor/id/19|website=Finds.org|publisher=Finds.org|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitude towards Christians==
In the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was local Roman officials who were largely responsible for persecution of Christians. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy D. Barnes, &quot;Legislation Against the Christians,&quot; Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 58 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLynn|first=Frank|title=Marcus Aurelius: A Life|date=2009|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0306818302|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gibbon with the onset of the Germanic war, his treatment of the Christians degraded with increased persecutions uncharacteristic of the previous years of his reign, and those of his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire — Volume 2 by Edward Gibbon Ch. 16 Pt. 5|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/732?msg=welcome_stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
While on campaign between 170 and 180, Aurelius wrote his ''[[Meditations]]'' in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The title of this work was added posthumously—originally he titled his work simply: &quot;To Myself&quot;. He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and spirituality. ''[[Meditations]]'' is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. The book has been a favourite of [[Frederick the Great]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Goethe]], [[Wen Jiabao]], and [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays. Introduction to Marcus Aurelius Meditations Weidenfeld and Nicholson London2003 pxlix&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how far Marcus' writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and [[Julian the Apostate]] was well aware of Marcus' reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;Stertz, 434, citing Themistius, ''Oratio'' 6.81; ''HA Cassius'' 3.5; Aurelius Victor, ''De Caesaribus'' 16.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The book itself, though mentioned in correspondence by [[Arethas of Caesarea]] in the 10th century and in the Byzantine [[Suda]], was first published in 1558 in Zurich by Wilhelm Holzmann, from a manuscript copy that is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays. Introduction to Marcus Aurelius Meditations Weidenfeld and Nicholson London 2003 pp xlviii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only other surviving complete copy of the manuscript is in the [[Vatican library]].

'''Lucius Verus''' ({{lang-la|{{sc|lvcivs avrelivs vervs avgvstvs}}}}; 15 December 130 – 169) was the [[Roman Emperor]] from 161 to 169. Born '''Lucius&amp;nbsp;Ceionius Commodus''', with the same name as his father, he became '''Lucius&amp;nbsp;Aelius Commodus''' when the latter was adopted by Hadrian, since both father and son had to change their names accordingly.  When he was adopted by Caesar [[Antoninus Pius]] in February 138, his name was changed to '''[[Lucius (praenomen)|L.]]&amp;nbsp;Aelius Aurelius Commodus'''. His name changed again following his ascension in 161. He ruled together with his adoptive brother [[Marcus Aurelius]] as co-emperor from 161 until his own death in 169. During his reign, the [[Roman Empire]] defeated a revitalized [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] in the east: Verus's general, [[Avidius Cassius]], sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]], in 164. He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the [[Roman Senate]] as the Divine Verus (''Divus Verus'').

==Early life and career==
[[File:Lucius Verus child Louvre Ma1149.jpg|thumb|left|Lucius Verus as a child.]]
[[File:Lucius Verus Denarius.jpg|thumb|250px||[[Denarius]] of Lucius Verus]]

Lucius Verus was the first-born son to [[Avidia Plautia]] and [[Lucius Aelius]] Caesar, the first adopted son and heir of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] (76–138). He was born and raised in Rome. Verus had another brother, Gaius Avidius Ceionius Commodus, and two sisters, [[Ceionia Fabia]] and [[Ceionia Plautia]]. His maternal grandparents were the Roman senator, [[Gaius Avidius Nigrinus]], and the unattested noblewoman Ignota Plautia. Although his adoptive paternal grandparent was the Roman Emperor Hadrian, his biological paternal grandparents were the consul Lucius Ceionius Commodus and noblewoman Aelia or Fundania Plautia.

When his father died in early 138, Hadrian chose Antoninus Pius (86–161) as his successor. Antoninus was adopted by Hadrian on the condition that Verus and Hadrian’s great-nephew Marcus Aurelius were to be adopted by Antoninus as his sons and heirs.

By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive son through his new father.  The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son.

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus's betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 6.2; ''Verus'' 2.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a prince and future emperor, Verus received careful education from the famous ''grammaticus'' [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]]. He was reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Verus started his political career as a [[quaestor]] in 153, became [[consul]] in 154, and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.

Antoninus died on 7 March 161, and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. Although Marcus had no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his ''Meditations''), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 3.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The senate accepted, granting Lucius the ''imperium'', the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.1; ''Marcus'' 7.5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus's family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|These name-swaps have proven so confusing that even the ''Historia Augusta'', the main source for the period, cannot keep them straight.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth-century ecclesiastical historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] shows even more confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The mistaken belief that Lucius had the name &quot;Verus&quot; before becoming emperor has proven especially popular.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|There was, however, much precedent. The consulate was a twin magistracy, and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices (under Pius, the lieutenant had been Marcus). Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the past—[[Augustus]] planned to leave [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Lucius Caesar]] as joint emperors on his death; Tiberius wished to have [[Gaius Caligula]] and [[Tiberius Gemellus]] do so as well; [[Claudius]] left the empire to [[Nero]] and [[Britannicus]], imagining that they would accept equal rank—but all of these arrangements had ended in failure, either through premature death (Gaius and Lucius Caesar) or judicial murder (Gemellus by Caligula and Britannicus by Nero).&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more ''[[auctoritas]]'', or authority, than Verus. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Pius' administration, and he alone was ''Pontifex Maximus''. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt; As the biographer wrote, &quot;Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117, 278 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the [[Castra Praetoria]], the camp of the [[Praetorian Guard|praetorian guard]]. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as ''imperatores''. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.9; ''Verus'' 4.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]] (5,000 [[denarius|denarii]]) per capita, more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.9; ''Verus'' 4.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 117–18. &quot;twice the size&quot;: Richard Duncan-Jones, ''Structure and Scale in the Roman Economy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius's funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, &quot;elaborate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118, 278 n.6.&lt;/ref&gt; If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the [[Campus Martius]], while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Pius's campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[flamen]]'', or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius, now ''Divus Antoninus''. Pius's remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus's children and of Hadrian himself.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]]. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early rule, 161–62===
Soon after the emperors' accession, Marcus's eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 7.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 118, citing Werner Eck, ''Die Organisation Italiens'' (1979), 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their ''civiliter'' (lacking pomp) behavior.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperors permitted free speech, evinced by the fact that the comedy writer [[Marullus]] was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, &quot;No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in [[Cirta]] as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 1.3.2 (= Haines 1.298ff).&lt;/ref&gt; The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: &quot;There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 4.2.3 (= Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 1.1 (= Haines 1.305).&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus told Fronto of his reading—[[Lucius Coelius Antipater|Coelius]] and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt [[Matidia Minor]]; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 4.1 (= Haines 1.300ff), ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperors' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Some minor troubles cropped up in the spring; there would be more later. In the spring of 162,{{#tag:ref|Because both Verus and Marcus are said to have taken active part in the recovery (''HA Marcus'' 8.4–5), the flood must have happened before Verus's departure for the east in 162; because it appears in the biographer's narrative after Pius' funeral has finished and the emperors have settled into their offices, it must not have occurred in the spring of 161. A date in autumn 161 or spring 162 is probable, and, given the normal seasonal distribution of Tiber flooding, the most probable date is in spring 162.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Aldrete, ''Floods of the Tiber in ancient Rome'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; (Birley dates the flood to autumn 161).&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} the [[Tiber]] flooded over its banks, destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Since 15 CE, the river had been administered by a Tiber conservancy board, with a consular senator at its head and a permanent staff.

Platorius Nepos, son or grandson of [[Aulus Platorius Nepos|the builder]] of [[Hadrian's Wall]], whose name he shares. He probably had not been particularly incompetent. A more likely candidate for that incompetence is Nepos' likely predecessor, [[Marcus Statius Priscus|M. Statius Priscus]]. A military man and consul for 159, Priscus probably looked on the office as little more than &quot;paid leave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+05932&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 5932] (Nepos), [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01092&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1092] (Priscus); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 11.3, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 278 n.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Parthia, 161–66===
:''For details, see: [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–66]]. See also: [[Roman–Persian Wars]]''

====Origins to Lucius's dispatch, 161–62====
On his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Pius'' 12.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 114, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; One of those kings, [[Vologases IV of Parthia]], made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.&lt;ref&gt;Event: ''HA Marcus'' 8.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121. Date: Jaap-Jan Flinterman, &quot;The Date of Lucian's Visit to Abonuteichos,&quot; ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 119 (1997): 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Vologases entered the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—[[Bakur|Pacorus]], an [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] like himself.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the invasion, the Governor of Syria was L. Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his replacement. The Governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was [[Marcus Sedatius Severianus]], a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 27; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severianus had fallen under the influence of [[Alexander of Abonutichus]], a self-proclaimed prophet who carried a snake named [[Glycon]] around with him, but was really only a confidence man.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Abonutichus was father-in-law to the respected senator P. Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, then-proconsul of Asia, and friends with many members of the east Roman elite.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 30; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Abonutichus convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 27; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severianus led a legion (perhaps the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX Hispana]])&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 278 n.19.&lt;/ref&gt; into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general, Chosrhoes, at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 21, 24, 25; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in [[Raetia]] and [[Germania Superior|Upper Germany]], where the [[Chatti]] of the [[Taunus]] mountains had recently crossed over the ''limes''.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius's twenty-three-year reign at his emperor's side—and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Pius'' 7.11; ''Marcus'' 7.2; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 103–4, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] adduces the fifth-century writer [[Sidonius Apollinaris]]'s comment that Marcus commanded &quot;countless legions&quot; ''vivente Pio'' (while Pius was alive) while contesting Birley's contention that Marcus had no military experience. (Neither Apollinaris nor the ''Historia Augusta'' (Birley's source) are particularly reliable on second-century history).&lt;ref&gt;''Pan. Ath.'' 203–4, qtd. and tr. Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's ''Marcus Aurelius'', ''The Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): 349.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Marcus made the necessary appointments: [[Marcus Statius Priscus]], the Governor of Britain, was sent to replace Severianus as Governor of Cappadocia.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, citing A.R. Birley, ''The'' Fasti ''of Roman Britain'' (1981), 123ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sextus Calpurnius Agricola]] took Priscus's former office.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, citing W. Eck, ''Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen'' (1985), 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Strategic emergency =====
More news arrived: Attidius Cornelianus's army had been defeated in battle against the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding [[Legio X Gemina|X Gemina]] at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+08,+07050&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 8.7050]–[http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+08,+07051&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 51]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Three full legions were also sent east: [[Legio I Minervia|I Minervia]] from Bonn in Upper Germany,&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01097&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1097]–[http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 98]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legio II Adiutrix|II Adiutrix]] from Aquincum,&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01091&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1091]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legio V Macedonica|V Macedonica]] from Troesmis.&lt;ref&gt;''Incriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+02311&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 2311]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 12.13; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Attidius Cornelianus himself was replaced by  M. Annius Libo, Marcus's first cousin. He was young—his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties&lt;ref&gt;''L'Année Épigraphique'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=AE+1972,+00657&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1972.657]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;—and, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 9.2; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus took a four-day public holiday at [[Alsium]], a resort town on the [[Etruria]]n coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 1 (= Haines 2.3); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto replied ironically: &quot;What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.1 (= Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the ''[[palaestra]]'', fishing, and comedy),&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.4 (= Haines 2.9); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.6–12 (= Haines 2.11–19); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. &quot;I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,&quot; he wrote back.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 4, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: &quot;'Much good has my advice done you', you will say.&quot; He had rested, and would rest often, but &quot;—this devotion to duty. Who knows better than you how demanding it is?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 4 (= Haines 2.19), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, including Cicero's ''pro lege Manilia'', in which the orator had argued in favor of [[Pompey]] taking supreme command in the [[Third Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]]. It was an apt reference (Pompey's war had taken him to Armenia), and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels, concerning the choice of army commanders, the interests of allies, the protection of provinces, the discipline of the soldiers, the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere [...]{{#tag:ref|The text breaks off here.&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 10 (= Haines 2.31).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 10 (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; To settle his unease over the course of the Parthian War, Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled ''De bello Parthico'' (''On the Parthian War''). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes, at [[Battle of the Allia|Allia]], at [[Battle of the Caudine Forks|Caudium]], at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], at [[Siege of Numantia|Numantia]], [[Siege of Cirta|Cirta]], and [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]];&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 1 (= Haines 2.21).&lt;/ref&gt; under Trajan, Hadrian, and Pius;&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 2 (= Haines 2.21–23); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: &quot;always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lucius's dispatch and journey east, 162–63?====
Over the winter of 161–62, as more troubling news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian War in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius's biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius's debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 5.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 123, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Birley believes there is some truth in these considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left.

Furius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, M. Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and M. Iallius Bassus, and part of the praetorian guard.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125, citing H.G.

Laelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and Governor of Syria in 153; thus he had first-hand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made ''[[comes]] Augustorum'' (&quot;companion of the emperors&quot;) for his service.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01094&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1094], [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01100&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1100]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Laelianus was, in the words of Fronto, &quot;a serious man and an old-fashioned disciplinarian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.6 (= Haines 2.84ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassus had been Governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made ''comes''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus,&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 8.6, 9.3–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as ''praefectus vehiculorum'' to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain I–III'' (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), no. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Classis Misenensis|fleet of Misenum]] was charged with transporting the Emperor and general communications and transport.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125, citing C.G. Starr, ''The Roman Imperial Navy'', (1941), 188ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from [[Brundisium]]; Marcus followed him as far as [[Capua]]. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at [[Apulia]]. He fell ill at [[Canosa di Puglia|Canosa]], probably afflicted with a stroke, and took to bed.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 6.7–9; ''HA Marcus'' 8.10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125–6. Stroke: Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 126; Haines 2.85 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 8.11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.6 (= Haines 2.85–87); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Luxury and logistics at Antioch, 162?–65====

Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at [[Laodicea ad Mare|Laodicea]] and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up a mistress named Panthea,{{#tag:ref|Or &quot;Pantheia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Baldwin, review of C.P. Jones' ''Culture and Society in Lucian'', ''American Historical Review'' 92:5 (1987), 1185.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} from [[Smyrna]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyrna: Lucian, ''Imagines'' 2; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The biographer calls her a &quot;low-born girl-friend&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; but she is probably closer to Lucian's &quot;woman of perfect beauty&quot;, more beautiful than any of [[Phidias]] and [[Praxiteles]]' statues.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Imagines'' 3, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the lyre perfectly and spoke clear [[Ionic Greek]], spiced with Attic wit.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Imagines'' 11, 14–15; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Panthea read Lucian's first draft, and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her—she did not want to become the next [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Pro Imaginibus'' 7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; She had power, too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.10, cf. 7.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics declaimed Lucius' luxurious lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken to gambling, they said; he would &quot;dice the whole night through&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 4.6, tr. Magie; cf. 5.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed the company of actors.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 8.7, 8.10–11; Fronto, ''Principae Historia'' 17 (= Haines 2.217); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 6.1; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He brought a golden statue of the Greens' horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 6.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius' [[bread and circuses]] to keep them in check.&lt;ref&gt;''Principae Historiae'' 17 (= Haines 2.216–17); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Fronto called it &quot;the corn-dole and public spectacles&quot; (''annona et spectaculis''), preferring his own pompous rephrase to [[Juvenal]]'s plain ''panem et circenses''.&lt;ref&gt;''Principae Historiae'' 17 (= Haines 2.216–17); Juvenal, 10.78; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; (Fronto was, in any case, unfamiliar with Juvenal; the author was out of style through the classicizing mania of the [[Second Sophistic]], and would not become popular until the later fourth century).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, &quot;Literary Allusions in the Historia Augusta&quot;, ''Hermes'' 92:3 (1964), 367–68.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

This, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the ''vita'' dealing with Lucius' debaucheries (''HA Verus'' 4.4–6.6) is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine;{{#tag:ref|In the judgment of [[T.D. Barnes]]: 4.8, &quot;He was very fond also of charioteers, favouring the 'Greens'.&quot;; 4.10, &quot;He never needed much sleep, however; and his digestion was excellent.&quot;; perhaps 5.7,  &quot;After the banquet, moreover, they diced until dawn.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 69. Translations from the ''HA Verus'': Magie, ''ad loc''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} others take and elaborate something from the original.{{#tag:ref|In the judgment of T.D.

For he had a golden statue made of the 'Green' horse Volucer, and this he always carried around with him; indeed, he was wont to put raisins and nuts instead of barley in this horse's manger and to order him brought to him, in the [[House of Tiberius]], covered with a blanket dyed with purple, and he built him a tomb, when he died, on the Vatican Hill. It was because of this horse that gold pieces and prizes first began to be demanded for horses, and in such honour was this horse held, that frequently a whole peck of gold pieces was demanded for him by the faction of the 'Greens'.&quot;; 10.8, &quot;He was somewhat halting in speech, a reckless gambler, ever of an extravagant mode of life, and in many respects, save only that he was not cruel or given to acting, a second Nero.&quot;, for the comparison with other &quot;bad emperors&quot; at 4.6 (&quot;...he so rivalled Caligula, Nero, and Vitellius in their vices...&quot;), and, significantly, the excuse to use [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 69. Translations from the ''HA Verus'': Magie, ''ad loc''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo|Corbulo]]'s arrival one hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian army had turned soft during the east's long peace. They spent more time at the city's open-air cafés than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.1.19 (= Haines 2.149); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.&lt;ref&gt;''Principae Historia'' 13 (= Haines 2.209–11); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: &quot;not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.2 (= Haines 2.117), tr. Haines; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.2 (= Haines 2.117–19); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for Lucius' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; citing ''Panegyrici Latini'' 14(10).6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the [[Orontes River|Orontes]]. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed, the Orontes' old riverbed dried up, exposing massive bones—the bones of a [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giant]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says they were from a beast &quot;more than eleven cubits&quot; tall; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] says the it was &quot;thirty cubits&quot; tall. The oracle at [[Claros]] declared that they were the bones of the river's spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 8.29.3–4; Philostratus, ''Heroicus'' 138.6–9 K., 9.5–7 L.; Christopher Jones, &quot;The Emperor and the Giant&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' 95:4 (2000): 476–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' daughter Lucilla.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; ''Marcus'' 9.4; Barnes, 72; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163; cf. also Barnes, &quot;Legislation Against the Christians&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58:1–2 (1968), 39; &quot;Some Persons in the Historia Augusta&quot;, ''Phoenix'' 26:2 (1972), 142, citing the ''Vita Abercii'' 44ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; ''Marcus'' 9.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 7.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' 9.5–6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilla would bear three of Lucius' children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Gaius Julius Sohaemus]]. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 280 n. 42; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Sohaemus]] was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend {{aut|Rex armeniis Datus}}: Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohaemus stood before him, saluting the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 163, while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia, the Parthians intervened in [[Osroene]], a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia, just east of Syria, with its capital at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. They deposed the country's leader, Mannus, and replaced him with their own nominee, who would remain in office until 165.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, 279 n. 38; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Edessene coinage record actually begins at this point, with issues showing Vologases IV on the obverse and &quot;Wael the king&quot; ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: W'L MLK') on the reverse).&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''Near East'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evidence of Lucian, the Parthians still held the southern, Roman bank of the Euphrates (in Syria) as late as 163 (he refers to a battle at Sura, which is on the southern side of the river).&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 29; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the year, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.&lt;ref&gt;Fronto, ''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130; &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The letter noting the victories (''Ad Verum Imperator'' 2.1) dates to 164 (Fronto makes a reference to Marcus' delay in taking the ''Armeniacus''; since he took the title in 164, the letter can be no earlier than that date),&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, &quot;Chronology&quot;, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; but the battles themselves date to 163.&lt;ref&gt;Astarita, 41; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1098]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little movement in 164; most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Invasion of Mesopotamia (165) ====
[[File:The apotheosis of Lucius Verus.jpg|thumb|''The apotheosis of Lucius Verus'', 2nd century relief plates from [[Ephesus]], on display at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]]]
In 165, Roman forces, perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica, moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, Mannus re-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169.&lt;/ref&gt; His coinage resumed, too: 'Ma'nu the king' (Syriac: M'NW MLK') or Antonine dynasts on the obverse, and 'King Mannos, friend of Romans' (Greek: ''Basileus Mannos Philorōmaios'') on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''Near East'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris; their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 15, 19; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 20, 28; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163, citing Syme, ''Roman Papers'', 5.689ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: [[Seleucia]] on the right bank of the Tigris and [[Ctesiphon]] on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid empire]], one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Diadochi|successor kingdoms]]), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 8.3–4; Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, ''Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), 124ff., on the date.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia's long decline.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Matthews, ''The Roman Empire of Ammianus'' (London: Duckworth, 1989), 142–43. Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 163–64, says that the siege marked the end of the city's history.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Iunius Maximus, a young ''tribunus laticlavius'' serving in III Gallica under Cassius, took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty (''dona'') for bringing the good news, and immediate promotion to the quaestorship.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing Alföldy and Halfmann, &quot;Iunius Mauricus und die Victoria Parthica&quot;, ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 35 (1979): 195–212 = Alföldy, ''Römische Heeresgeschichte. Beiträge 1962–1985'' (Amsterdam, 1987), 203 ff (with addenda, 220–1); Fronto, ''Ad amicos'' 1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as ''imperatores'' again, earning the title 'imp. III'.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 384 ff., 1248 ff., 1271 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title 'Medicus',&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing P. Kneissl, ''Die Siegestitulatur der römischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts'' (Göttingen, 1969), 99 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperors were again hailed as ''imperatores'', becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals. The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M. Claudius Fronto, an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus. He was probably the first senator in his family.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C 874.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto was consul for 165, probably in honor of the capture of Edessa.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing Alföldy, ''Konsulat'', 179 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; P. Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front, and also served under Priscus. Martius Verus was a westerner, whose ''patria'' was perhaps [[Toulouse|Tolosa]] in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent general, however, was [[Avidius Cassius|C. Avidius Cassius]], commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus]]. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ''ab epistulis'', followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 130, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, ''passim''; Syme, ''Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia'' 1984 (= ''Roman Papers'' IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?).&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius and Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, &quot;Hadrian to the Antonines&quot;, 164, citing Alföldy, ''Konsulat'', 24, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vologases IV of Parthia]] (147–191) made peace but was forced to cede western [[Mesopotamia]] to the Romans. Lucius is reported to have been an excellent commander, without fear of delegating military tasks to more competent generals.

On his return to Rome, Lucius was awarded with a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. The parade was unusual because it included Lucius, Marcus Aurelius, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, [[Commodus]] five years old and Annius Verus of three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion.

===Years in Rome===
[[Image:Lucius Verus.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait head of Lucius Verus, found in Athens ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]). He used to sprinkle gold-dust on his blond hair to make it brighter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1KTVnjWiEo0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Antonines:+The+Roman+Empire+in+Transition&amp;sig=2TEUrhub3pzEwFeEKDQPItxqmEo#PPA27,M1 Michael Grant. ''The Antonines'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The next two years (166–168) were spent in Rome. Verus continued with his glamorous lifestyle and kept the troupe of actors and favourites with him. He had a tavern built in his house, where he celebrated parties with his friends until dawn. He also enjoyed roaming around the city among the population, without acknowledging his identity. The games of the circus were another passion in his life, especially [[chariot racing]]. Marcus Aurelius disapproved of his conduct but, since Verus continued to perform his official tasks with efficiency, there was little he could do.

===Wars on the Danube and death===
{{Further|Marcomannic Wars}}

In the spring of 168 war broke out in the [[Danube|Danubian]] border when the [[Marcomanni]] invaded the Roman territory. This war would last until 180, but Verus did not see the end of it. In 168, as Verus and Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome from the field, Verus fell ill with symptoms attributed to [[foodborne illness|food poisoning]], dying after a few days (169). However, scholars believe that Verus may have been a victim of [[smallpox]], as he died during a widespread epidemic known as the [[Antonine Plague]].

Despite the minor differences between them, Marcus Aurelius grieved the loss of his adoptive brother. He accompanied the body to Rome, where he offered games to honour his memory. After the funeral, the senate declared Verus divine to be worshipped as ''Divus Verus''.

'''Commodus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ə|d|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Commodus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS COMMODVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 31 August 161 AD&amp;nbsp;– 31 December 192 AD), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 180 to 192. He also ruled as co-emperor with his father [[Marcus Aurelius]] from 177 until his father's death in 180.

His accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since [[Titus]] succeeded [[Vespasian]] in 79. He was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather (who had adopted his father) as the two preceding emperors. Commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor &quot;[[born in the purple]]&quot;, i.e., during his [[Marcus Aurelius|father's]] reign.

Commodus was assassinated in 192.

==Early life and rise to power (161–180)==

===Early life===
Commodus was born on 31 August 161, as Commodus, in [[Lanuvium]], near [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HA LOC 1&quot;&gt;''Historia Augusta - Life of Commodus'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the reigning emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and Aurelius' first cousin, [[Faustina the Younger]]; the youngest daughter of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]]. Commodus had an elder twin brother, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, who died in 165. On 12 October 166, Commodus was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] together with his younger brother, [[Marcus Annius Verus Caesar|Marcus Annius Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 12.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;David 1&quot;&gt;David L. Vagi ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' Vol. One: History p.248&lt;/ref&gt; The latter died in 169 having failed to recover from an operation, which left Commodus as Marcus Aurelius' sole surviving son.&lt;ref name=&quot;David 1&quot;/&gt;

He was looked after by his father's physician, [[Galen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SPM&quot;&gt;Susan P. Mattern ''The Prince of Medicine: Galen in the Roman Empire'' p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 71.33.1&lt;/ref&gt; in order to keep Commodus healthy and alive. Galen treated many of Commodus' common illnesses. Commodus received extensive tutoring by a multitude of teachers with a focus on intellectual education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 197&quot;&gt;Anthony R Birley ''Marcus Aurelius: A Biography'' p.197&lt;/ref&gt; Among his teachers Onesicrates, Antistius Capella, Titus Aius Sanctus, and Pitholaus are mentioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 197&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodus is known to have been at [[Carnuntum]], the headquarters of Marcus Aurelius during the [[Marcomannic Wars]], in 172. It was presumably there that, on 15 October 172, he was given the victory title ''Germanicus'', in the presence of the [[Roman army|army]]. The title suggests that Commodus was present at his father's victory over the [[Marcomanni]]. On 20 January 175, Commodus entered the [[College of Pontiffs]], the starting point of a career in public life.

In April 175, [[Avidius Cassius]], Governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], declared himself Emperor following rumours that Marcus Aurelius had died. Having been accepted as Emperor by Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], Cassius carried on his rebellion even after it had become obvious that Marcus was still alive. During the preparations for the campaign against Cassius, the Prince assumed his [[toga virilis]] on the [[Danube|Danubian]] front on 7 July 175, thus formally entering [[adulthood]]. Cassius, however, was killed by one of his [[centurion]]s before the campaign against him could begin.

Commodus subsequently accompanied his father on a lengthy trip to the Eastern provinces, during which he visited [[Antioch]]. The Emperor and his son then traveled to [[Athens]], where they were initiated into the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. They then returned to Rome in the [[Autumn]] of 176.

===Joint rule with father (177)===
Marcus Aurelius was the first emperor since [[Vespasian]] to have a biological son of his own and, though he himself was the fifth in the line of the so-called [[Five Good Emperors]], each of whom had adopted his successor, it seems to have been his firm intention that Commodus should be his heir. On 27 November 176, Marcus Aurelius granted Commodus the rank of ''[[Imperator]]''  and, in the middle of 177, the title ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', giving his son the same status as his own and formally sharing power.

On 23 December of the same year, the two Augusti celebrated a joint [[Roman triumph|triumph]], and Commodus was given [[tribune|tribunician]] power. On 1 January 177, Commodus became [[consul]] for the first time, which made him, aged 15, the youngest consul in Roman history up to that time. He subsequently married [[Bruttia Crispina]] before accompanying his father to the Danubian front once more in 178, where Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, leaving the 18-year-old Commodus sole emperor.

==Sole reign (180–192)==
Upon his ascension, Commodus devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He reduced the weight of the [[denarius]] from 96 per [[Roman pound]] to 105 (3.85&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.35&amp;nbsp;grams). He also reduced the silver purity from 79&amp;nbsp;percent to 76&amp;nbsp;percent&amp;nbsp;– the silver weight dropping from 2.57&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.34&amp;nbsp;grams. In 186 he further reduced the purity and silver weight to 74&amp;nbsp;percent and 2.22&amp;nbsp;grams respectively, being 108 to the Roman pound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; His reduction of the denarius during his rule was the largest since the empire's first devaluation during [[Nero]]'s reign.

Whereas the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] had been marked by almost continuous warfare, that of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of [[Dio Cassius]], a contemporary observer of the period, his accession marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a famous comment which has led some historians, notably [[Edward Gibbon]], to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

Despite his notoriety, and considering the importance of his reign, Commodus' years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are Dio Cassius (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer, but for this reign, only transmitted in fragments and abbreviations), [[Herodian]] and the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' (untrustworthy for its character as a work of literature rather than history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it may well be embroidering upon what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).

[[File:Commodus denier verso ag1.jpg|thumb|250px||A [[Denarius]] featuring Commodus]]
Commodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180. Unlike the preceding Emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and Marcus Aurelius, he seems to have had little interest in the business of administration and tended throughout his reign to leave the practical running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning with [[Saoterus]], a freedman from [[Nicomedia]] who had become his [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner. Nevertheless, though the [[Roman Senate|senatorial order]] came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign, not least because of his lavish shows of largesse (recorded on his coinage) and because he staged and took part in spectacular [[gladiator]]ial combats.

One of the ways he paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'') is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').

===The conspiracies of 182===
[[File:Bust of Commodus 180-192 AD.JPG|thumb|250px|A bust of Commodus as a youth ([[Roman-Germanic Museum]], Cologne).]]
At the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 18, inherited many of his father's senior advisers, notably [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus]] (the second husband of Commodus' sister [[Lucilla]]), his father-in-law [[Gaius Bruttius Praesens]], Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio, and [[Caius Aufidius Victorinus|Aufidius Victorinus]], who was [[Praefectus urbi|Prefect of the City of Rome]]. He also had five surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Four of his sisters were considerably older than he; the eldest, Lucilla, held the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]] as the widow of her first husband, [[Lucius Verus]].

The first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the [[Roman Empress|Empress]] Crispina. Her husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men alleged to have been her lovers, [[Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus]] (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and [[Appius Claudius Quintianus]], attempted to murder Commodus as he entered a theater. They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor's bodyguard.

Quadratus and Quintianus were executed. Lucilla was exiled to [[Capri]] and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two [[praetorian prefect]]s, [[Tarrutenius Paternus]], had actually been involved in the conspiracy but his involvement was not discovered until later on, and in the aftermath, he and his colleague, [[Tigidius Perennis|Sextus Tigidius Perennis]], were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.

Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy, one apparently led by [[Publius Salvius Julianus]], who was the son of the jurist [[Salvius Julianus]] and was betrothed to Paternus' daughter. Salvius and Paternus were executed along with a number of other prominent consulars and senators. [[Didius Julianus]], the future emperor and a relative of Salvius Julianus, was dismissed from the governorship of [[Germania Inferior]].

====Cleander====
Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander|Cleander]], a [[Phrygia]]n [[freedman]] who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus. After those attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. Being physically strong, his chief interest was in sport: taking part in [[horse racing]], [[chariot racing]], and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.

===Dacia and Britain===
[[File:Commodus, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna - 20100226.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of Commodus ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna). According to [[Herodian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d7DhHGX6wZkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Commodus+appearance&amp;sig=oHNII-3un-Rs1QhDGBwxsHxh-R0 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt; he was well proportioned and attractive, with naturally blonde and curly hair.]]
Commodus was inaugurated in 183 as consul with Aufidius Victorinus for a colleague and assumed the title ''Pius''. War broke out in [[Dacia]]: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne, [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], both distinguished themselves in the campaign. Also, in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 184, the governor [[Ulpius Marcellus]] re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the [[Antonine Wall]], but the [[legionaries]] revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate, Priscus, as emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscus refused to accept their acclamations, but Perennis had all the legionary [[legatus|legates]] in Britain [[Cashiering|cashiered]]. On 15 October 184 at the [[Capitoline Games]], a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus, who was watching, but was immediately put to death. According to Dio Cassius, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

However, the following year, a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] to suppress brigands) also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor (they had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival), and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions: Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as [[Governors of Roman Britain|governor of Britain]] by [[Pertinax]]; brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.

===Cleander's zenith and fall (185–190)===
Cleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by becoming responsible for all public offices: he sold and bestowed entry to the Senate, army commands, [[Roman governor|governorships]] and, increasingly, even the [[suffect consul]]ships to the highest bidder. Unrest around the empire increased, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in [[Gaul]] and [[Germania|Germany]]. Pescennius Niger mopped up the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign, and a revolt in [[Brittany]] was put down by two [[Roman legion|legions]] brought over from Britain.

In 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, Maternus, came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March, but he was betrayed and executed. In the same year, [[Pertinax]] unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander&amp;nbsp;– Antistius Burrus (one of Commodus' brothers-in-law) and Arrius Antoninus. As a result, Commodus appeared even more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates.

Early in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, [[Publius Atilius Aebutianus|Atilius Aebutianus]], and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of ''a pugione'' (&quot;dagger-bearer&quot;) with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls&amp;nbsp;– a record in the 1000-year history of the Roman consulship—all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]).

In the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the ''praefectus annonae'' [[Papirius Dionysius]], the official actually in charge of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply]], contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the [[Circus Maximus]]: he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the ''[[Vigiles Urbani]]'' to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at [[Laurentum]] in the house of the [[Sextus Quinctilius Condianus|Quinctilii]], for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.

At the urging of his mistress [[Marcia (mistress of Commodus)|Marcia]], Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus' cousin [[Annia Fundania Faustina]], and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed too.

The emperor now changed his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At 29, he took over more of the reins of power, though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]], who about this time also had many Christians freed from working in the mines in [[Sardinia]]. Marcia, the widow of Quadratus, who had been executed in 182, is alleged to have been a Christian.

===Megalomania (190–192)===
In opposition to the Senate, in his pronouncements and [[iconography]], Commodus had always laid stress on his unique status as a source of god-like power, liberality and physical prowess. Innumerable statues around the empire were set up portraying him in the guise of [[Hercules]], reinforcing the image of him as a demigod, a physical giant, a protector and a battler against beasts and men (see &quot;Commodus and Hercules&quot; and &quot;Commodus the Gladiator&quot; below). Moreover, as Hercules, he could claim to be the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the representative of the supreme god of the Roman [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. These tendencies now increased to [[megalomania]]cal proportions. Far from celebrating his descent from Marcus Aurelius, the actual source of his power, he stressed his own personal uniqueness as the bringer of a new order, seeking to re-cast the empire in his own image.

During 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the [[Pax (mythology)|Temple of Pax]], the [[Temple of Vesta]] and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.

Perhaps seeing this as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new [[Romulus]], ritually re-founded Rome, renaming the city ''Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana''. All the months of the year were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: ''Lucius'', ''Aelius'', ''Aurelius'', ''Commodus'', ''Augustus'', ''Herculeus'', ''Romanus'', ''Exsuperatorius'', ''Amazonius'', ''Invictus'', ''Felix'', ''Pius''. The legions were renamed ''Commodianae'', the fleet which imported grain from [[Africa province|Africa]] was termed ''Alexandria Commodiana Togata'', the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman people themselves were all given the name ''Commodianus'', and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called ''Dies Commodianus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/commod.htm Commodus (AD 180–192)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire and Roman life and religion. He also had the head of the [[Colossus of Nero]] adjacent to the [[Colosseum]] replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club and placed a [[bronze]] [[lion]] at its feet to make it look like Hercules, and added an inscription boasting of being &quot;the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.22.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination (192)===
[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 008.jpg|thumb|[[Damnatio memoriae]] of Commodus on an inscription in the Museum of Roman History [[Osterburken]]. The abbreviation &quot;CO&quot; has been restored with paint.]]
In November 192, Commodus held Plebeian Games, in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, winning all the bouts. Also in December he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.

At this point, the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax, taking Marcia into their confidence. On 31 December Marcia poisoned his food but he vomited up the poison; so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] to strangle him in his bath. Upon his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy (a ''de facto'' ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'') and restored the original name to the city of Rome and its institutions. Commodus' statues were thrown down. His body was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]]. In 195 the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], trying to gain favour with the family of Marcus Aurelius, rehabilitated Commodus' memory and had the Senate deify him.&lt;ref&gt;To “accept kinship with Commodus&amp;nbsp;... the bluntly pragmatic decision was taken to deify the former emperor, thus legitimizing Severus’ seizure of power.”  See Annelise Freisenbruch, ''Caesars' Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire'' (London and New York: Free Press, 2010), 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodus was succeeded by [[Pertinax]], whose reign was short lived, being the first to fall victim to the [[Year of the Five Emperors]]. Commodus' death marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]].

==Character and physical prowess==

===Character and motivations===
[[File:Commode pièce.jpg|thumb|Commodus]]
&lt;!-- Replaced by KunsthistorischesMuseumComodus.jpg above [[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna June 2006 024.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bust of Commodus ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna) According to [[Herodian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d7DhHGX6wZkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Commodus+appearance&amp;sig=oHNII-3un-Rs1QhDGBwxsHxh-R0 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt; he was well proportioned and attractive, with naturally blonde and curly hair.]]  --&gt;
Dio Cassius, a first-hand witness, describes him as &quot;not naturally wicked but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.1.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

His recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father’s policies, his father’s advisers, and especially his father’s austere lifestyle, and an alienation from the surviving members of his family. It seems likely that he was brought up in an atmosphere of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[asceticism]], which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule.
After repeated attempts on Commodus' life, [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]] were often killed for making him angry. One such notable event was the attempted extermination of the house of the Quinctilii. Condianus and Maximus were executed on the pretext that, while they were not implicated in any plots, their wealth and talent would make them unhappy with the current state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.5.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes of name===
On his accession as sole ruler, Commodus added the name Antoninus to his official nomenclature. In October 180 he changed his ''[[praenomen]]'' from Lucius to Marcus, presumably in honour of his father.  He later took the title of ''Felix'' in 185. In 191 he restored his ''praenomen'' to Lucius and added the family name Aelius, apparently linking himself to Hadrian and Hadrian's adopted son [[Lucius Aelius Caesar]], whose original name was also Commodus.

Later that year he dropped Antoninus and adopted as his full style Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Augustus Herculeus Romanus Exsuperatorius Amazonius Invictus Felix Pius (the order of some of these titles varies in the sources). &quot;Exsuperatorius&quot; (the supreme) was a title given to Jupiter, and &quot;Amazonius&quot; identified him again with Hercules.

An inscribed altar from [[Dura-Europos]] on the Euphrates shows that Commodus' titles and the renaming of the months were disseminated to the furthest reaches of the Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that Commodus claimed two additional titles: ''Pacator Orbis'' (pacifier of the world) and ''Dominus Noster'' (Our Lord). The latter eventually would be used as a conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to assume it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiedel |first=M. P |year=1993 |title=Commodus the God-Emperor and the Army |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=83 |issue= |pages=109–114 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/300981|jstor=300981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodus and Hercules===
Disdaining the more philosophic inclinations of his father, Commodus was extremely proud of his physical prowess. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, described Commodus as an extremely handsome man.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael. The Roman Emperors (1985)pp 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above, he ordered many statues to be made showing him dressed as Hercules with a lion's hide and a club. He thought of himself as the reincarnation of Hercules, frequently emulating the legendary hero's feats by appearing in the arena to fight a variety of wild animals. He was left-handed, and very proud of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXIII pp 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio and the writers of the ''[[Augustan History]]'' say that Commodus was a skilled archer, who could shoot the heads off [[ostriches]] in full gallop, and kill a [[Black panther|panther]] as it attacked a victim in the arena.

===Commodus the gladiator===
Commodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the [[arena]] himself, dressed as a gladiator. The Romans found Commodus' naked gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian's Roman History F.L. Muller Edition 1.15.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumoured that he was actually the son, not of Marcus Aurelius, but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of [[Caieta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Life of Marcus Aurelius, XIX. The film ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' makes use of this story: one of the characters is an old gladiator who eventually reveals himself to be Commodus' real father.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arena, Commodus always won since his opponents always submitted to the emperor. Thus, these public fights would not end in death. Privately, it was his custom to slay his practice opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.3&lt;/ref&gt; For each appearance in the arena, he charged the city of Rome a million [[sestertius|sesterces]], straining the Roman economy.

Commodus raised the ire of many military officials in Rome for his Hercules persona in the arena. Often, wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword. Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.20.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;  These acts may have contributed to his assassination.

Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror of the Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon pg 106 &quot;disgorged at once a hundred lions; a hundred darts&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Volume I'' Everyman's Library (Knopf) New York. 1910. pg 106 &quot;with arrows whose point was shaped in the form of a crescent&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next.&lt;ref name=foxcomm&gt;Lane Fox, Robin ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian'' Basic Books.  2006 pg 446 &quot;brandishing a sword in one hand and bloodied neck...He gesticulated at the Senate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] leaves to conceal their laughter.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On another occasion, Commodus killed three [[elephant]]s on the floor of the arena by himself.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, H. H ''The Elephant in the Greek and Roman World'' Thames and Hudson. 1974 pg 252&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Commodus killed a [[giraffe]], which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon pg 107 &quot;*1 Commodus killed a camelopardalis or giraffe&amp;nbsp;... the most useless of the quadrupeds&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
* In 1964's ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (movie)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', a fictionalized Commodus who serves as the main antagonist of the film is portrayed by [[Christopher Plummer]].
* In 2000's [[Academy Award]]–winner for Best Picture, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', a fictionalized Commodus serves as the main antagonist of the film.

'''Pertinax''' ({{lang-la|Publius Helvius Pertinax Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Pertinax's name would be inscribed as IMP(erator) CAES(ar) P(ublius) HELV(ius) PERTINAX AVG(ustus).&lt;/ref&gt; 1 August 126 – 28 March 193) was [[Roman Emperor]] for the first three months of 193.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''History of the Roman Empire from the time of Vespasian to the Extinction of the Western Empire'' (1853), pg. 158. Although Commodus was killed on 31 December 192, Pertinax was not acclaimed emperor until 1 January 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Successor to the assassinated [[Commodus]], he was the first to serve as emperor during the tumultuous [[Year of the Five Emperors]]. 

Born the son of a [[freedman|freed slave]], Pertinax originally worked as a teacher before becoming an officer in the Roman legion.  He fought in the [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–166|war with the Parthians]] during the 160s, and success there led to higher-ranking positions in both the military and political spheres, including [[Roman governor|provincial governor]] and [[Praefectus urbi|urban prefect]]. He was also a member of the [[Roman Senate]], where he was a contemporary of the historian [[Cassius Dio]]. 

Following the death of Commodus, Pertinax was acclaimed emperor. He attempted to institute several reform measures, although the short length of his time as emperor prevented the success of those attempts. One of those reforms, the restoration of discipline among the [[Praetorian Guards]], led to conflict that eventually culminated in Pertinax's murder by the Guard. After his death, the Praetorians auctioned off the imperial title, which was won by the wealthy senator [[Didius Julianus]], whose reign would last sixty-six days.

Pertinax would be deified by the successor of Julianus, [[Septimius Severus]]. His historical reputation has largely been a positive one, following the assessment of Dio.

==Early life==
His career before becoming emperor is documented in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' and confirmed in many places by existing inscriptions. Born in [[Alba, Italy|Alba Pompeia]] in Italy,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:3&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:3&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[freedman]] Helvius Successus,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; originally Pertinax made his way as a ''[[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammaticus]]'' (teacher of [[grammar]]),{{sfnp|Canduci|2010|page=50}} but he eventually decided to find a more rewarding line of work and through the help of patronage he was commissioned an officer in a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–166|Parthian war]] that followed,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 2:1&lt;/ref&gt;  he was able to distinguish himself, which resulted in a string of promotions, and after postings in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] (as military tribune of the [[Legio VI Victrix|Legio VI ''Victrix'']]){{sfnp|Birley|2005|page=173}} and along the [[Danube]], he served as a procurator in [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 2:4&lt;/ref&gt;  He suffered a setback as a victim of court intrigues during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], but shortly afterwards he was recalled to assist [[Claudius Pompeianus]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:3&quot;/&gt; In 175 he received the honor of a [[Roman consul|suffect consulship]]{{sfnp|Meckler|1997}} and until 185, Pertinax was governor of the provinces of Upper and Lower [[Moesia]], [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], Syria and finally [[List of Roman governors of Britain|governor of Britain]].{{sfnp|Birley|2005|page=173}}

In the decade of the 180s, Pertinax took a pivotal role in the [[Roman Senate]] until the praetorian prefect [[Sextus Tigidius Perennis]] forced him out of public life.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recalled after three years to Britain, where the Roman army was in a state of mutiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:4&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:4&lt;/ref&gt;  He tried to quell the unruly soldiers there but one legion mutinied and attacked his bodyguard, leaving Pertinax for dead.{{sfnp|Birley|2005|page=174}} When he recovered, he punished the mutineers severely, which led to his growing reputation as a disciplinarian.{{sfnp|Canduci|2010|page=50}}  When he was forced to resign in 187, the reason given was that the legions had grown hostile to him because of his harsh rule.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 3:10&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as proconsul of Africa during the years 188–189,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 4:1&lt;/ref&gt; and followed this term of service with the urban prefecture of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 18:2&lt;/ref&gt; and a second consulship as ordinarius with the emperor as his colleague.{{sfnp|Birley|2005|page=174}}

==Emperor==
[[File:Pertinax Providentia Aureus.jpg|thumb|Roman [[aureus]] struck under the rule of Pertinax]]

When [[Commodus]]' behaviour became increasingly erratic throughout the early 190s, Pertinax is thought to have been implicated in the conspiracy that led to his assassination on 31 December 192.{{sfnp|Canduci|2010|page=50}}  The plot was carried out by the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]], [[Commodus]]' mistress [[Marcia (mistress of Commodus)|Marcia]], and his chamberlain Eclectus.{{sfnp|Bowman|2005|page=1}}  After the murder had been carried out, Pertinax, who was serving as [[urban prefect]] at this time, was hurried to the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian Camp]] and proclaimed emperor the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 4:5&lt;/ref&gt;  His short reign (86 days) was an uneasy one. He attempted to emulate the restrained practices of [[Marcus Aurelius]], and made an effort to reform the [[alimenta]] but he faced antagonism from many quarters.{{sfnp|Gibbon|1788|ps=, chapter 4.}} 

Ancient writers detail how the [[Praetorian Guard]] expected a generous [[donativum]] on his ascension, and when they were disappointed, agitated until he produced the money, selling off [[Commodus]]' property,{{sfnp|Bowman|2005|page=2}} including the concubines and youths Commodus kept for his sexual pleasures.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:5&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 7:8&lt;/ref&gt; He reformed the [[Roman currency]] dramatically, increasing the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 74% to 87% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.22&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.75&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |publisher=Tulane University |title=Roman Currency of the Principate |author=Kenneth W.

Pertinax attempted to impose stricter military discipline upon the pampered Praetorians.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1:8&lt;/ref&gt;  In early March he narrowly averted one conspiracy by a group to replace him with the consul [[Quintus Pompeius Sosius Falco|Quintus Sosius Falco]] while he was in [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] inspecting the arrangements for grain shipments.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:8&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:8&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was betrayed; Falco himself was pardoned but several of the officers behind the coup were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 10:4&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 193, Pertinax was at his palace when, according to the ''Historia Augusta'', a contingent of some three hundred soldiers of the Praetorian Guard rushed the gates&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 11:1&lt;/ref&gt; (two hundred according to Cassius Dio).&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:9&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:9&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient sources suggest that they had received only half their promised pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:8&quot;/&gt;  Neither the guards on duty nor the palace officials chose to resist them. Pertinax sent Laetus to meet them, but he chose to side with the insurgents instead and deserted the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 11:7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although advised to flee, he then attempted to reason with them, and was almost successful before being struck down by one of the soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 74:10&quot;&gt;Dio, 74:10&lt;/ref&gt;  Pertinax must have been aware of the danger he faced by assuming the purple, for he refused to use imperial titles for either his wife or son,{{sfnp|Bowman|2005|page=1}} thus protecting them from the aftermath of his own assassination. He did however appoint his father-in-law [[Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus]] as ''[[Praefectus urbi]]'' of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

==Aftermath==
{{Year of Five Emperors}}
The praetorian guards auctioned off the imperial position, which Senator [[Didius Julianus]] won and became the new Emperor,{{sfnp|Canduci|2010|page=50}} an act which triggered a brief civil war over the succession, won later in the same year by [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio, 74:17:4&lt;/ref&gt;

After his entry to Rome, Septimius recognized Pertinax as a legitimate emperor, executed the soldiers who killed him, and not only pressured the Senate to deify him and provide for him a [[state funeral]],&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 15:1&lt;/ref&gt;  but also adopted his ''[[cognomen]]'' of Pertinax as part of his name,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 15:2&lt;/ref&gt; and for some time held games on the anniversary of Pertinax's ascension and his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Pertinax'', 15:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Pertinax is discussed in ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli – ''The Prince'', Ch. XIX&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the importance of a prince not being hated, Machiavelli provides Pertinax as an example of how it is just as easy for a ruler to be hated for good actions as for bad ones. Though describing him as a good man,&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli – ''The Prince'', Ch. XIX. Pertinax is described, along with [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Severus Alexander]], as &quot;men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli considered Pertinax's attempt to reform a soldiery that had become &quot;accustomed to live licentiously&quot; a mistake, as it inspired their hatred of him, which led to his overthrow and death. 

Pertinax is described by [[David Hume]] in his essay ''Of the Original Contract'' as an &quot;excellent prince&quot; possessing an implied modesty when, on the arrival of soldiers who had come to proclaim him emperor, believed that Commodus had ordered his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hume – ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'', II.XII.41&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate over ratification of the [[United States Constitution]], Virginia politician [[John Dawson (U.S. politician)|John Dawson]], at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|state's ratifying convention]] in 1788, spoke of the &quot;atrocious murder&quot; of Pertinax by the Praetorian Guard as an example of the danger of establishing a [[standing army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=John Remington |date=2009 |title=Free, Sovereign, and Independent States: The Intended Meaning of the American Constitution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fOeMT99m44C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22John+Dawson%22+Pertinax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI0Kr5ye66xwIVAmY-Ch1fhAur#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Dawson%22%20Pertinax&amp;f=false |location=United States |publisher=Pelican Publishing |page=139 |isbn=9781589805897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richard |first=Carl J. |date=1994 |title=The Founders and the Classics: Greece, Rome, and the American Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSEIrw6QryoC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22John+Dawson%22+Pertinax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIx4bOjeu6xwIVgTg-Ch154QtU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Dawson%22%20Pertinax&amp;f=false |location=United States |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=103 |isbn=0-674-31426-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pertinax was the [[pseudonym]] of the French journalist {{Ill|fr|André Géraud}} (1882–1974).

In ''[[Romanitas (novel)|''Romanitas'']]'', a fictional [[alternate history fiction|alternate history]] novel by [[Sophia McDougall]], Pertinax's reign is the [[point of divergence]]. In the history as established by the novel, the plot against Pertinax was thwarted, and Pertinax introduced a series of reforms that would consolidate the Roman Empire to such a degree that it would still be a major power in the 21st century.

{{Year of Five Emperors}}

'''Didius Julianus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Didius Severus Iulianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Julianus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS DIDIVS IVLIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 30 January 133 or 2 February 137 – 1 June 193) was [[Roman Emperor]] for nine weeks during the year 193.

Julianus ascended the throne after buying it from the [[Praetorian Guard]], who had assassinated his predecessor [[Pertinax]]. This led to the [[Year of the Five Emperors|Roman Civil War of 193–197]]. Julianus was ousted and sentenced to death by his successor, [[Septimius Severus]].

==Early life==
Julianus was born to [[Quintus Petronius Didius Severus]] and [[Aemilia Clara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ha12&quot;&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus's father came from a prominent family in [[Mediolanum]] (Milan) and his mother was a North African woman of Roman descent, from a family of consular rank. His brothers were Didius Proculus and Didius Nummius Albinus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha12&quot;/&gt; His date of birth is given as 30 January 133 by [[Cassius Dio]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.5&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.5&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 February 137 by the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 9.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Didius Julianus was raised by [[Domitia Lucilla]], mother of Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.3&lt;/ref&gt; With Domitia's help, he was appointed at a very early age to the [[Vigintisexviri|vigintivirate]], the first step towards public distinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha14&quot;&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; He married a Roman woman named [[Manlia Scantilla]], and sometime around 153, Scantilla bore him a daughter and only child [[Didia Clara]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
In succession Julianus held the offices of [[Quaestor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ha14&quot;/&gt; and [[Aedile]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ha15&quot;&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.5&lt;/ref&gt; and then, around 162, was named as [[Praetor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ha15&quot;/&gt; He was nominated to the command of the [[Legio XXII Primigenia]] in [[Mogontiacum]] (now [[Mainz]]).&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.6&lt;/ref&gt; In 170, he became [[list of Roman governors of Gallia Belgica|praefectus]] of [[Gallia Belgica]] and served for five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha17&quot;&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.7&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for his skill and gallantry in repressing an insurrection among the [[Chauci]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ha17&quot;/&gt; a tribe dwelling on the [[Elbe]], he was raised to the consulship in 175, along with [[Pertinax]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.8, 2.3; ''Pertinax'', 14.5&lt;/ref&gt;

He further distinguished himself in a campaign against the [[Chatti]],&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.8&lt;/ref&gt; ruled [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 1.9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Germania Inferior]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ha21&quot;&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 2.1&lt;/ref&gt; and then was made prefect charged with distributing money to the poor of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ha21&quot;/&gt; It was around this time that he was charged with having conspired against the life of [[Commodus]], but he had the good fortune to be acquitted and to witness the punishment of his accuser.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha21&quot;/&gt; He governed [[Bithynia]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded Pertinax as the [[proconsul]] of [[Africa Province|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 2.3; ''Pertinax'', 4.1, 14.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor (193)==
After the murder of Pertinax (28 March 193), the Praetorian assassins announced that the throne was to be sold to the man who would pay the highest price.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ii.6.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus]], [[Praefectus urbi|prefect of the city]], father-in-law of the murdered emperor, being at that moment in the camp to which he had been sent to calm the troops, began making offers,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.1; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 2.4, 2.6&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Julianus, having been roused from a banquet by his wife and daughter,&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ii.6.7&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in all haste, and being unable to gain admission, stood before the gate, and with a loud voice competed for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.3; Herodian, ii.6.8&lt;/ref&gt;

As the bidding went on, the soldiers reported to each of the two competitors, the one within the fortifications, the other outside the rampart, the sum offered by his rival. Eventually Sulpicianus promised 20,000 [[sesterces]] to every soldier; Julianus, fearing that Sulpicianus would gain the throne, then offered 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.5&lt;/ref&gt; The guards immediately closed with the offer of Julianus, threw open the gates, saluted him by the name of Caesar, and proclaimed him emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.5; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 2.7; Herodian, ii.6.11&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened by the military, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] declared him emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 12; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 3.3&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and his daughter both received the title Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 3.4, 4.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
Upon his accession, Julianus immediately devalued the [[Roman currency]], decreasing the silver purity of the denarius from 87% to 81.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.75&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.40&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial confusion had subsided, the population did not tamely submit to the dishonour brought upon Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 13.2–5; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 4.2–7; Herodian, ii.7.3&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever Julianus appeared in public he was saluted with groans, imprecations, and shouts of &quot;robber and parricide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 13.3&lt;/ref&gt; The mob tried to obstruct his progress to the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], and even threw stones.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 4.2, 4.4&lt;/ref&gt;

When news of the public anger in Rome spread across the Empire, the generals [[Pescennius Niger]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Septimius Severus]] in [[Pannonia]], and [[Clodius Albinus]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], each having three [[Roman legion|legions]] under his command, refused to recognize the authority of Julianus.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 14.3–4; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 5.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus declared Severus a public enemy because he was the nearest of the three and, therefore, the most dangerous foe.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 5.3; ''Septimius Severus'', 5.5&lt;/ref&gt; Deputies were sent from the Senate to persuade the soldiers to abandon him;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Septimius Severus'', 5.5&lt;/ref&gt; a new general was nominated to supersede him, and a [[centurion]] dispatched to take his life.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 5.4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Praetorian Guard]], long strangers to active military operations, were marched into the [[Campus Martius]], regularly drilled, and trained in the construction of fortifications and field works.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.1–2; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 5.9; Herodian, ii.11.9&lt;/ref&gt; Severus, however, having secured the support of Albinus by declaring him [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 15.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; progressed towards the city and made himself master of the fleet at [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.5; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 6.3&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated [[Tullius Crispinus]], the [[Praetorian prefect]], who had been sent to halt his progress,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 6.4&lt;/ref&gt; and gained over to his cause the ambassadors sent to turn his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.1; Historia Augusta, ''Septimius Severus'', 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Praetorian Guard, lacking discipline and sunk in debauchery and sloth, were incapable of offering any effectual resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.3&lt;/ref&gt; Matters being desperate, Julianus now attempted negotiation and offered to share the empire with his rival.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.2; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 6.9, ''Septimius Severus'', 5.7; Herodian, ii.12.3&lt;/ref&gt; Severus ignored these overtures and pressed forward, all Italy declaring for him as he advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ii.11.6&lt;/ref&gt; At last the Praetorians, having received assurances that they would suffer no punishment – provided they surrendered the actual murderers of Pertinax –  seized the ringleaders of the conspiracy and reported what they had done to [[Silius Messala]], the consul, by whom the Senate was summoned and informed of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate passed a motion proclaiming Severus emperor, awarded divine honours to Pertinax, and sentenced Julianus to death.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.4; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 8.7; Herodian, ii.12.6&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus was deserted by all except one of the prefects and his son-in-law, [[Sextus Cornelius Repentinus|Repentinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 8.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution (193) ===
Julianus was killed in the palace by a soldier in the third month of his reign (1 June 193).&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.5; Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 8.8&lt;/ref&gt; Severus dismissed the Praetorian Guard and executed the soldiers who had killed Pertinax.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxv, 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cassius Dio]], who lived in Rome during the period, Julianus's last words were &quot;But what evil have I done? Whom have I killed?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.5&quot;/&gt; His body was given to his wife and daughter, who buried it in his great-grandfather's tomb by the fifth milestone on the [[Via Labicana]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Didius Julianus'', 8.10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Septimius Severus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɪər|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Lucius Septimius Severus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Severus' name would be inscribed as LVCIVS SEPTIMIVS SEVERVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 11 April 145 – 4 February 211), also known as '''Severus''', was [[Roman emperor]] from 193 to 211. Severus was born in [[Leptis Magna]] in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. As a young man he advanced through the ''[[cursus honorum]]''—the customary succession of offices—under the reigns of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Commodus]]. Severus seized power after the death of Emperor [[Pertinax]] in 193 during the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 113&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;

After deposing and killing the incumbent emperor [[Didius Julianus]], Severus fought his rival claimants, the generals [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. Niger was defeated in 194 at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]] in [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 113&quot;/&gt; Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier, annexing the [[Osroene|Kingdom of Osroene]] as a new province.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the [[Battle of Lugdunum]] in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt;

After consolidating his rule over the western provinces, Severus waged another brief, more successful war in the east against the [[Parthian Empire]], sacking their capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he enlarged and fortified the ''[[Limes Arabicus]]'' in [[Arabia Petraea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 134&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt; In 202, he campaigned in Africa and [[Mauretania]] against the [[Garamantes]]; capturing their capital [[Germa|Garama]] and expanding the ''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'' along the southern frontier of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his reign he travelled to [[Roman Britain|Britain]], strengthening [[Hadrian's Wall]] and reoccupying the [[Antonine Wall]]. In 208 he [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208-210|invaded Caledonia]] (modern [[Scotland]]), but his ambitions were cut short when he fell fatally ill in late 210.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;170–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus died in early 211 at [[Eboracum]] (today York, England),&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 187&quot; /&gt; succeeded by his sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]]. With the succession of his sons, Severus founded the [[Severan dynasty]], the last dynasty of the empire before the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].

== Early life ==

=== Family and education ===
Born on 11 April 145 at [[Leptis Magna]] (in present-day [[Libya]]) as the son of [[Publius Septimius Geta (father of Septimius Severus)|Publius Septimius Geta]] and [[Fulvia Pia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 1&quot; /&gt; Septimius Severus came from a wealthy and distinguished family of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank. He had  [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italian]] Roman ancestry on his mother's side and descended from [[Punic]] - and perhaps also [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] - forebears on his father's side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, pp. 212–213&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus' father, an obscure provincial, held no major political status, but he had two cousins, Publius Septimius Aper and Gaius Septimius Severus, who served as consuls under the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (reigned 138-161). His mother's ancestors had moved from [[Italy]] to [[North Africa]]: they belonged to the [[Fulvius|''gens'' Fulvia]], an [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italian]] [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician family]] that originated in [[Tusculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Alexander, ''Classical biography'',[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2UBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=classical+biography+gens+fulvia+cicero+tusculum&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=U0ZYTseHGsmi-gbFrJSuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fulvius%20gens&amp;f=false Google eBook], p.182: ''FULVIUS, the name of a &quot;gens&quot; which originally came from Tusculum (Cic. Planc. 8)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius Severus had two siblings: an older brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta (brother of Septimius Severus)|Publius Septimius Geta]], and a younger sister, Septimia Octavilla. Severus's maternal cousin was [[Praetorian prefect]] and consul [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, pp. 216–217&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;216–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Septimius Severus grew up in his home town of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic language fluently, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education, but according to [[Cassius Dio]] the boy had been eager for more education than he had actually got. Presumably Severus received lessons in [[oratory (worship)|oratory]]: at age 17 he gave his first public speech.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public service ===
[[File:Bronze head of Septimius Severus, from Asia Minor, c. 195-211 AD, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (13648215765).jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze head of Septimius Severus, from Asia Minor, c. 195-211 AD, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen]]
Sometime around 162, Septimius Severus set out for Rome seeking a public career. By recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus, he was granted entry into the senatorial ranks by emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the cursus honorum, and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless, it appears that Severus' career during the 160s was beset with some difficulties.&lt;ref name=birley-40&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that he served as a ''[[vigintisexviri|vigintivir]]'' in Rome, overseeing road maintenance in or near the city, and he may have appeared in court as an advocate.&lt;ref name=birley-40/&gt; At the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius he was the State Attorney (''Advocatus fisci'').&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, London 1870, v. 3, pg. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he omitted the [[Military tribune|military tribunate]] from the cursus honorum and was forced to delay his [[quaestor]]ship until he had reached the required minimum age of 25.&lt;ref name=birley-40/&gt; To make matters worse, the [[Antonine Plague]] swept through the capital in 166.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 45&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his career at a halt, Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis, where the climate was healthier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 45&quot;/&gt; According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', a usually unreliable source, he was prosecuted for adultery during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169, Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5 December, he took office and was officially enrolled in the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 170 and 180 the activities of Septimius Severus went largely unrecorded, in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The [[Antonine Plague]] had severely thinned the senatorial ranks and with capable men now in short supply, Severus' career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have. After his first term as quaestor, he was ordered to serve a second term at [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] (southern Spain),&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; but circumstances prevented Severus from taking up the appointment.

The sudden death of his father necessitated a return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa, [[Mauri people|Mauri]] tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the Emperor, while the Senate gained temporary control of [[Sardinia]] [[Senatorial province|as compensation]]. Thus, Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 173, Severus' kinsman Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed [[proconsul]] of the Africa Province. The elder Severus chose his cousin as one of his two ''[[legatus|legati pro praetore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of this term, Septimius Severus travelled back to Rome, taking up office as [[tribune]] of the plebs, with the distinction of being ''[[candidatus]]'' of the emperor.&lt;ref name=birley-52&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriages ===
[[File:Julia Domna Glyptothek Munich 354.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Julia Domna]], [[Glyptothek]], Munich.]]
[[File:Aureus à l'effigie de Septime Sévère, Julia Domna, Caracalla et Géta.jpg|thumb|Aureus with Septimius Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta]]

Septimius Severus was already in his early thirties at the time of his first marriage. In about 175, he married a woman from Leptis Magna named [[Paccia Marciana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;birley&quot; /&gt; It is likely that he met her during his tenure as [[Legatus|legate]] under his uncle. Marciana's name reveals that she was of Punic or Libyan origin but virtually nothing else is known of her. Septimius Severus does not mention her in his autobiography, though he later commemorated her with statues when he became Emperor. The ''Historia Augusta'' claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters but their existence is nowhere else attested. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children, despite lasting for more than ten years.&lt;ref name=birley-52/&gt;

Marciana died of natural causes around 186.&lt;ref name=birley-75&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius Severus was now in his forties and still childless. Eager to remarry, he began enquiring into the horoscopes of prospective brides. The ''Historia Augusta'' relates that he heard of a woman in Syria who had been foretold that she would marry a king, and therefore Severus sought her as his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;birley&quot;&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt;

This woman was an Emesan [[Syrian]] woman named [[Julia Domna]]. Her father, [[Julius Bassianus]], descended from the royal house of [[Royal family of Emesa|Samsigeramus and Sohaemus]], and served as a high priest to the local cult of the sun god [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabal]].&lt;ref name=birley-72&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Domna's older sister was [[Julia Maesa]], later grandmother to the future emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]].

Bassianus accepted Severus' marriage proposal in early 187, and the following summer he and Julia were married.&lt;ref name=birley-76-77&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage proved to be a happy one and Severus cherished his wife and her political opinions, since she was very well-read and keen on philosophy. Together, they had two sons, [[Caracalla|Lucius Septimius Bassianus]] (later nicknamed Caracalla, ''b.'' 4 April 188) and [[Publius Septimius Geta]] (''b.'' 7 March 189).&lt;ref name=birley-76-77/&gt;

== Rise to power ==
[[File:Severan dynasty - tondo.png|thumb|200px|The [[Severan Tondo]], c. 199, Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta, whose face is erased.]]

In 191 Severus was made governor of [[Pannonia Superior]] by [[Commodus]] at the advice of [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]], prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Bunson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5tic2VunRoC&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;ots=lWjn1A7r7p&amp;dq=commodus%20septimius%20severus%20191&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire|year=2002|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Commodus was assassinated the following year. [[Pertinax]] was acclaimed emperor, but was killed by the Praetorian Guard in early 193. In response to the murder of Pertinax, Severus was proclaimed Emperor at [[Carnuntum]]{{sfn|Campbell|1994|p=40-41}} by his legion ''[[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]]''. Nearby legions, such as ''[[Legio X Gemina|X Gemina]]'' at [[Vindobona]], soon followed.{{sfn|Campbell|1994|p=40-41}} Having assembled an army, Severus hurried to Italy.

Pertinax's successor in Rome was [[Didius Julianus]], who had bought the emperorship in an auction. Julianus was condemned to death by the Senate and killed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/74*.html Roman History], LXXIV.17.4&lt;/ref&gt; and Severus took possession of Rome without opposition. He executed Pertinax's murderers and dismissed the rest of the [[Praetorian Guard]], filling its ranks with loyal troops from his own legions.&lt;ref name=Dio75&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html Roman History], LXXV.1.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The legions of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], however, had proclaimed [[Pescennius Niger]] emperor. At the same time, Severus felt it was reasonable to offer [[Clodius Albinus]], the powerful governor of Britannia who had probably supported Didius against him, the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], which implied some claim to succession. With his rearguard safe, he moved to the East and crushed Niger's forces at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]]. While campaigning against Byzantium he ordered the covering of the tomb of his fellow Carthaginian [[Hannibal]] with fine marble.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Richard A. ''Hannibal: The Military Biography of Rome's Greatest Enemy'', Potomac Books, Inc., 2011 ISBN 1-59797-766-7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=h-VlDC4Jt6gC&amp;pg=PT265&amp;lpg=PT265&amp;dq=severus+byzantium+hannibal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HST8J5ttou&amp;sig=yMX5VdF_dc8z87ThTwVu8VDpYFQ&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PkujUemCGqX44QSr-YAg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year was devoted to suppressing Mesopotamia and other [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] vassals who had backed Niger. When afterwards Severus declared openly his son [[Caracalla]] as successor, Albinus was hailed emperor by his troops and moved to Gallia. Severus, after a short stay in Rome, moved northwards to meet him. On 19 February 197, in the [[Battle of Lugdunum]], with an army of about 75,000 men, mostly composed of [[Pannonia]]n, [[Moesia]]n and [[Dacia]]n legions and most likely a number of Auxiliaries, Severus defeated and killed Clodius Albinus, securing his full control over the Empire.

=== War against Parthia ===

In early 197 he departed Rome and travelled to the east by sea. He embarked at [[Brundisium]] and probably landed at the port of [[Yumurtalık#History|Aegeae]] in [[Cilicia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hasebroek (1921), p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; travelling to [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Life of Septimius Severus&quot; in ''Historia Augusta'', 16.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abgar IX]], King of Osroene but essentially only the ruler of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province, handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus' expedition by providing archers.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time King [[Khosrov I of Armenia]], also sent hostages, money and gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Severus travelled onwards to [[Nisibis]], which his general [[Julius Laetus]] had prevented from falling into enemy hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Prosopographia Imperii Romani'' L 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Severus returned to Syria for a time to plan a much more ambitious campaign.

The following year he led another, more successful campaign against the Parthian Empire, reportedly in retaliation for the support given to Pescennius Niger. The Parthian capital [[Ctesiphon]] was sacked by the legions and the northern half of [[Mesopotamia]] was annexed to the Empire. However, like [[Trajan]] nearly a century before, he was unable to capture the fortress of [[Hatra]] even after two lengthy sieges. During his time in the east he also expanded the ''[[Limes Arabicus]]'', building new fortifications in the [[Arabian Desert]] from [[Qasr Azraq|Basie]] to [[Dumat Al-Jandal|Dumata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999, p. 134&quot; /&gt;

===Relations with the Senate and People===
His relations with the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] were never good. He was unpopular with them from the outset, having seized power with the help of the military, and he returned the sentiment. Severus ordered the execution of a large number of Senators on charges of corruption and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against him, replacing them with his own favourites.

Although his actions turned Rome into a military [[dictatorship]], he was popular with the citizens of Rome, having stamped out the rampant corruption of Commodus's reign. When he returned from his victory over the Parthians, he erected the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome.
According to Cassius Dio,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 76, Sections 14 an 15.&lt;/ref&gt; however, after 197 Severus fell heavily under the influence of his Praetorian Prefect, [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]], who came to have almost total control of most branches of the imperial administration. Plautianus's daughter, [[Fulvia Plautilla]], was married to Severus's son, Caracalla. Plautianus's excessive power came to an end in 204, when he was denounced by the Emperor's dying brother. In January 205, Caracalla accused Plautianus for plotting to kill him and Severus. The powerful prefect was executed while he was trying to defend his case in front of the two emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two following ''praefecti ''was the famous jurist [[Aemilius Papinianus]]. However, executions of senators did not stop: Cassius Dio records that many of them were put to death, some after being formally tried.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military reforms===
Upon his arrival at Rome in 193, he discharged the [[Praetorian Guard]],&lt;ref name=Dio75/&gt; which had murdered Pertinax and had then auctioned the Roman Empire to Didius Julianus. It's members were stripped of their ceremonial armour and forbidden to come within 100 miles of the city on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus replaced the old guard with 10 new cohorts recruited from veterans of his Danubian legions.&lt;ref name=Adkins&gt;Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, Both Professional ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;ots=gqddfw9YPy&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20praetorian%20guard&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome]'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 197,&lt;ref&gt;George Ronald Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PAnmtuOh6K0C&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=nq09eXs4Fm&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20number%20of%20legions&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Roman Soldier], p.23&lt;/ref&gt; he increased the number of legions from 30 to 33, with the introduction of the three new legions I, II, and III ''Parthica'', and he garrisoned [[Legio II Parthica]] at [[Albano Laziale|Albanum]], only 20 kilometers from Rome.&lt;ref name=Adkins/&gt; He gave his soldiers a [[donativum|donative]] of a thousand ''[[sestertius|sesterces]]'' (250 ''[[denarius|denarii]]'') each,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/numismatics/severus.html Septimius Severus:Legionary Denarius]&lt;/ref&gt; and raised the annual wage for a solder in the legions from 300 to 400 ''denarii''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Harl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5yPDL0EykeAC&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;ots=VcHE96FRuM&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20legion%20pay&amp;pg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700, Part 700]'', p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reputed persecution of Christians ===
At the beginning of Severus' reign, [[Trajan|Trajan's]] policy toward the Christians was still valid, that is, Christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out.{{sfn|González|2010|p=97}} Therefore, persecution was inconsistent, local, and sporadic. Faced with internal dissidence and external threats, Severus felt the need to promote religious harmony by promoting [[syncretism]],{{sfn|González|2010|p=97-98}} and by possibly issuing an edict&lt;ref name=HA&gt;''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Septimius_Severus*.html Historia Augusta]'', Septimius Severus, 17.1&lt;/ref&gt; that punished conversion to Judaism and Christianity.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=182-183}}

A number of [[persecution]]s of Christians occurred in the Roman Empire during the reign of Septimius Severus and are traditionally attributed to Severus by the early Christian community.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=182}} This is based on the decree mentioned in the [[Augustan History]],&lt;ref name=HA/&gt; an unreliable mix of fact and fiction.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=184}} Early church historian [[Eusebius]] describes Severus as a persecutor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Tertullian]] states that Severus was well disposed towards Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [[Tertullian]], ''[http://www.tertullian.org/latin/ad_scapulam.htm Ad Scapulam]'', IV.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; employed a Christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from &quot;the mob&quot;.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=184}} Eusebius' description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the ''[[Roman martyrology]]'' as the martyrs of [[Madaurus|Madaura]] and [[Perpetua and Felicity]] in the Roman province of Africa, but these were probably as the result of local persecutions rather than empire-wide actions or decrees by Severus.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=185}}

=== Military activity ===

[[File:Septimius Severus' African conquests1.jpg|thumb|450px|The expansion of the African frontier during the reign of Severus (medium tan). Severus even briefly held a military presence in Garama in 203 (light tan).]]

In late 202 Severus launched a campaign in the province of [[Africa Province|Africa]]. The [[legatus|legate]] of [[Legio III Augusta]] [[Quintus Anicius Faustus]] had been fighting against the [[Garamantes]] along the ''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'' for five years, capturing several settlements from the enemy such as [[Ghadames|Cydamus]], Gholaia, Garbia, and their capital [[Germa|Garama]] – over 600&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Leptis Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the province of [[Numidia]] was also enlarged: the empire annexed the settlements of [[Biskra|Vescera]], [[Messaad|Castellum Dimmidi]], [[M'Lili|Gemellae]], [[Tehouda|Thabudeos]], Thubunae and Zabi&lt;!-- probably simply means &quot;village&quot; in local dialect --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; By 203 the entire southern frontier of Roman Africa had been dramatically expanded and re-fortified. Desert nomads could no longer safely raid the region's interior and escape back into the [[Sahara]].

==== Britain (208) ====
In 208 Severus traveled to Britain with the intention of conquering [[Caledonia]]. Modern archaeological discoveries have made the scope and direction of his northern campaign better understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999 180&quot;&gt;Birley, (1999) p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus probably arrived in Britain possessing an army over 40,000, considering some of the camps constructed during his campaign could house this number.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hanson [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_109/109_140_150.pdf &quot;Roman campaigns north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus: the evidence of the temporary camps&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He strengthened [[Hadrian's Wall]] and reconquered the [[Southern Uplands]] up to the [[Antonine Wall]], which was also enhanced. Severus built a 165-acre camp south of the Antonine Wall at [[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]], probably assembling his forces there. Severus then thrust north with his army across the wall into enemy territory. Retracing the steps of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] over a century previously, Severus rebuilt and garrisoned many abandoned Roman forts along the east coast, including [[Carpow]] which could house up to 40,000 soldiers.

An interesting story from around this time is when Severus' wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of Caledonian chief Argentocoxos replied: &quot;We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html &quot;Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII&quot;] University of Chicago. Retrieved 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassius Dio's account of the invasion reads &quot;Severus, accordingly, desiring to subjugate the whole of it, invaded Caledonia. But as he advanced through the country he experienced countless hardships in cutting down the forests, levelling the heights, filling up the swamps, and bridging the rivers; but he fought no battle and beheld no enemy in battle array. The enemy purposely put sheep and cattle in front of the soldiers for them to seize, in order that they might be lured on still further until they were worn out; for in fact the water caused great suffering to the Romans, and when they became scattered, they would be attacked. Then, unable to walk, they would be slain by their own men, in order to avoid capture, so that a full fifty thousand died. But Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island. Here he observed most accurately the variation of the sun's motion and the length of the days and the nights in summer and winter respectively. Having thus been conveyed through practically the whole of the hostile country (for he actually was conveyed in a covered litter most of the way, on account of his infirmity), he returned to the friendly portion, after he had forced the Britons to come to terms, on the condition that they should abandon a large part of their territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 77 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 210, Severus' campaigning had made significant gains, despite Caledonian guerrilla tactics and purportedly heavy Roman casualties. The Caledonians sued for peace, which Severus granted on condition they relinquish control of the Central Lowlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 1999 180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII.13.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced by extensive Severan era fortifications in the Central Lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999) pp. 180–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caledonians, short on supplies and feeling their position becoming desperate, revolted later that year along with the [[Maeatae]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999) p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus prepared for another protracted campaign within Caledonia. He was now intent on exterminating the Caledonians, telling his soldiers: &quot;Let no one escape sheer destruction, No one our hands, not even the babe in the womb of the mother, If it be male; let it nevertheless not escape sheer destruction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius (Xiphilinus) 'Romaika' Epitome of Book LXXVI Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death (211) ===
Severus' campaign was cut short when he fell fatally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 77, Sections 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew to [[Eboracum]] and died there in 211. Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp. 170–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is famously said to have given the advice to his sons: &quot;Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men&quot; before he died at [[Eboracum]] (York) on 4 February 211.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 77, Section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death in 211, Severus was [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified]] by the Senate and succeeded by his sons, [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], who were advised by his wife [[Julia Domna]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Life of Septimius Severus&quot; in ''Historia Augusta'', Section 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his military expenditure was costly to the empire, Severus was a strong, able ruler. According to [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], &quot;his daring ambition was never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the feelings of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Gibbon|url=http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap5.htm|title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|year=1776|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; His enlargement of the [[Limes Tripolitanus]] secured [[Africa Province|Africa]], the agricultural base of the empire where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D.

In order to maintain his enlarged military he debased the [[Roman currency]] drastically. Upon his accession he decreased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 81.5% to 78.5%. However, the silver weight actually increased, rising from 2.40&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.46&amp;nbsp;grams. Nevertheless, the following year he debased the denarius substantially because of rising military expenditures. The silver purity decreased from 78.5% to 64.5% — the silver weight dropping from 2.46&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.98&amp;nbsp;grams. In 196 he reduced the purity and silver weight of the denarius again, to 54% and 1.82&amp;nbsp;grams respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Severus' currency [[debasement]] was the largest since the reign of [[Nero]], compromising the long-term strength of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Harl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5yPDL0EykeAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700, Part 700]'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus was also distinguished for his buildings. Apart from the [[Arch of Septimius Severus|triumphal arch]] in the Roman Forum carrying his full name, he also built the [[Septizodium]] in Rome and enriched greatly his native city of [[Leptis Magna]] (including another triumphal arch on the occasion of his visit of 203). The greater part of the [[Flavian Palace]] overlooking the [[Circus Maximus]] was undertaken in his reign.

'''Pescennius Niger''' ({{lang-la|Gaius Pescennius Niger Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Niger's name would be inscribed as GAIVS PESCENNIVS NIGER AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 135/140 – 194) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 193 to 194 during the [[Year of the Five Emperors]]. He claimed the imperial throne in response to the murder of [[Pertinax]] and the elevation of [[Didius Julianus]], but was defeated by a rival claimant, [[Septimius Severus]], and killed while attempting to flee from [[Antioch]].

==Early career==
[[File:Denarius-Pescennius Niger-RIC 0015var.jpg|222px|left|thumb|Coin of Pescennius Niger, bearing the inscription (IMPERATOR CAESAR GAIVS PESCENNIVS NIGER IVSTVS AVGVSTVS CONSVL II)]]
Although Niger was born into an old Italian equestrian family, around the year 135,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 101; Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger'', Cassius Dio, 75:6:1&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first member of his family to achieve the rank of [[Roman senator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 101&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known of his early career; it is possible that he held an administrative position in [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]], and that he served in a military campaign in [[Dacia]] early in [[Commodus]]’ reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 180s, Niger was elected as a [[Suffect consul]], after which Commodus made him [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|imperial legate]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] in 191.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''; Southern, pg. 28; Canduci, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

He was still serving in Syria when news came through firstly of the murder of [[Pertinax]], followed by the auctioning off of the imperial title to [[Didius Julianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 2; Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&lt;/ref&gt;  Niger was a well regarded public figure in [[Rome]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&quot;/&gt; and soon a popular demonstration against Didius Julianus broke out, during which the citizens called out for Niger to come to Rome and claim the imperial title for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''; Potter, pg. 101; Bowman, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, it is alleged that Julianus dispatched a [[centurion]] to the east with orders to assassinate Niger at [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 99&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of the unrest in Rome saw Niger proclaimed Emperor by the eastern legions by the end of April 193.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 28; Bowman, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; On his accession, Niger took the additional [[cognomen]] ''Justus'', or &quot;the Just&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&quot;/&gt;  Although imperial propaganda issued on behalf of Septimius Severus later claimed that Niger was the first to rebel against Didius Julianus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 99&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt; it was Severus who beat Niger to it, claiming the imperial title on April 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 101&quot;/&gt; Although Niger sent envoys to Rome to announce his elevation to the imperial throne, his messengers were intercepted by Severus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&quot;/&gt;  As Niger began bolstering his support in the eastern provinces, Severus marched on Rome which he entered in early June 193 after Julianus had been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 4; Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Septimius Severus and Niger ==
{{Year of Five Emperors}}
Severus wasted no time consolidating his hold on Rome, and ordered his newly appointed prefect of the watch, [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]] to capture Niger’s children and hold them as hostages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 103&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Niger was busy securing the support of all of the governors in the [[Asia (Roman province)|Asiatic provinces]], including the esteemed [[proconsul]] of Asia, [[Asellius Aemilianus]], who had occupied [[Byzantium]] in Niger’s name.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 32; Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''&lt;/ref&gt;  Niger then proceeded to secure direct control over [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]], while Severus did as much as he could to protect the wheat supply, and ordered troops loyal to him to keep watch on the western border of Egypt and prevent the legion stationed there [[Legio II Traiana Fortis]] from sending military aid to Niger.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these lands contained great wealth, his military resources were inferior to Severus’. While Severus had the sixteen Danubian legions at his disposal, Niger possessed only six: three in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], the two stationed in [[Arabia Petraea]], and one located at [[Malatya|Melitene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 103&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Niger therefore decided to act aggressively, and sent a force into [[Thrace]] where it defeated a part of Severus’ army under [[Lucius Fabius Cilo]] at [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 104&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus now marched from Rome to the east, sending his general [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 4&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Niger, having made Byzantium his headquarters, gave Asellius Aemilianus the task of defending the southern shore of the [[Sea of Marmara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 4&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  As Severus approached, he offered Niger the opportunity to surrender and go into exile, but Niger refused, trusting in the outcome of a military encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''; Canduci, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 193, Candidus met Aemilianus in battle at [[Battle of Cyzicus (193)|Cyzicus]], resulting in Niger’s forces being defeated as well as the capture and death of Aemilianus.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 4; Potter, pg. 104; Southern, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Byzantium was now placed under siege, forcing Niger to abandon the city and retreat back to [[Nicaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 4&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The city remained loyal to Niger, and it would take Severus until the end of 195 to finally capture Byzantium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 33&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Another battle took place outside of [[Battle of Nicaea|Nicea]] in later December 193, which also resulted in a defeat for Niger. Nevertheless, he was able to withdraw the bulk of his army intact to the [[Taurus Mountains]], where he was able to hold the passes for a few months as Niger returned to Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''; Bowman, pg. 4; Potter, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; However, the problem now for Niger was that his support in Asia was falling. Some cities previously loyal to him decided that it was time to change their allegiance, in particular [[Latakia|Laodicea]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 33&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  By February 13, 194, Egypt had declared for Severus, as had the imperial legate of Arabia, further diminishing Niger’s chances.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 4; Potter, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

After Severus had replaced Candidus with another general, [[Cornelius Anullinus]], Niger met Anullinus in battle at [[Battle of Issus (194)|Issus]] in May 194, where after a long and hard fought struggle, Niger was decisively defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 33; Potter, pg. 104; Bowman, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Forced to retreat to [[Antioch]], Niger was captured while attempting to flee to [[Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Pescennius Niger''; Southern, pg. 33; Canduci, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He was beheaded, and his severed head was taken to Byzantium, but the city refused to surrender. Eventually, Severus stormed and completely destroyed Byzantium before he had it rebuilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 33&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Niger’s head eventually found its way to Rome where it was displayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 104&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

After his victory in the east, Severus punished all of Niger’s supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had Niger’s wife and children put to death, while his estates were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Pescennius Niger'', 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name &quot;Niger&quot; means &quot;black&quot;, which incidentally, contrasts him with one of his rivals for the throne in 194, [[Clodius Albinus]], whose name means &quot;white&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; According to the notoriously unreliable [[Historia Augusta]], his [[cognomen]] of &quot;Niger&quot; was given due to the fact that his neck was black.&lt;ref&gt;Historian Augusta, ''Life of Pegasus Niger'', 6:6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clodius Albinus''' ({{lang-la|Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Albinus' name would be inscribed as DECIMVS CLODIVS SEPTIMIVS ALBINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; ca. 150 &amp;ndash; 19 February 197) was a [[Roman usurper]] who was proclaimed [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] by the legions in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], comprising modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) after the murder of [[Pertinax]] in 193 (known as &quot;[[Year of the Five Emperors]]&quot;), and who proclaimed himself emperor again in 196, before his final defeat the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  |last = Birley  |first = Anthony R.  |author-link = Anthony Birley  |contribution = Clodius Septimius Albinus, Decimus  |editor-last = Hornblower  |editor-first = Simon  |title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  |volume =   |pages =   |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  |place = Oxford  |year = 1996  |contribution-url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Albinus was born in [[Hadrumetum]], [[Africa Province]] ([[Sousse]], [[Tunisia]]) to an aristocratic Roman family of [[Ceionia (gens)]] origin. His father, Ceionius, said his son received the name of Albinus because of the extraordinary whiteness of his complexion.&lt;ref&gt;An universal history, from the earliest accounts to the present time&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;[[Capitolinus]], ''Clodius Albinus'' 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; Showing a disposition for military life, he entered the army when very young and served with distinction, especially in 175 during the rebellion of [[Avidius Cassius]] against Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. His merit was acknowledged by the Emperor in two letters in which he calls Albinus an African, who resembled his countrymen but little, and who was praiseworthy for his military experience and the gravity of his character.&lt;ref name=&quot;cap&quot;/&gt; The Emperor likewise declared that without Albinus the legions (in [[Bithynia]]) would have gone over to [[Avidius Cassius]], and that he intended to have him chosen [[Roman consul|consul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{Citation  |last = Plate  |first = William  |author-link =   |contribution = Albinus, Clodius  |editor-last = Smith  |editor-first = William  |title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  |volume = 1  |pages = 93–94  |publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  |place = Boston  |year = 1867  |contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0102.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor [[Commodus]] gave Albinus a command in [[Gallia Belgica]] and afterwards in [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. A false rumor having been spread that Commodus had died, Albinus denounced the man before his soldiers in Britain, calling Commodus a tyrant, and maintaining that it would be useful to the [[Roman Empire]] to restore to the [[Roman senate|senate]] its ancient dignity and power. The Senate was very pleased with these sentiments, but not so the Emperor, who sent Junius Severus to relieve Albinus of his command. Despite this, Albinus kept his command until after the murders of Commodus and his successor [[Pertinax]] in 193.

==Septimius Severus and Albinus==
[[File:Aureus-Clodius Albinus-RIC 0009b.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Coin of Clodius Albinus&lt;ref&gt;This coin celebrates ''Saeculum Frugiferum'', the embodiment of a &quot;fruitful era&quot;, probably [[Baal Hammon]], a [[Phoenicia]]n divinity worshipped in North Africa, where Clodius came from.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After Pertinax was [[assassination|assassinated]], the [[Praetorian Guard|praetorian prefect]] [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus|Aemilius Laetus]] and his men, who had arranged the murder, &quot;sold&quot; the imperial throne to wealthy senator [[Didius Julianus]], effectively crowning him emperor, but a string of mutinies by the troops in the provinces meant the next Emperor was far from decided. Immediately afterwards, [[Pescennius Niger]] was proclaimed Emperor by the legions in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]; [[Septimius Severus]] by the troops in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]]; and Albinus by the armies in Britain and Gaul.

In the civil war that followed, Albinus was initially allied with Septimius Severus, who had captured [[Rome]]. Albinus added the name Septimius to his own, and accepted the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] from him; the two shared a [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 194. Albinus remained effective ruler of much of the western part of the Empire, with support from three British legions and one Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;The British legions were [[Legio II Augusta|II ''Augusta'']], [[Legio VI Victrix|VI ''Victrix'']], and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], the Spanish legion was the [[legio VII Gemina|VII ''Gemina'']].&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Didius Julianus]] was put to death by order of the Senate, who dreaded the power of Septimius Severus, the latter turned his arms against Pescennius Niger. After the defeat and death of Niger in 194, and the complete discomfiture of his adherents, especially after the fall of [[Byzantium]] in 196, Severus resolved to make himself the absolute master of the Roman Empire. Albinus seeing the danger of his position, prepared for resistance. He narrowly escaped being assassinated by a messenger of Severus, after which he put himself at the head of his army, which is said to have consisted of 150,000 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;cap&quot;/&gt;
{{Year of Five Emperors}}

==Albinus declares himself emperor==

In autumn 196, Albinus proclaimed himself Emperor (''Imperator Caesar Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus Augustus''), crossed from Britain to [[Gaul]], bringing a large part of the British garrison with him.&lt;ref&gt; Indeed, he stripped Britain of every available soldier, which meant that Severus' new administration had to deal with several rebellions, including those of the [[Maeatae]].&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated Severus' legate [[Virius Lupus]], and was able to lay claim to the military resources of Gaul, but although he made [[Lugdunum]] the headquarters of his forces, he was unable to win the allegiance of the Rhine legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

On 19 February 197 Albinus met Severus' army at the [[Battle of Lugdunum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Spartianus]], ''Severus'' 11&lt;/ref&gt; After a hard-fought battle, with 150,000 troops on each side according to [[Dio Cassius]], Albinus was defeated and killed himself, or was captured and executed on the orders of Severus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Collingwood|first1=Robin George|last2=Myres|first2=John Nowell Linton|title=Roman Britain and English Settlements|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fMcbnMFn8lcC|accessdate=January 27, 2009|year=1998|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers|isbn=978-0-8196-1160-4|page=155|chapter=Severeus and Albinus|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=fMcbnMFn8lcC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severus had his naked body laid out on the ground before him, so that he could ride his horse over it, in a final act of humiliation. If Albinus' wife and sons were initially pardoned by Severus, he appeared to almost immediately afterwards change his mind, for as the dead Albinus was beheaded, so were they. Albinus' headless body was thrown into the Rhône, together with the corpses of his murdered family. Severus sent his head to Rome as a warning to his supporters; with it he sent an insolent letter, in which he mocked the senate for their loyalty to Albinus. The town of [[Lugdunum]] was plundered, and the adherents of Albinus were cruelly persecuted by Severus.

Albinus was a severe and often cruel commander, and he has been called the [[Catiline]] of his time. He had one son, or perhaps two, who were executed with their mother by order of Severus. It is said that he wrote a treatise on agriculture and a collection of [[Milesian tale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], lxx. 4—7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodian]], ii. 15, iii. 5—7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caracalla''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|r|ə|ˈ|k|æ|l|ə}}) was the popular nickname of '''Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Augustus'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Caracalla}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4 April AD 188 – 8 April AD 217), [[Roman emperor]] (AD 198–217). The eldest son of [[Septimius Severus]], Caracalla reigned jointly with his father from 198 until Severus' death in 211. For a short time Caracalla then ruled jointly with his younger brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] until Caracalla had Geta murdered later in 211. Caracalla is remembered as one of the most notorious and unpleasant of emperors (according to the literate elite) because of the massacres and persecutions he authorized and instigated throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, P. (2011). [http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/237/ Life of Caracalla] at Ancient History Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Caracalla&quot; ''A Dictionary of British History''. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Caracalla&quot;  ''World Encyclopedia''. Philip's, 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caracalla's reign was also notable for the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' (also called the Edict of Caracalla or the Antonine Constitution), granting [[Roman citizenship]] to all freemen throughout the [[Roman Empire]], which according to the hostile historian [[Cassius Dio]], was done for the purposes of raising tax revenue. This gave all the enfranchised men the two first names of Caracalla &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;. Caracalla also commissioned a large public bath-house ([[thermae]]) project in Rome, and the remains of the [[Baths of Caracalla]] are still one of the major tourist attractions of the Italian capital.

==Early life==
Caracalla, of mixed [[Berbers|Berber]] and [[Syria]]n descent, was born Lucius Septimius Bassianus in [[Lugdunum]], [[Gaul]] (now [[Lyon]], [[France]]), the son of the later Emperor Septimius Severus and [[Julia Domna]]. At the age of seven, his name was changed to Marcus Aurelius Septimius Bassianus Antoninus to create a connection to the family of the philosopher emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. He was later given the [[#His nickname|nickname ''Caracalla'']], which referred to the Gallic hooded tunic he habitually wore and which he made fashionable.

==Reign==

=== Murder of brother (211) ===
His father died in 211 at [[Eboracum]] (now [[York]]) while on campaign in northern Britain. Caracalla was present and was then proclaimed emperor by the troops along with his brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Publius Septimius Antoninus Geta]]. Caracalla suspended the [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208-210|campaign in Caledonia]]  and soon ended all military activity, as both brothers wanted to be sole ruler thus making relations between them increasingly hostile. When they tried to rule the Empire jointly they actually considered dividing it in halves, but were persuaded not to do so by their mother.

Then in December 211 at a reconciliation meeting arranged by their mother [[Julia Domna]], Caracalla had Geta assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard loyal to himself, leading to Geta dying in his mother's arms. Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters and ordered a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory.

Geta's image was simply removed from all coinage, paintings and statues, leaving a blank space next to Caracalla's. Among those executed were his former cousin-wife [[Fulvia Plautilla]], his unnamed daughter with Plautilla along with her brother and other members of the family of his former father-in-law [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]]. Plautianus had already been executed for alleged treachery against emperor Severus in 205.

About the time of his accession he ordered the [[Roman currency]] devalued, the silver purity of the [[denarius]] was decreased from 56.5% to 51.5%, the actual silver weight dropping from 1.81&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.66&amp;nbsp;grams – though the overall weight slightly increased. In 215 he introduced the ''[[antoninianus]]'', a &quot;double denarius&quot; weighing 5.1&amp;nbsp;grams and containing 2.6&amp;nbsp;grams of silver – a purity of 52%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Roman provinces ===
In 213, Caracalla went north to the German frontier to deal with the [[Alamanni]] tribesmen who had broken through the ''[[limes]]'' in the [[Agri Decumates]]. The Romans defeated the Alamanni in battle near the river [[Main (river)|Main]], but failed to win a decisive victory over them. After a peace agreement was brokered and a large bribe payment given to the invaders, the Senate conferred upon him the empty title of ''Germanicus Maximus''. He was also addressed by the surname ''Alemannicus'' at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Everyman's Smaller Classical Dictionary, 1910, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Caracalla traveled to the East, to Syria and Egypt never to return to Rome.

[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in his work describes Caracalla as &quot;the common enemy of mankind&quot;. He left the capital in 213, about a year after the murder of Geta, and spent the rest of his reign in the provinces, particularly those of the East. He kept the Senate and other wealthy families in check by forcing them to construct, at their own expense, palaces, theaters, and places of entertainment throughout the periphery. New and heavy taxes were levied against the bulk of the population, with additional fees and confiscations targeted at the wealthiest families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', Vol. 1. [http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap6.htm Chapter 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with the Macedonian general and conqueror, Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to equip 16,000 men (more than three fully staffed legions) of his army as Macedonian style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the Phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. 
This mania for Alexander went so far in that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign that Caracalla was behaving in an erratic manner. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, G (1967), “The Decadent Emperors, Power &amp; Depravity in Third-Century Rome”, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

When the inhabitants of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] heard Caracalla's claims that he had killed Geta in self-defense, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215, Caracalla savagely responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, and then unleashed his troops for several days of looting and plunder in Alexandria. According to historian Cassius Dio 78, 4, 1, over 20,000 people were killed.

===Influence of Julia Domna ===
While Caracalla was mustering and training troops for his planned Persian invasion, Julia remained in Rome, administering the empire. Julia’s growing influence in state affairs was the beginning of a trend of Emperors’ mothers having influence, which continued throughout the Severan dynasty.
&lt;ref&gt;Grant, M (1996), “The Severans, the Changed Roman Empire”, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestic Roman policy ==

=== Affiliation with the army ===
During his reign as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay of an average legionary to 675 ''[[denarii]]'' and lavished many benefits on the army which he both feared and admired, as instructed by his father Septimius Severus who had told both him and his brother Geta on his deathbed always to mind the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla did manage to win the trust of the military with generous pay raises and popular gestures, like marching on foot among the ordinary soldiers, eating the same food, and even grinding his own flour with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/caracalla.html Caracalla]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the soldiers, &quot;He forgot even the proper dignity of his rank, encouraging their insolent familiarity,&quot; according to Gibbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon&quot;/&gt; &quot;The vigour of the army, instead of being confirmed by the severe discipline of the camps, melted away in the luxury of the cities.&quot;

Seeking to secure his own legacy, Caracalla also commissioned one of Rome's last major architectural achievements, the [[Baths of Caracalla]], the second largest public baths ever built in ancient Rome. The main room of the baths was larger than [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and could easily accommodate over 2,000 Roman citizens at one time. The bath house opened in 216, complete with libraries, private rooms and outdoor tracks. Internally it was lavishly decorated with gold-trimmed marble floors, columns, mosaics and colossal statuary.

===Edict of Caracalla (212)===
The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]] (Latin: &quot;Constitution [or Edict] of Antoninus&quot;) (also called '''Edict of Caracalla''' or '''Antonine Constitution''') was an edict issued in 212 by Caracalla which declared that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Late Antinquity&quot; by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and all free women in the Empire were given the same rights as Roman women.

Before 212, for the most part only inhabitants of Italia held full Roman citizenship. Colonies of Romans established in other provinces, Romans (or their descendants) living in provinces, the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empire, and small numbers of local nobles (such as kings of client countries) held full citizenship also. Provincials, on the other hand, were usually non-citizens, although many held the [[Latin Right]].

The Roman Historian [[Cassius Dio]] contended that the sole motivation for the edict was a desire to increase state revenue, coupled with the debasement of the currency, needed to pay for the new pay raises and benefits conferred on the  military.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the time aliens did not have to pay most taxes that were required of citizens, so although nominally Caracalla was elevating their legal status, he was more importantly expanding the Roman tax base. The effect of this was to remove the distinction that citizenship had held since the foundation of Rome and as such the act had a profound effect upon the fabric of Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Leithart|Leithart, P.]] (2010), ''[[Defending Constantine|Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom]]'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

== War with Parthia ==
Caracalla pursued a series of aggressive campaigns in the east, designed to bring more territory under direct Roman control. He attempted to find pretexts for invading Parthia, culminating in a proposal of marriage between himself and the daughter of king [[Artabanus V of Parthia]]. According to the historian Herodian, in 216, Caracalla tricked the Parthians into believing that he was sincere in his marriage and peace proposal, but then attacked the bride and guests at the wedding celebrations. Artabanus barely escaped. His daughter and many high ranking Parthians were massacred. The thereafter ongoing conflict and skirmishes became known as the [[Parthian war of Caracalla]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodian's ''Roman History'', chapter 4.11: ''Caracalla's Parthian War'', translated by Edward C. Echols (''Herodian of Antioch's History of the Roman Empire'', 1961 Berkeley and Los Angeles), [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre411.html online at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination (217)===
[[File:Roman Empire in 210 AD.png|thumb|350px|The Roman Empire during the reign of Caracalla.]]
While travelling from [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] to continue the war with [[Parthia]], he was assassinated while urinating at a roadside near [[Carrhae]] (now [[Harran]] in southern Turkey) on 8 April 217 (4 days after his 29th birthday), by Julius Martialis, an officer of his personal bodyguard. [[Herodian]] says that Martialis's brother had been executed a few days earlier by Caracalla on an unproven charge; [[Cassius Dio]], on the other hand, says that Martialis was resentful at not being promoted to the rank of centurion. The escort of the emperor gave him privacy to relieve himself, and Martialis then ran forward and killed Caracalla with a single sword stroke. While attempting to flee, the bold assassin was then quickly dispatched by a Scythian archer of the Imperial Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon&quot;/&gt;

Caracalla was succeeded by his [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Guard Prefect]], [[Macrinus]], who (according to Herodian) was most probably responsible for having the emperor assassinated.

==His nickname== &lt;!-- do not rename section w/o fixing reference in intro --&gt;
According to [[Aurelius Victor]] in his ''Epitome de Caesaribus'', the [[agnomen]] &quot;Caracalla&quot; refers to a Gallic [[cloak]] that Caracalla adopted as a personal fashion, which spread to his army and his court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/victor_ep.html#21 21] ([http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm translation]). For information on the ''caracallus'' garment, see [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Caracalla.html &quot;Caracalla&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-3 79.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Caracalla'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html#9.7 9.7], ''Septimius Severus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Septimius_Severus*.html#21.11 21.11]&lt;/ref&gt; agree that his nickname was derived from his cloak, but do not mention its country of origin.

==Portrait==
[[File:Roman - Medallion with Roman Emperor Caracalla - Walters 593 - Obverse.jpg|thumb|This medallion exemplifies the typical manner in which Caracalla was depicted. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

His official portraiture as sole emperor marks a break with the detached images of the philosopher–emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier–emperor iconic archetype was adopted by most of the following emperors who depended on the support of the troops to rule, such as [[Maximinus Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/eust/ho_40.11.1a.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art: Portrait head of the Emperor Caracalla&quot;. acc. no. 40.11.1a]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodian]] describes Caracalla as not tall, but robust. He preferred Northern European clothing, ''caracalla'' being the name of the short Gaulish cloak that he made fashionable, and often wore a blond wig.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian 4,7 and 4,9,3.&lt;/ref&gt; Vgl. Cassius Dio 79 (78),9,3: Cassius Dio mentions that the emperor liked to show a &quot;wild&quot; facial expression.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 78 (77),11,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can see how he wanted to be portrayed to his people through many surviving busts and [[coins]]. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be well distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins the older brother Caracalla was however shown with laureate since becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until himself becoming Augustus in 209.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andreas Pangerl 2013&quot;&gt;Andreas Pangerl: Porträttypen des Caracalla und des Geta auf Römischen Reichsprägungen - Definition eines neuen Caesartyps des Caracalla und eines neuen Augustustyps des Geta; Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt des RGZM Mainz 43, 2013, 1, 99–116&lt;/ref&gt; Especially between 209 and their father's death in February  211 both brothers are shown as mature young men, ready to take over the empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of  Geta towards the end of 211 Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard, while Geta develops a long beard with [[hair]] strains like his father, a strong indicator for the effort to be seen as the &quot;true&quot; successor to their father. The brutal murder of Geta made this claim obsolete of course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andreas Pangerl 2013&quot;/&gt;

==Legendary king of Britain==
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s legendary ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' makes Caracalla a king of Britain, referring to him by his actual name &quot;Bassianus&quot;, rather than the nickname Caracalla. In the story, after Severus's death the Romans wanted to make Geta king of Britain, but the Britons preferred Bassianus because he had a British mother. The two brothers fought a battle in which Geta was killed and Bassianus succeeded to the throne. He ruled until he was betrayed by his [[Picts|Pictish]] allies and overthrown by [[Carausius]], who, according to Geoffrey, was a Briton, rather than the historically much later [[Menapii|Menapian]] Gaul that he actually was.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5#2|5.2–3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrinus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Macrinus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS OPELLIVS SEVERVS MACRINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; {{c.|165}} – June 218), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 217 to 218. Macrinus' origin was Mauretanian,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Macrinus, by 
race a Moor, from Caesarea... one of his ears had been bored in 
accordance with the custom followed by most of the Moors&quot;, [[Cassius Dio]], ''Dio's Rome (bk 79)'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, v.6, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; probably of mixed extraction with Punic or Punicized elements.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Scott, ''Change and Discontinuity Within the Severan Dynasty: The Case of Macrinus'', ProQuest, 2008, ISBN

9780549890416, p. 53
&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the [[Equestrian order|equestrian class]] he became the first emperor who did not hail from the [[Roman Senate|senatorial class]].

Macrinus was overthrown and executed in 218.

==Background and career==
Born in [[Caesarea Mauretaniae]] (modern [[Cherchell]], Algeria) in the [[Roman province]] of [[Mauretania]] to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family, Macrinus received an education which allowed him to ascend to the Roman political class. Over the years he earned a reputation as a skilled lawyer, and under the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] he became an important bureaucrat. Severus' successor [[Caracalla]] appointed him [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]].

While Macrinus probably enjoyed the trust of Caracalla, this may have changed when, according to tradition, it was prophesied that he would depose and succeed the Emperor, and rumors spread regarding his alleged desire to take the throne for himself. Given Caracalla's tendency toward murdering political opponents, Macrinus probably feared for his own safety should the Emperor become aware of this prophecy. According to [[Dio Cassius]], Caracalla had already taken the step of reassigning members of Macrinus' staff.

In the spring of 217, Caracalla was in the eastern provinces preparing a campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Macrinus was among his staff, as were other members of the Praetorian Guard. In April, the Emperor went to visit a temple of [[Selene|Luna]] near the spot of the [[battle of Carrhae]], accompanied only by his personal bodyguard, which included Macrinus. Events are not clear, but it is certain that Caracalla was murdered at some point on the trip (perhaps on April 8).

Caracalla's body was brought back from the temple by his bodyguards, along with the corpse of a fellow bodyguard. The story as told by Macrinus was that the dead guard had killed Caracalla. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor, and also nominated his son [[Diadumenianus]] ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and successor; he conferred upon him the name &quot;Antoninus&quot;, thus connecting him with the relatively stable reigns of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Antonine emperors]] in the 2nd century.

==Reign (April 217 – June 218)==
Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was confirmed in his new role by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. According to S.N. Miller, this may have been due to both his background as an accomplished jurist and his deferential treatment of the senatorial class. He found it necessary, however, to replace several provincial governors with men of his own choosing. Caracalla's mother [[Julia Domna]] was initially left in peace, but when she started to conspire with the military he ordered her to leave [[Antioch]]. Being at that time in an advanced stage of breast cancer (Cassius Dio) she chose instead to starve herself to death.

In urgent matters of foreign policy, Macrinus displayed a tendency towards conciliation and a reluctance to engage in military conflict. He averted trouble in the province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] by returning hostages that had been held by Caracalla, and he ended troubles in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] by granting that country's throne to [[Tiridates II of Armenia|Tiridates]], whose father had also been imprisoned under Caracalla. Less easily managed was the problem of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], which had been invaded by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] in the wake of Caracalla's demise. Meeting the Parthians in battle during the summer of 217, Macrinus achieved a [[Battle of Nisibis (217)|costly draw]] near the town of [[Nisibis]] and as a result was forced to enter negotiations through which Rome was obliged to pay the enormous [[indemnity]] of 200 million sesterces to the Parthian ruler [[Artabanus V of Parthia|Artabanus V]] in return for peace.

Macrinus displayed some financial farsightedness{{fact|date=August 2014}} when he revalued the [[Roman currency]]. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 51.5% to 58% — the actual silver weight increasing from 1.66&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.82&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrinus' reluctance to engage in warfare, and his failure to gain victory over the Parthians caused considerable resentment among the soldiers. This was compounded by him curtailing the privileges they had enjoyed under Caracalla and the introduction of a pay system by which recruits received less than veterans. After only a short while, the legions were searching for a rival emperor.

At a high point of his popularity monuments were built to honour Macrinus, including the grand [[tetrastyle]] [[Capitoline Temple]], in [[Volubilis]] was erected in 217 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, edited by A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

His popularity also suffered in Rome. Not only had the new emperor failed to visit the city after taking power but a late-summer thunderstorm caused widespread fires and flooding. Macrinus' appointee as urban prefect proved unable to repair the damage to the satisfaction of the populace and had to be replaced.

==Downfall==
[[File:Aureus Macrinus-RIC 0079.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[aureus]] of Macrinus. Its elaborate symbolism celebrates the ''[[liberalitas]]'' (&quot;prodigality&quot;) of Macrinus and his son [[Diadumenian]].]]
This discontent was fostered by the surviving members of the [[Severan dynasty]], headed by [[Julia Maesa]] (Caracalla's aunt) and her daughters [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Julia Mamaea]]. Having been evicted from the imperial palace and ordered to return home by Macrinus, the Severan women plotted from their home near [[Emesa]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] to place another Severan on the imperial throne.

They used their hereditary influence over the cult of [[solar deity|sun-deity]] Elagabalus (the Latinised form of [[El-Gabal]]) to proclaim Soaemias' son [[Elagabalus]] (named for his family's patron deity) as the true successor to Caracalla. The rumor was spread, with the assistance of the Severan women, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's illegitimate son and thus the child of a union between first cousins.

===Execution (218)===
On May 18, Elagabalus was proclaimed emperor by the [[Legio III Gallica|Legio III ''Gallica'']] at its camp at [[Raphana]]. A force under his tutor Gannys marched on [[Antioch]] and engaged a force under Macrinus on June 8, 218. Macrinus, deserted by most of his soldiers, was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|battle]] and fled by sea towards Italy disguised as a courier.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He was captured near [[Chalcedon]] and later executed in [[Cappadocia]]. His son [[Diadumenian]], sent for safety to the Parthian court, was captured at [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] and also murdered.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Macrinus' short reign, while important for its historical &quot;firsts&quot;, was cut short due to the inability of this otherwise accomplished man to control or satisfy the soldiery.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In his death at the hands of his own troops, Macrinus reinforces the notion of the soldiers as the true brokers of power in the third-century empire and highlighted the importance of maintaining the support of this vital faction.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} His reign was followed by another seventeen years of rule under the Severan emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Severus Alexander]].

'''Elagabalus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|g|æ|b|əl|ə|s}} or '''Heliogabalus''' ({{lang-el|Μάρκος Αυρήλιος Αντωνίνος Αύγουστος}}; {{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus}}; {{circa}} 203 – March 11, 222), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 218 to 222. A member of the [[Severan Dynasty]], he was [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]], the second son of [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]]. In his early youth he served as a priest of the god [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabal]] (in Latin, ''Elagabalus'') in the hometown of his mother's family, [[Emesa]]. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of his nomenclature, see Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, ''Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus. He was called Elagabalus only after his death.&lt;ref&gt;First by the fourth-century author [[Aurelius Victor]] ''Liber de Caesaribus'' (23.1) [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#23]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 217, the emperor [[Caracalla]] was [[assassination|assassinated]] and replaced by his [[Praetorian prefect]], [[Macrinus|Marcus Opellius Macrinus]]. Caracalla's maternal aunt, [[Julia Maesa]], successfully instigated a revolt among the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] to have her eldest grandson (and Caracalla's cousin), Elagabalus, declared emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on 8 June 218, at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]]. Elagabalus, barely fourteen years old, became emperor, initiating a reign remembered mainly for [[sexual scandal]] and religious controversy.

Later historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], with the deity of whom he was high priest, [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabal]]. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, over which he personally presided. Elagabalus was married as many as five times, lavished favours on male courtiers popularly thought to have been his lovers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StIqd8etrLoC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Whoopee+cushion+elagabalus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tZB-TOvsB5CTjAfQ05zzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=whoopee&amp;f=false |title=Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire |first1=Warwick |last1=Ball |authorlink=Warwick Ball |place=London New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |page=412 |isbn=0-415-24357-2 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://focreviews.blogspot.com/2011/09/crimes-of-elagabalus-by-martjin-icks.html |date=15 September 2011 |title=The Crimes of Elagabalus |first1=Martjin |last1=Icks |publisher=Literary Review |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reported to have prostituted himself in the imperial palace. His behavior estranged the [[Praetorian Guard]], the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and the common people alike.

Amidst growing opposition, Elagabalus, just 18 years old, was assassinated and replaced by his cousin [[Alexander Severus]] on 11 March 222, in a plot formulated by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard.

Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]], [[decadence]] and [[zealotry]].&lt;ref name=emperorsatbay&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire at Bay: Ad 180–395 |first=David Stone |last=Potter |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-10057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has persisted, and in writers of the early modern age he suffers one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. [[Edward Gibbon]], for example, wrote that Elagabalus &quot;abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures and ungoverned fury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|B.G. Niebuhr]], &quot;The name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others&quot; because of his &quot;unspeakably disgusting life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, B.G. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofrome001903mbp History of Rome]'', p. 144 (1844). Elagabalus' vices were &quot;too disgusting even to allude to them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and priesthood==
{{Further|Severan dynasty family tree}}
{{Severan dynasty}}
Elagabalus was born around the year 203&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre503.html V.3]&lt;/ref&gt; to a Greek father, [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]] and [[Julia Soaemias|Julia Soaemias Bassiana]]. His father was initially a member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, but was later elevated to the rank of [[Roman Senate|senator]]. His grandmother [[Julia Maesa]] was the widow of the [[Roman consul|consul]] Gaius [[Julius Avitus]] Alexianus, the sister of [[Julia Domna]], and the sister-in-law of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxix-30&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 LXXIX.30]&lt;/ref&gt; He had at least one sibling: an unnamed elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor'', p.p.217&amp;222-223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/va-vh/varius/varius_marcellus.html Sextus Varius Marcellus' article at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Julia Soaemias, was a cousin of the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]]. Other relatives included his aunt [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] and uncle [[Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus]] and among their children, their son [[Alexander Severus]]. Elagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal, of whom Elagabalus was the [[high priest]] at Emesa (modern [[Homs]]) in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;

The deity [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]] was initially venerated at Emesa. This form of the god's name is a Latinized version of the Syrian ''Ilāh hag-Gabal'', which derives from [[El (god)|''Ilāh'']] (a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word for &quot;god&quot;) and ''gabal'' (an [[Aramaic]] word for &quot;mountain&quot;), resulting in &quot;the God of the Mountain,&quot; the Emesene manifestation of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Lenormant |first = Francois |authorlink = François Lenormant |title = Sol Elagabalus |journal = Revue de l'Histoire des Religions |volume = 3 |page = 310 |year = 1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of the deity spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century; a dedication has been found as far away as [[Woerden]] ([[Netherlands]]), near the Roman ''limes''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/woerden-elagabal.html An Early Dedication to Elagabal]&quot; at [[Livius.org]]; the inscription is in now in Woerden's [http://www.stadsmuseumwoerden.nl/ city museum].&lt;/ref&gt; The god was later imported and assimilated with the Roman sun god known as [[Sol Indiges]] in [[Roman Republic|republican]] times and as [[Sol Invictus]] during the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Devlaminck, Pieter |title = De Cultus van Sol Invictus: Een vergelijkende studie tussen keizer Elagabalus (218–222) en keizer Aurelianus (270–275) |publisher = University of Ghent |year = 2004 |language = Dutch |url = http://www.ethesis.net/invictus/invictus_inhoud.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek the sun god is [[Helios]], hence &quot;Heliogabalus&quot;, a variant of &quot;Elagabalus&quot;.

==Rise to power==

When the emperor [[Macrinus]] came to power, he suppressed the threat against his reign by the family of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them—Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus—to their estate at Emesa in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt; Almost upon arrival in Syria, Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabalus' tutor Gannys, to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus to the imperial throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;

His mother publicly declared that he was the illegitimate son of Caracalla, therefore due the loyalties of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt; After Julia Maesa displayed her wealth to the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] at [[Raphana]] they swore allegiance to Elagabalus. At sunrise on 16 May 218, [[Publius Valerius Comazon]], commander of the legion, declared him emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-31 LXXIX.31]&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen his legitimacy through further propaganda, Elagabalus assumed Caracalla's names, ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-32 LXXIX.32]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response Macrinus dispatched his [[Praetorian prefect]] Ulpius Julianus to the region with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough to crush the [[rebellion]]. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head was sent back to the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre504.html V.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrinus now sent letters to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] denouncing Elagabalus as the ''False Antoninus'' and claiming he was insane.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-36 LXXIX.36]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Roman consul|consul]]s and other high-ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned Elagabalus, and the Senate subsequently declared war on both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-38 LXXIX.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrinus and his son, weakened by the desertion of the [[Legio II Parthica|Second Legion]] due to bribes and promises circulated by Julia Maesa, were defeated on 8 June 218 at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]] by troops commanded by Gannys.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt; Macrinus fled toward [[Italy]], disguised as a courier, but was later intercepted near [[Chalcedon]] and executed in [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt; His son [[Diadumenianus]], sent for safety to the [[Parthia]]n court, was captured at [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] and also put to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt;

Elagabalus declared the date of the victory at Antioch to be the beginning of his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior senatorial approval,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-2&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-2 LXXX.2]&lt;/ref&gt; which violated tradition but was a common practice among 3rd-century emperors nonetheless. Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to [[Rome]] extending [[amnesty]] to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-1 LXXX.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The senators responded by acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting his claim to be the son of Caracalla.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre505.html V.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Caracalla and Julia Domna were both [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|deified]] by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustae]],&lt;ref name=&quot;benario-soamias-mamaea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Benario |first = Herbert W. |title = The Titulature of Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea: Two Notes |journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume = 90 |pages = 9–14 |year = 1959 |doi = 10.2307/283691 |publisher = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 90 |jstor=283691}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the memory of both Macrinus and Diadumenianus was condemned by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-2&quot;/&gt; The former commander of the Third Legion, Comazon, was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-4&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-4 LXXX.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor (218–222)==
[[Image:Elagabalus Denarius Fortuna Head.png|thumb|right|A [[denarius]] commissioned by Elagabalus, bearing his likeness]]

Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218 in [[Bithynia]] at [[Nicomedia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; where the emperor's religious beliefs first presented themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian [[Cassius Dio]] suggests that Gannys was in fact killed by the new emperor because he was forcing Elagabalus to live &quot;temperately and prudently.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-6&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-6 LXXX.6]&lt;/ref&gt; To help Romans adjust to the idea of having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] in the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; This placed senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.

The legions were dismayed by his behaviour and quickly came to regret having supported his accession.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; While Elagabalus was still on his way to Rome, brief revolts broke out by the [[Legio IV Scythica|Fourth Legion]] at the instigation of [[Gellius Maximus]], and by the Third Legion, which itself had been responsible for the elevation of Elagabalus to the throne, under the command of Senator [[Verus (senator)|Verus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-7&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-7 LXXX.7]&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third Legion disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = van Zoonen |first = Lauren |title = Heliogabalus |url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/heliogabalus/heliogabalus2.html#Life1 |year = 2005 |publisher = livius.org |accessdate = 2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the entourage reached Rome in the autumn of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given powerful and lucrative positions, to the outrage of many senators who did not consider them worthy of such privileges.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre507.html V.7]&lt;/ref&gt; After his tenure as [[Praetorian prefect]], Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as [[Roman consul|consul]] twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-4&quot;/&gt; Elagabalus soon devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the ''[[denarius]]'' from 58% to 46.5%&amp;nbsp;— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.41&amp;nbsp;grams. He also demonetized the ''[[antoninianus]]'' during this period in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elagabalus tried to have his presumed lover, the charioteer [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], declared [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-15 LXXX.15]&lt;/ref&gt; while another alleged lover, the athlete Aurelius Zoticus, was appointed to the non-administrative but influential position of Master of the Chamber, or ''[[Cubicularius]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-16&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-16 LXXX.16]&lt;/ref&gt; His offer of amnesty for the Roman upper class was largely honoured, though the [[jurist]] [[Ulpian]] was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#16 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His mother and grandmother became the first women to be allowed into the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;augusta-elagabalus-i-4&quot;&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#4 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of ''Clarissima,'' and Maesa the more unorthodox ''Mater Castrorum et Senatus'' (&quot;Mother of the army camp and of the Senate&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;benario-soamias-mamaea&quot;/&gt; While Julia Maesa tried to position herself as the power behind the throne and thus the most powerful woman in the world, Elagabalus would prove to be highly independent, set in his ways, and impossible to control.

===Religious controversy===
[[Image:Elagabalus Aureus Sol Invictus.png|thumb|310px|A Roman [[aureus]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Sanct(o) Deo Soli Elagabal(o)'' (''To the Holy Sun God Elagabalus''), and depicts a [[quadriga|four-horse]], gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the [[Emesa]] temple.]]

Since the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], [[sun worship]] had increased throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Halsberghe |first = Gaston H. |title = The Cult of Sol Invictus |year = 1972 |location = Leiden |page = 36|publisher= Brill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elagabalus saw this as an opportunity to install Elagabal as the chief deity of the [[Roman pantheon]]. The god was renamed ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'', meaning ''God the Undefeated Sun'', and honored above [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-11&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a token of respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]], [[Urania]], or some combination of the three to Elagabal as wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6]&lt;/ref&gt; Before constructing a temple in dedication to Elagabal, Elagabalus placed the meteorite of Elagabal next to the throne of Jupiter at the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

He stirred further discontent when he himself married the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa]], claiming the marriage would produce &quot;godlike children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-9 LXXX.9]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a flagrant breach of Roman law and tradition, which held that any Vestal found to have engaged in sexual intercourse was to be [[buried alive]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', Life of Numa Pompilius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lavish temple called the [[Elagabalium]] was built on the east face of the [[Palatine Hill]] to house Elagabal, who was represented by a black conical [[Baetylus|meteorite]] from Emesa.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; [[Herodian]] wrote &quot;this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;

In order to become the high priest of his new religion, Elagabalus had himself circumcised.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-11&quot;/&gt; He forced senators to watch while he danced around the altar of Deus Sol Invictus to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; Each summer [[solstice]] he held a festival dedicated to the god, which became popular with the masses because of the free food distributed on such occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; During this festival, Elagabalus placed the Emesa stone on a [[chariot]] adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city:

{{quote|A six horse chariot carried the divinity, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses' reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face of his god.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt;}}

The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the emblem of the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the [[Ancile|Shields]] of the [[Salii]] and the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], so that no other god could be worshipped except in company with Elagabal.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex/gender controversy===
[[Image:Aquilia Severa coin obverse.png|thumb|right|Roman denarius depicting [[Aquilia Severa]], the second wife of Elagabalus. The marriage caused a public outrage because Aquilia was a [[Vestal Virgin]], sworn by Roman law to [[celibacy]] for 30 years.]]

Elagabalus' [[sexual orientation]] is the subject of much debate. Elagabalus married and divorced five women,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;/&gt; three of whom are known. His first wife was [[Julia Cornelia Paula]];&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; the second was the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa|Julia Aquilia Severa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt;

Within a year, he abandoned her and married [[Annia Faustina|Annia Aurelia Faustina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; a descendant of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the widow of a man recently executed by Elagabalus. He had returned to his second wife Severa by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;/&gt; According to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], whom he referred to as his husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;/&gt;

The ''Augustan History'' claims that he also married a man named Zoticus, an athlete from Smyrna, in a public ceremony at Rome.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio reported that Elagabalus would paint his eyes, [[plucking (hair removal)|epilate]] his hair and wear wigs before [[prostitution|prostituting]] himself in taverns, brothels,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-14 LXXX.14]&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the imperial palace:

{{quote|Finally, he set aside a room in the palace and there committed his indecencies, always standing nude at the door of the room, as the harlots do, and shaking the curtain which hung from gold rings, while in a soft and melting voice he solicited the passers-by. There were, of course, men who had been specially instructed to play their part. For, as in other matters, so in this business, too, he had numerous agents who sought out those who could best please him by their foulness. He would collect money from his patrons and give himself airs over his gains; he would also dispute with his associates in this shameful occupation, claiming that he had more lovers than they and took in more money.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-13 LXXX.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodian commented that Elagabalus enhanced his natural good looks by the regular application of cosmetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; He was described as having been &quot;delighted to be called the mistress, the wife, the queen of Hierocles&quot; and was reported to have offered vast sums of money to any physician who could equip him with female genitalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-16&quot;/&gt; Elagabalus has been characterized by some modern writers as [[transgender]], perhaps [[transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Benjamin |first = Harry |last2 = Green |first2 = Richard |title = The Transsexual Phenomenon, Appendix C: Transsexualism: Mythological, Historical, and Cross-Cultural Aspects. |publisher = The Julian Press, inc |year = 1966 |location = New York |url = http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717204538/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm |archivedate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq-enc-elagabal&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Godbout |first = Louis |title = Elagabalus |encyclopedia = GLBTQ: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |publisher = glbtq, Inc |location = Chicago |year = 2004 |url = http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/elagabalus.html |accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Varner |first =Eric |title =Transcending Gender: Assimilation, Identity, and Roman Imperial Portraits |journal =Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome.

===Fall from power===
By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, particularly his relationship with Hierocles,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;/&gt; increasingly provoked the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided that he and his mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, [[Julia Avita Mamaea]], and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old [[Severus Alexander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt;

Prevailing on Elagabalus, she arranged that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir and be given the title of ''Caesar''. Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin over himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre508.html V.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of various attempts on Alexander's life, Elagabalus stripped his cousin of his titles, revoked his consulship, and circulated the news that Alexander was near death, in order to see how the Praetorians would react.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt; A riot ensued, and the guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt;

==== Assassination ====
The emperor complied and on 11 March 222 he publicly presented his cousin along with his own mother, Julia Soaemias. On their arrival the soldiers started cheering Alexander while ignoring Elagabalus, who ordered the summary arrest and execution of anyone who had taken part in this display of insubordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt; In response, members of the [[Praetorian Guard]] attacked Elagabalus and his mother:

{{quote|So he made an attempt to flee, and would have got away somewhere by being placed in a chest, had he not been discovered and slain, at the age of 18. His mother, who embraced him and clung tightly to him, perished with him; their heads were cut off and their bodies, after being stripped naked, were first dragged all over the city, then the mother's body was cast aside somewhere or other while his was thrown into the [Tiber].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-20&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-20 LXXX.20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his assassination, many associates of Elagabalus were killed or deposed, including his lover [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-20&quot;/&gt; His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal was sent back to [[Emesa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-vi-1&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre601.html VI.6]&lt;/ref&gt; Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;augusta-elagabalus-i-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hay |first = J.

==Sources==

===Augustan History===
The source of many of these stories of Elagabalus's depravity is the ''[[Augustan History]]'' (''Historia Augusta''), which includes controversial claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Syme |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Syme |title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' |year = 1971 |location = Oxford |publisher = Clarendon Press |page = 218 |isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia Augusta'' was most likely written toward the end of the 4th century during the reign of emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Cizek |first = Eugen |title = Histoire et historiens à Rome dans l'Antiquité |year = 1995 |location = Lyon |publisher = Presses universitaires de Lyon |page = 297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Elagabalus as described in the ''Augustan History'' is of uncertain historical merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Syme |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Syme |title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' |year = 1971 |location = Oxford |publisher = Clarendon Press |page = 263 |isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Butler |first = Orma Fitch |title = Studies in the life of Heliogabalus |journal = University of Michigan studies: Humanistic series IV |year = 1910 |location = New York |publisher = MacMillan |page = 140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Dio===
Sources often considered more credible than the ''Augustan History'' include the contemporary historians [[Cassius Dio]] and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived from the second half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor [[Commodus]] and governor of [[Smyrna]] after the death of [[Septimius Severus]]. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in [[Africa province|Africa]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter 80.18&quot;&gt;chapter 80.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Severus held him in high esteem and made him his consul again. His ''Roman History'' spans nearly a [[millennium]], from the arrival of [[Aeneas]] in Italy until the year 229. As a contemporary of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the ''Augustan History'', although by his own admission&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter 80.18&quot;/&gt; Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand accounts.

Furthermore, the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander, likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as [[Sardanapalus]], partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake,&lt;ref&gt;80.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' enforced after the emperor's death and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Syme |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Syme |title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' |year = 1971 |location = Oxford |publisher = Clarendon Press |pages = 145–146 |isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian===
[[File:Medal of Elagabalus.jpg|thumb|250px|Medal of Elagabalus, [[Louvre Museum]].]]

Another contemporary of Elagabalus was [[Herodian]], who was a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c. 170 until 240. His work, ''History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius'', commonly abbreviated as ''Roman History'', is an eyewitness account of the reign of [[Commodus]] until the beginning of the reign of [[Gordian III]]. His work largely overlaps with Dio's own ''Roman History'', but both texts seem to be independently consistent with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius-herodian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Lendering |first = Jona |authorlink = Jona Lendering |title = Herodian |year = 2004 |url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/herodian.html |publisher = Livius.org |accessdate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Herodian is not deemed as reliable as Cassius Dio, his lack of literary and scholarly pretensions make him less biased than senatorial historians. Herodian is considered the most important source for the religious reforms which took place during the reign of Elagabalus, which have been confirmed by [[numismatics|numismatic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Cohen |first = Henry |authorlink = Henry Cohen (numismatist) |title = Description Historiques des Monnaies Frappées sous l'Empire Romain (8 volumes) |year = 1880–1892 |location = Paris |page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = [[Ernest Babelon|Babelon]] |first = Ernest Charles François |title = Monnaies Consulaires II |year = 1885–1886 |location = Bologna |publisher = Forni |pages = 63–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', {{CIL|02|1409}}, {{CIL|02|1410}}, {{CIL|02|1413}}, and CIL III: 564-589.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edward Gibbon and later historians====
For readers of the modern age, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737–94) further cemented the scandalous reputation of Elagabalus. Gibbon not only accepted and expressed outrage at the allegations of the ancient historians, but might have added some details of his own; he is the first historian known to state that Gannys was a eunuch, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, [http://www.cambridge.org/servlet/file/8871_Pseudo-eunuchs%20in%20the%20court%20of%20Elagabalus.pdf?ITEM_ENT_ID=5947092&amp;ITEM_VERSION=1&amp;COLLSPEC_ENT_ID=842&amp;download=1 &quot;Pseudo-Eunuchs in the Court of Elagabalus,&quot;] 1999, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon wrote:

{{quote|To confound the order of the season and climate, to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred asylum, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex, preferring the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, the empress's husband. It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice. Yet, confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Two hundred years after the age of Pliny, the use of pure, or even of mixed silks, was confined to the female sex, till the opulent citizens of Rome and the provinces were insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus, the first who, by this effeminate habit, had sullied the dignity of an emperor and a man.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XL.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some recent historians argue for a more favourable picture of his life and reign. Martijn Icks in ''Images of Elagabalus'' (2008; republished as ''The Crimes of Elagabalus'' in 2012) doubts the reliability of the ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in ''The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'' (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality played a role in the fall of the young emperor, who was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. According to this version, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a wholesale propaganda war against his memory resulted in a vicious caricature which has persisted to the present, repeated and often embellished by later historians displaying their own prejudices against effeminacy and other vices which Elagabalus had come to epitomize.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Elagabalus Forchtenstein.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Elagabalus on a wall painting at [[Forchtenstein Castle]] ]]

Due to the ancient tradition about him, Elagabalus became something of an (anti-)hero in the [[Decadent movement]] of the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq-enc-elagabal&quot;/&gt; He often appears in literature and other creative media as the epitome of a young, amoral aesthete. His life and character have informed or at least inspired many famous works of art, by Decadents, even by contemporary artists. The most notable of these works include:&lt;ref&gt;For detailed lists of the appearance of Elagabalus in various media, and a critical evaluation of some of these works, see Martijn Icks, ''The Crimes of Elagabalus: The Life and Legacy of Rome's Decadent Boy Emperor'' (London, 2012), 219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Severus Alexander''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Alexander's name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS SEVERVS ALEXANDER AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 October 208 – 19 March 235) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 222 to 235. Alexander was the last emperor of the [[Severan dynasty]]. He succeeded his cousin [[Elagabalus]] upon the latter's [[assassination]] in 222, and was ultimately assassinated himself, marking the [[epoch event]] for the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] — nearly fifty years of civil wars, foreign invasion, and collapse of the monetary economy.

Alexander was the [[heir apparent]] to his cousin, the eighteen-year-old Emperor who had been murdered along with his mother [[Julia Soaemias]] by his own guards, who, as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the [[Tiber river]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio, 60:20:2&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his cousin were both grandsons of the influential and powerful [[Julia Maesa]], who had arranged for Elagabalus' acclamation as emperor by the famous [[Legio III Gallica|Third Gallic Legion]]. It was the rumor of Alexander's death that triggered the assassination of Elagabalus and his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 5:8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

As emperor, Alexander's peace time reign was prosperous. However militarily Rome was confronted with the rising [[Sassanid Empire]]. He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids, but when campaigning against [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] of [[Germania]], Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. This alienated many in the [[Roman legion|legions]] and led to a conspiracy to assassinate and replace him.

==Domestic achievements==
[[Image:Severus alexander.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Denarius]]'' of Severus Alexander.]]
Under the influence of his mother, Alexander did much to improve the morals and condition of the people, and to enhance the dignity of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt; He employed noted [[jurist]]s to oversee the administration of justice, such as the famous jurist [[Ulpian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot; /&gt; His advisers were men like the [[Roman Senate|senator]] and historian [[Cassius Dio]] and it is claimed that he created a select board of sixteen senators,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 60&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; although this claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;from the chapter entitled Administrative Strategies of the Emperor Severus Alexander and his Advisers, written by Lukas de Blois in the book Herrschaftsstrukturen und Herrschaftspraxis, chapter by&lt;/ref&gt; He also created a municipal council of fourteen who assisted the [[urban prefect]] in administering the affairs of the fourteen districts of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 33:1&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 15:1&lt;/ref&gt; He also restored the [[Baths of Nero]] in 227 or 229 - they are sometimes also known as the Baths of Alexander after him.

Upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 46.5% to 43% — the actual silver weight dropping from 1.41&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.30&amp;nbsp;grams; however, in 229 he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity and weight to 45% and 1.46&amp;nbsp;grams respectively. The following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver – raising the silver purity and weight again to 50.5% and 1.50&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also during his reign taxes were lightened; literature, art and science were encouraged;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 21:6&lt;/ref&gt; and, for the convenience of the people, loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 21:2&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious matters, Alexander preserved an open mind.  It is said that he was desirous of erecting a temple to [[Jesus]], but was dissuaded by the [[Paganism|pagan]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 43:6–7&lt;/ref&gt;  He allowed a [[synagogue]] to be built in Rome, and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the [[Torah]] known as the [[Severus Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=1153 1901–1906 Jewish Encyclopedia article &quot;Alexander Severus&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal matters, Alexander did much to aid [[Military justice|the rights of his soldiers]]. He confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their [[Will and testament|will]], whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also confirmed that soldiers could free their slaves in their wills.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pg. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he protected the rights of soldiers to their property when they are off on campaign &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pg. 239&lt;/ref&gt; and reasserted that a soldier's property acquired in or because of military service (his ''castrense peculium'') could be claimed by no one else, not even the soldier's father.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pg. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian War==
On the whole, however, the reign of Alexander was prosperous until the rise, in the east, of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Ardashir I]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Severus Alexander.&quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 02 May. 2014. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/536782/Severus-Alexander&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the war that followed there are various accounts. According to [[Herodian]], the Roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats,&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:5–6:6&lt;/ref&gt; while according to the [[Historia Augusta]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 55:1–3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Alexander's own dispatch to the [[Roman Senate]], he gained great victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Making [[Antioch]] his base, he marched at the head of his troops towards [[Ctesiphon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; but a second army was destroyed by the Persians,&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:5:10&lt;/ref&gt; and further losses were incurred by the retreating Romans in [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:6:3&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, although the Sassanids were checked for the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; the conduct of the [[Imperial Roman army|Roman army]] showed an extraordinary lack of discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 232 there was a mutiny in the Syrian legion, who proclaimed [[Taurinus]] emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 24:2&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander managed to suppress the uprising, and Taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 59&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The emperor returned to [[Rome]] and celebrated a triumph in 233.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germanic War==

After the Persian war, Alexander returned to Antioch with the famous [[Origen]], one of the greatest Fathers of the Christian Church. Alexander's mother, Julia Mammaea, asked for him to tutor Alexander in [[Christianity]]. While Alexander was being educated in the Christian doctrines, the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. A new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after Alexander's success in the Persian war. In A.D 234, the barbarians crossed the Rhine and Danube in hordes that even caused panic at the gates of Rome. The soldiers serving under Alexander, who were already demoralized after their costly war against the Persians, were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

As word of the invasion spread, the Emperor took the front line and went to battle against the Germanic invaders. The Romans prepared heavily for the war against the Germanics, building a brigade of ships to carry the entire battalion across. However, at this point in Alexander's career, he still knew little about being a general. Because of this, he hoped the sole threat of his armies might be enough to persuade the Germanics to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Severus|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/alex-severus-index.html|publisher=Capitoline Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among the Germanic legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western Press Association&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Library of World History: Containing a Record of the Human Race from the Earliest Historical Period to the Present Time; Embracing a General Survey of the Progress of Mankind in National and Social Life, Civil Government, Religion, Literature, Science and Art, Volume 3|publisher=Western Press Association|location=New York Public Library|pages=1442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to incurring heavy losses against the Persians, and on the advice of his mother, Alexander attempted to buy the Germanic tribes off, so as to gain time.

It was this decision that resulted in the [[Legionary|legionaries]] looking down upon Alexander. They considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be Emperor. Under these circumstances  the army swiftly looked to replace Alexander. Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus was the next best option. He was a soldier from Thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western Press Association&quot;/&gt; He was also a man with superior personal strength, rising from peasantry to ultimately being the one chosen for the throne. With the Thracian's hailing came the end of the Severan Dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Saylor Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Severus Alexander (222–235 AD): The Calm before the Storm|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HIST301-7.2-SeverusAlexander-FINAL.pdf|publisher=The Saylor Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his own army growing with animosity and turning against him, the path for his assassination was paved.

== Death ==

Alexander was forced to face his German enemies in the early months of 235. By the time he and his mother arrived, the situation had settled, and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence, trying to bribe the German army to surrender was the more sensible course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg.61&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians, it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity. Pusillanimity was responsible for the revolt of Alexander’s army, resulting in Severus falling victim to the swords of his own men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valentine Nind Hopkins 240&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Valentine Nind Hopkins|first=Sir Richard|title=The Life of Alexander Severus|publisher=The University Press|location=Princeton University|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was following the nomination of Maximinus as emperor. Alexander was assassinated March 19, 235 together with his mother, in a mutiny of the [[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']] at [[Mainz|Moguntiacum (Mainz)]] while at a meeting with his generals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  These assassinations secured the throne for Maximinus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;&gt;Benario, ''Alexander Severus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aelius Lampridius|Lampridius]] documents two theories that elaborate on the assassination of Alexander Severus. The first claims that the disaffection of Mammaea was the main motive behind the homicide. However, Lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory where Alexander is murdered in Sicilia, located in Britain. In an open tent after his lunch, Alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops. They compared him to [[Elagabalus]], a divisive and unpopular Emperor whose own assassination paved the way for Alexander's reign. A German servant entered the tent and initiated the call for the Emperor’s assassination, an attack in which many of the troops joined. Alexander's attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the Emperor's assassination. Within minutes, Alexander was dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valentine Nind Hopkins 240&quot;/&gt; After Alexander's death, his economic policies were completely discarded and the Roman currency was devalued. This marked the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century, a time period in which the Roman empire came close to falling apart entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Saylor Foundation&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
Alexander was the last of the Syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt; His death signaled the end of the [[Severan dynasty]] and the beginning of the chaotic period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] which brought the empire to near collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for Roman Emperors. Though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during Alexander's time, emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 69&quot;&gt;Campbell, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Alexander's taking of his mother's advice not to get involved in battle, his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the Germanic threat, and the relative failure of his military campaign against the Persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 69&quot;&gt;Campbell, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Maximinus was able to overthrow Alexander by &quot;harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 69&quot;&gt;Campbell, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor, the legions paved the way for a half-century of widespread chaos and instability.

Alexander's reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 196&quot;&gt;Campbell, pg. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In 223 the [[Praetorian Guard]] murdered their [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]], Ulpian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 196&quot; /&gt; and did so in Alexander's presence and despite the emperor's pleas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot; /&gt; The soldiers then fought a three-day battle against the populace of Rome, and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 197&quot;&gt;Campbell, pg. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Dio also gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time, saying that they would rather just surrender to the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 197&quot; /&gt; Different reasons are given for this breakdown of military discipline: Campbell points to &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...the decline in the prestige of the Severan dynasty, the feeble nature of Alexander himself, who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mother's advice, and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 197&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Herodian, on the other hand, was convinced that &quot;the emperor's miserliness (partly the result of his mother's greed) and slowness to bestow donatives&quot; were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pg. 197&quot; /&gt;

According to Canduci, Alexander is remembered as an emperor who was &quot;level headed, well meaning, and conscientious,&quot; but his fatal flaw was his domination by his mother and grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot; /&gt; Not only did this undermine his authority, but his mother's influence was the cause of Alexander's least popular actions (convincing him not to take part in battle and trying to buy off the warring Germanic barbarians).

Although the emperor and his rule were declared  damned by the Senate at the news of his death and the ascension of a new emperor in his place, Alexander was [[Apotheosis|deified]] after the death of Maximinus in 238.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Severus Alexander.&quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 02 May. 2014 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/536782/Severus-Alexander&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Severus Alexander became emperor when he was 13 years old, making him the youngest Emperor in Rome's history until the ascension of Gordian III. His grandmother believed that he had more potential to rule than her other grandson, the increasingly unpopular then-emperor Elagabalus.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to preserve her own position, she had Elagabalus adopt the young Alexander and then arranged for his assassination, securing the throne for Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman army hailed Alexander emperor on March 13, 222, immediately instilling him with the titles of Augustus, pater patriae, and pontifex maximus. Throughout his life, Alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother, Maesa, and mother, Mamaea. Alexander's grandmother died in 223, leaving his mother as the sole influence upon Alexander's actions. As a young, immature, and inexperienced 13-year-old, Alexander knew little about government and the role of ruling over an empire. Because of this, throughout his entire reign he was a puppet of his mother's advice and entirely under her jurisdiction, a prospect that was not popular among the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was married three times. His most famous wife was [[Sallustia Orbiana]], ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]],'' whom he married in 225. Sallustia Orbiana was 16 years old when marrying Alexander Severus, as the result of an arranged marriage by Alexander's mother, Julia Mamaea. However, as soon as Orbiana received the title of ''Augusta,'' Mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of Alexander's wife due to her excessive desire of all regal female titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt;  He divorced and exiled her in 227, after her father, [[Seius Sallustius]], was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 59&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Another wife was Sulpicia Memmia, a member of one of the most ancient Patrician families in Rome. Her father was a man of consular rank; her grandfather's name was ''Catulus''.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 20:3&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of Alexander's third wife is unknown. Alexander fathered no children with all three wives.

Concerning religious matters, Alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel, and had the motto, &quot;Do unto others as thou wouldst have them do unto thee&quot; inscribed on his palace and upon various public buildings. He was extremely tolerant of not only Christians, but also [[Jews]], as he continued all privileges towards Jews during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Severus|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1153-alexander-severus|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also claimedly placed images of Abraham and Jesus in his oratory, along with other Roman deities and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Severus|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13743a.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maximinus Thrax''' ({{lang-la|Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Maximinus' name would be inscribed as GAIVS IVLIVS VERVS MAXIMINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;  c. 173&amp;nbsp;– May 238), also known as '''Maximinus I''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 235 to 238.

Maximinus is described by several ancient sources, though none are contemporary except [[Herodian]]'s ''Roman History''. He was a so-called [[barracks emperor]] of the 3rd century; his rule is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He died at [[Aquileia]] whilst attempting to put down a Senatorial revolt.

==Rise to power==
Most likely Maximinus  was of [[Thraco-Roman]] origin (believed so by Herodian in his writings).&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:1:1-2&lt;/ref&gt; According to the notoriously unreliable [[Augustan History]] (''Historia Augusta''), he was born in [[Thrace]] or [[Moesia]] to a [[Goths|Goth]]ic father and an [[Alans|Alan]]ic mother,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 1:5&lt;/ref&gt; an Iranian people of the Scythian-Sarmatian branch; however, the supposed parentage is highly unlikely, as the presence of the Goths in the [[Danubian]] area is first attested after the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century. British historian [[Ronald Syme]], writing that &quot;the word 'Gothia' should have sufficed for condemnation&quot; of the passage in the ''Augustan History'', felt that the burden of evidence from [[Herodian]], [[George Syncellus|Syncellus]] and elsewhere pointed to Maximinus having been born in [[Moesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pp. 182, 185–6&lt;/ref&gt;  The references to his &quot;Gothic&quot; ancestry might refer to a [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Getae]] origin (the two populations were often confused by later writers, most notably by [[Jordanes]] in his ''[[Getica]]''), as suggested by the paragraphs describing how &quot;he was singularly beloved by the Getae, moreover, as if he were one of themselves&quot; and how he spoke &quot;almost pure Thracian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 2:5&lt;/ref&gt;

His background was, in any case, that of a provincial of low birth, and was seen by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] as a barbarian, not even a true Roman, despite [[Caracalla]]’s edict granting citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways, Maximinus was similar to the later Thraco-Roman emperors of the 3rd-5th century ([[Licinius]], [[Galerius]], [[Aureolus]], [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo the Thracian]], etc.), elevating themselves, via a military career, from the condition of a common [[soldier]] in one of the [[Roman legions]] to the foremost positions of political power. He joined the army during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 168&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; but did not rise to a powerful position until promoted by [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximinus was in command of [[Legio IV Italica|Legio IV ''Italica'']], composed of recruits from [[Pannonia]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 8:6:1&lt;/ref&gt; who were angered by Alexander's payments to the [[Alemanni]] and his avoidance of war.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The troops, among whom included the [[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']], elected the stern Maximinus, killing young Alexander and his mother at ''Moguntiacum'' (modern [[Mainz]]).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Praetorian Guard]] acclaimed him emperor, and their choice was grudgingly confirmed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; who were displeased to have a peasant as emperor. His son [[Gaius Julius Verus Maximus|Maximus]] became ''[[caesar (title)#Minor dynastic title|caesar]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation of power===
Maximinus hated the nobility and was ruthless towards those he suspected of plotting against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  He began by eliminating the close advisors of Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Maximinus Thrax''&lt;/ref&gt; His suspicions may have been justified; two plots against Maximinus were foiled.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The first was during a campaign across the [[Rhine]], when a group of officers, supported by influential senators, plotted to destroy a bridge across the river, in order to strand Maximinus in hostile territory. &lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:1:5-6&lt;/ref&gt; They planned to elect senator [[Magnus (Roman usurper)|Magnus]] emperor, afterwards; but the conspiracy was discovered and the conspirators executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The second plot involved [[Mesopotamia]]n archers who were loyal to Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 11:1&lt;/ref&gt; They planned to elevate [[Quartinus]], but their leader Macedo changed sides and murdered Quartinus instead, although this was not enough to save his own life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence of frontiers===
The accession of Maximinus is commonly seen as the beginning of the ''[[Crisis of the Third Century]]'' (also known as the &quot;Military Anarchy&quot; or the &quot;Imperial Crisis&quot;), the commonly applied name for the crumbling and near collapse of the Roman Empire between 235 and 284 caused by three simultaneous crises: external invasion, internal civil war, and economic collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximinus' first campaign was against the [[Alamanni]], whom Maximinus defeated despite heavy Roman casualties in a swamp in the [[Agri Decumates]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:2:7&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory, Maximinus took the title ''Germanicus Maximus'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; raised his son Maximus to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|caesar]] and [[princeps iuventutis]], and deified his late wife Paulina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt; Maximinus may have launched a second campaign deep into Germania, defeating a Germanic tribe beyond the [[Weser]] in the [[Battle at the Harzhorn]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta, The Two Maximini''. 12:1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:2:3&lt;/ref&gt; Securing the German frontier, at least for a while, Maximinus then set up a winter encampment at [[Sirmium]] in [[Pannonia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 64&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and from that supply base fought the [[Dacia]]ns and the [[Sarmatians]] during the winter of 235–236.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt;

===Gordian I and Gordian II===
{{Year of Six Emperors}}
Early in 238, in the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], a treasury official's extortions through false judgments in corrupt courts against some local landowners ignited a full-scale revolt in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The landowners armed their clients and their agricultural workers and entered Thysdrus (modern [[El Djem]]), where they murdered the offending official and his bodyguards&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:4:6&lt;/ref&gt; and proclaimed the aged governor of the province, Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus ([[Gordian I]]), and his son, [[Gordian II]], as co-emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate in Rome switched allegiance, gave both Gordian and Gordian II the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], and set about rousing the provinces in support of the pair.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:16&lt;/ref&gt; Maximinus, wintering at [[Sirmium]] immediately assembled his army and advanced on Rome, the Pannonian legions leading the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, in Africa, the revolt had not gone as planned. The province of Africa was bordered on the west by the province of [[Numidia]], whose governor, [[Capelianus]], nursed a long-standing grudge against the Gordians and controlled the only legionary unit ([[Legio III Augusta|III ''Augusta'']]) in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  He marched on Carthage and easily overwhelmed the local militias defending the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian II was killed in the fighting and, on hearing this, Gordian I hanged himself with his belt.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 19:2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pupienus, Balbinus, and Gordian III===
When the African revolt collapsed, the Senate found itself in great jeopardy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 67&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Having shown clear support for the Gordians, they could expect no clemency from Maximinus when he reached Rome. In this predicament, they determined to defy Maximinus and elected two of their number, [[Pupienus and Balbinus]], as co-emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt; When the Roman mob heard that the Senate had selected two men from the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class, men whom the ordinary people held in no great regard, they protested, showering the imperial cortège with sticks and stones.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:10:5&lt;/ref&gt; A faction in Rome preferred Gordian's grandson ([[Gordian III]]), and there was severe street fighting. The co-emperors had no option but to compromise, and, sending for the grandson of the elder Gordian they appointed him ''Caesar''.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat and death===
Maximinus marched on Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1:12&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Aquileia]] closed its gates against him. His troops became disaffected during [[Siege of Aquileia|the unexpected siege of the city]], during which they suffered from famine and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In May 238, soldiers of the [[Legio II Parthica|II ''Parthica'']] in his camp assassinated him, his son, and his chief ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 67&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Their heads were cut off, placed on poles, and carried to Rome by cavalrymen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt;

Pupienus and Balbinus then became undisputed co-emperors.

==Politics==
Maximinus doubled the pay of soldiers;&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 168&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; this act, along with virtually continuous warfare, required higher taxes. Tax-collectors began to resort to violent methods and illegal confiscations, further alienating the governing class from everyone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Maximinus Thrax&quot;/&gt;

According to early church historian [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], the Imperial household of Maximinus' predecessor, Alexander, had contained many [[Christian]]s. Eusebius states that, hating his predecessor's household, Maximinius ordered  that the leaders of the churches should be put to death.&lt;ref name=Eusebius&gt;{{cite web|last=Eusebius|title=Church History|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|work=Book 6, Chapter 28|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Papandrea|first=James L.|title=Reading the Early Church Fathers: From the Didache to Nicaea|date=January 23, 2012|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0809147519}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eusebius, this persecution of 235 sent [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and [[Pope Pontian]] into exile but other evidence suggests that the persecutions of 235 were local to the provinces where they occurred rather than happening under the direction of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Clark, &quot;Third-Century Christianity&quot;, in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' 2nd ed., volume 12: ''The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193–337'', ed. Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, and Averil Cameron (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p.623.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ancient sources, ranging from the unreliable ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' to [[Herodian]], speak of Maximinus as a man of significantly greater size than his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 2:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; He is, moreover, depicted in ancient imagery as a man with a prominent brow, nose, and jaw; symptoms of [[acromegaly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold L. Klawans|Klawans, Harold L]]. ''The Medicine of History from Paracelsus to Freud'', Raven Press, 1982, New York, 3–15&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thumb]] was said to be so large that he wore his wife's [[bracelet]] as a ring for it. 

According to ''Historia Augusta'', &quot;he was of such size, so Cordus reports, that men said he was eight foot, six inches (c. 2.5 metres) in height&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Maximinus'', 6:8&lt;/ref&gt; It is very likely however that this is one of the many 'tall tales' in the ''Historia Augusta'', and is immediately suspect due to its citation of 'Cordus', one of the several fictitious authorities the work cites.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pp. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not going into the supposedly detailed portions of ''Historia Augusta'', the historian Herodian, a contemporary of Maximinus, mentions him as a man of greater size, noting that: &quot;He was in any case a man of such frightening appearance and colossal size that there is no obvious comparison to be drawn with any of the best-trained Greek athletes or warrior elite of the barbarians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:1:12&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians interpret the stories on Maximinus' unusual height (as well as other information on his appearance, like excessive sweating and superhuman strength) as popular stereotyped attributes which do no more than intentionally turn him into a stylized embodiment of the barbarian bandit&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Grünewald, transl. by John Drinkwater. ''Bandits in the Roman Empire:, Myth and Reality'', Routledge, 2004, p. 84. ISBN 0-415-32744-X&lt;/ref&gt; or emphasize the admiration and aversion that the image of the soldier evoked in the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Carrié in Andrea Giardina (ed.), transl. by Lydia G. Cochrane. ''The Romans'', University of Chicago Press, 1993, p. 116-117. ISBN 0-226-29050-6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Year of Six Emperors}}
'''Gordian I''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus Romanus Africanus}};&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/239047/Gordian-II&lt;/ref&gt; c. 159 – 12 April 238) was [[Roman Emperor]] for one month with his son [[Gordian II]] in 238, the [[Year of the Six Emperors]]. Caught up in a rebellion against the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], he was defeated by forces loyal to Maximinus before committing suicide.

==Early life==
Little is known on the early life and family background of Gordian. There is no reliable evidence on his family origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt; His family were of [[Equestrian order|Equestrian]] rank, who were modest and very wealthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian was said to be related to prominent senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; His praenomen and nomen ''Marcus Antonius'' suggest that his paternal ancestors received Roman citizenship under the [[Triumvir]] [[Mark Antony]], or one of his daughters, during the late [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian’s cognomen ‘Gordianus’ suggests that his family origins were from [[Anatolia]], especially [[Galatia]] and [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peuch, Bernadette, &quot;Orateurs et sophistes grecs dans les inscriptions d'époque impériale&quot;, (2002), pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Augustan History]], his mother was a Roman woman called Ulpia Gordiana and his father Roman Senator Maecius Marullus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia Augusta, The Three Gordians, 2:2&quot;/&gt; While modern historians have dismissed his father's name as false, there may be some truth behind the identity of his mother. Gordian's family history can be guessed through inscriptions. The name ''Sempronianus'' in his name may indicate a connection to his mother or grandmother. In [[Ankara]] [[Turkey]], a funeral inscription has been found that names a ''Sempronia Romana'', daughter of a named ''Sempronius Aquila'' (an imperial secretary).&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  Romana erected this undated funeral inscription to her husband (whose name is lost) who died as a [[praetor]]-designate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian might have been related to the gens [[Sempronia (gens)|Sempronia]].

French historian [[Christian Settipani]] gives as his parents Marcus Antonius (b. ca 135), ''tr. pl.'', ''praet. des.'', and wife Sempronia Romana (b. ca 140), daughter of Titus Flavius Sempronius Aquila (b. ca 115), ''Secretarius ab epistulis Graecis'', and wife Claudia (b. ca 120), daughter of an unknown father and wife [[Claudia Tisamenis]] (b. ca 100), sister of [[Herodes Atticus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; It seems therefore that the person who was related to Herodes Atticus was Gordian I's mother or grandmother and not his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt;
Also according to the Augustan History, his wife was a Roman woman called [[Fabia Orestilla]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia Augusta, The Three Gordians, 17:4&quot;/&gt; born circa 165, whom the Augustan History claims was a descendant of Roman Emperors [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]] through her father Fulvus Antoninus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia Augusta, The Three Gordians, 17:4&quot;/&gt;  Modern historians have dismissed this name and her information as false.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt;

With his wife, Gordian had at least two children: a son of the same name ([[Gordian II]])&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 17:1&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, [[Antonia Gordiana]] (who was the mother of the future Emperor [[Gordian III]]).&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 4:2&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife died before 238. [[Christian Settipani]] gives as her parents Marcus Annius Severus, who was a Suffect [[Roman consul|Consul]], and wife Silvana, born circa 140, daughter of [[Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus]] and wife Aurelia Fadilla, daughter of [[Antoninus Pius]] and wife Annia Galeria Faustina or [[Faustina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Gordian climbed the hierarchy until he entered the [[Roman Senate]]. His political career started relatively late in his life&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt; and probably his early years were spent in rhetoric and literary studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; As a military man, Gordian commanded the [[Legio IIII Scythica]] when the legion was stationed in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; He served as governor of [[Roman Britain]] in 216 and was a Suffect [[Roman consul|Consul]] sometime during the reign of [[Elagabalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt;  Inscriptions in Roman Britain bearing his name were partially erased suggesting some form of imperial displeasure during this role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 339&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

While he gained unbounded popularity by the magnificent games and shows he produced as [[aedile]],&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 3:5&lt;/ref&gt; his prudent and retired life did not excite the suspicion of [[Caracalla]], in whose honour he wrote a long epic poem called ''Antoninias''.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian certainly retained his wealth and political clout during the chaotic times of the Severan dynasty, which suggest his personal dislike for intrigue. [[Philostratus]] dedicated his work ''Lives of the Sophists'' to either him or his son, [[Gordian II]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Grant, The Roman Emporers&quot;, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
During the reign of [[Alexander Severus]], Gordian (who was by then in his late sixties), after serving his suffect consulship prior to 223, drew lots for the [[proconsul]]ar governorship of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:5:2&lt;/ref&gt; which he assumed in 237.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 333&lt;/ref&gt;  However, prior to the commencement of his [[promagistrate|promagistrature]], [[Maximinus Thrax]] killed Emperor Alexander Severus at [[Mainz|Moguntiacum]] in [[Germania Inferior]] and assumed the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sestertius Gordian I-s2385.jpg|left|thumb|Gordian I on a coin, bearing the title AFR, ''Africanus''.]]
Maximinus was not a popular emperor and universal discontent roused by his oppressive rule culminated in a revolt in Africa in 238.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The trigger was the actions of Maximinus’s [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] in Africa, who sought to extract the maximum level of taxation and fines possible, including falsifying charges against the local aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; A riot saw the death of the procurator, after which they turned to Gordian and demanded that he accept the dangerous honor of the imperial throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 66&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian, after protesting that he was too old for the position, eventually yielded to the popular clamour and assumed both the purple and the ''[[Roman naming conventions|cognomen]]'' '''Africanus''' on March 22.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:5:8&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Edward Gibbon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of [Africa], the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony. (…) A respite of three days, obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer, was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords, and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes. The leaders of the conspiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator, stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments, and, by the assistance of their tumultuary train, seized on the little town of Thysdrus, and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman empire. (...)  Gordianus, their proconsul, and the object of their choice [as emperor], refused, with unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honour, and begged with tears that they should suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life, without staining his feeble age with civil blood. Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple, his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of Maximin (...).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. I, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to his advanced age, he insisted that his son, Marcus Antonius Gordianus ([[Gordian II]]), be associated with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 66&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Gordian entered the city of [[Carthage]] with the overwhelming support of the population and local political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:6:2&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile in Rome, Maximinus' [[Praetorian Guard|praetorian prefect]] was assassinated and the rebellion seemed to be successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 169&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Gordian in the meantime had sent an embassy to Rome, under the leadership of [[Valerian (emperor)|Publius Licinius Valerianus]],&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1:11&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain the Senate’s support for his rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 169&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The senate confirmed the new emperor on 2 April and many of the provinces gladly sided with Gordian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition would come from the neighbouring province of [[Numidia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 67&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Capelianus, governor of Numidia, loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax, and who held a grudge against Gordian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt; renewed his alliance to the former emperor and invaded Africa province with the only legion stationed in the region, [[Legio III Augusta|III ''Augusta'']], and other veteran units.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:9:3&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian II, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers, lost the [[Battle of Carthage (238)|Battle of Carthage]] and was killed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and Gordian took his own life by hanging himself with his belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gordians had reigned only thirty-six days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian I&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian I''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Gordian had deserved his high reputation by his amiable character. Both he and his son were men reported to be fond of literature and achieved great accomplishments, publishing voluminous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  But they were more interested in intellectual pursuits, possessing neither the necessary skills nor the resources to be considered able statesmen or powerful rulers. Having embraced the cause of Gordian, the senate was obliged to continue the revolt against Maximinus, and appointed [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]], as joint emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 67&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, by the end of 238, the recognised emperor would be [[Gordian III]], his grandson.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian and his son were [[Apotheosis#Roman|deified]] by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 16:4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordian II''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus Romanus Africanus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Gordian's name would be inscribed as MARCVS ANTONIVS GORDIANVS SEMPRONIANVS ROMANVS AFRICANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 192 – April 12, 238), was [[Roman Emperor]] for one month with his father [[Gordian I]] in 238, the [[Year of the Six Emperors]]. Seeking to overthrow the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], he died in battle outside of [[Carthage]].

==Early life==
Born c. 192, Gordian II was the only known son of [[Gordian I|Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus the Elder]]. His family were of [[Equestrian order|Equestrian]] rank, who were modest and very wealthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Gordian was said to be related to prominent senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; His praenomen and nomen ''Marcus Antonius'' suggest that his paternal ancestors received Roman citizenship under the Triumvir [[Mark Antony]], or one of his daughters, during the late [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, pg. 340&quot;&gt;Birley, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordian’s cognomen ‘Gordianus’ suggests that his family origins were from [[Anatolia]], especially [[Galatia]] and [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peuch, Bernadette, &quot;Orateurs et sophistes grecs dans les inscriptions d'époque impériale&quot;, (2002), pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the notoriously unreliable [[Historia Augusta]], his mother was a Roman woman called [[Fabia Orestilla]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia Augusta, The Three Gordians, 17:4&quot;/&gt; born circa 165, who the Augustan History claims was a descendant of Roman Emperors [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]] through her father Fulvus Antoninus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia Augusta, The Three Gordians, 17:4&quot;/&gt; Modern historians have dismissed this name and her information as false.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pp.100-101&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence to suggest that Gordian's mother may have been the granddaughter of Greek Sophist, consul and tutor [[Herodes Atticus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian II&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian II''&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister was [[Antonia Gordiana]], who was the mother of Emperor [[Gordian III]].

Although the memory of the Gordians would have been cherished by the Senate and thus appear sympathetic in any Senatorial documentation of the period, the only account of Gordian's early career that has survived is contained within the Historia Augusta, and it cannot be taken as an accurate or reliable description of his life story prior to his elevation to the purple in 238.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pp. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; According to this source, Gordian served as [[quaestor]] in [[Elagabalus]]' reign&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 18:4&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[praetor]] and [[consul|consul suffect]] with Emperor [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 18:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 341. An inscription confirming this fact has been found at [[Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 237, Gordian went to the [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]] as a [[legatus]] under his father's command as a [[proconsul]]ar governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolt against Maximinus Thrax==
Early in 235, Emperor Alexander Severus and his mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] were assassinated by mutinous troops at [[Mainz|Moguntiacum]] in [[Germania Inferior]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the rebellion, [[Maximinus Thrax]], became Emperor, despite his low-born background and the disapproval of the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted by a local elite that had just killed Maximinus's [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 66&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Gordian's father was forced to participate in a full-scale revolt against Maximinus in 238 and became [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] on March 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian II&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian II''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Gordian I's advanced age, the younger Gordian was attached to the imperial throne and acclaimed Augustus too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 66&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his father, he too was awarded the ''[[Roman naming conventions|cognomen]]'' '''Africanus'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian II&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian II''&lt;/ref&gt;

Father and son saw their claim to the throne ratified both by the Senate&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:7:2&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the other provinces, due to Maximinus' unpopularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition would come from the neighbouring province of [[Numidia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Capelianus]], governor of Numidia, a loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax, and who held a grudge against Gordian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 170&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt; renewed his allegiance to the reigning emperor&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt; and invaded Africa province with the only legion stationing in the region, [[Legio III Augusta|III ''Augusta'']], and other veteran units.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 7:9:3&lt;/ref&gt; Gordian II, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers, lost the [[Battle of Carthage (238)|Battle of Carthage]] and was killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian II&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian II''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Historia Augusta, his body was never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''The Three Gordians'', 16:1&lt;/ref&gt;  Hearing the news, his father took his own life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, Gordian II&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Gordian II''&lt;/ref&gt;  This first rebellion against Maximinus Thrax was unsuccessful but, by the end of 238, Gordian II's nephew would be recognised emperor by the whole Roman world as [[Gordian III]] .&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PupienusSest.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Sestertius]] of Pupienus.]]
'''Pupienus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Pupienus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS CLODIVS PVPIENVS MAXIMVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;  born c. 165/170&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant, ''The Roman emperors: a biographical guide to the rulers of imperial Rome, 31 BC-AD 476'' (1985), pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; – 29 July 238), also known as '''Pupienus Maximus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] with [[Balbinus]] for three months in 238, during the [[Year of the Six Emperors]]. The sources for this period are scant, and thus knowledge of the emperor is limited. In most contemporary texts Pupienus is referred by his [[agnomen]] &quot;Maximus&quot; rather than by his [[cognomen]] (family name) Pupienus.

==Origins and early career==
The ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', whose testimony is not to be trusted unreservedly, paints Pupienus as an example of advancement through the [[cursus honorum]] due to military success. It claims he was the son of a [[blacksmith]], was adopted by one Pescennia Marcellina (otherwise unknown), and who started his career as a ''[[Centurion|Centurio]]'' ''[[primus pilus]]'' before becoming a [[Tribunus Militum]], and then a [[Praetor]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Maximus and Balbinus'', 5:1-8&lt;/ref&gt; He was in fact part of the aristocracy, albeit a minor one, and possibly quite recently.&lt;ref&gt;John Drinkwater, ''Maximinus to Diocletian and the crisis'', in ''The Cambridge ancient history: The crisis of empire, A.D. 193-337'' (ed. Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Averil Cameron) (2005), pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Hailing from the [[Etruria|Etruscan]] city of [[Volterra]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Christol, ''L'empire romain du IIIe siècle: histoire politique'' (1997), pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; it has been speculated that Pupienus was the son of [[Marcus Pupienus Maximus]], a [[Roman Senate|Senator]] who was the first member of his family to enter the Senate, and wife Clodia Pulchra.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Settipani, ''Continuité gentilice et continuité familiale dans les familles sénatoriales romaines à l'époque impériale: mythe et réalité'' (2000), pg. 120 – Note that this speculation is based upon onomastic similarities and probabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

Pupienus’s career was impressive, serving a number of important posts during the reign of the [[Severan dynasty]] throughout the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. This included assignment as [[Proconsul]] of the senatorial [[propraetor]]ial [[Roman provinces|provinces]] of [[Bithynia et Pontus]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''&quot;&gt;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt; He was later assigned as [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|imperial legate]] to one of the [[Germania|German]] provinces, most probably after his first [[Roman consul|suffect consulship]], circa 207 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''&quot;/&gt; During his time as governor, he was quite popular and scored military victories over the [[Sarmatian]]s and German tribes.

In 234, during the last years of [[Severus Alexander]]’s reign, he was installed as Consul for the second time. In that same year he was also appointed [[Praefectus Urbi|Urban Prefect]] of Rome and gained a reputation for severity, to the extent that he became unpopular with the Roman mob.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: a military and political history'' (2004), pg. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
When  [[Gordian I]] and his [[Gordian II|son]] were proclaimed Emperors in Africa, the Senate appointed a committee of twenty men, including the elderly Senator Pupienus, to co-ordinate operations against Maximinus until the arrival of the Gordians.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt; On the news of the Gordians' defeat and deaths, however, the Senate met in closed session in the Temple of [[Jupiter Capitolinus]] and voted for two members of the committee to be installed as co-emperors – Pupienus and [[Balbinus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''&quot;/&gt; Unlike the situation in 161 with [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]], both emperors were elected as ''[[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices maximi]]'', chief priests of the official cults. 

According to Edward Gibbon (drawing on the narratives of Herodian and the ''Historia Augusta''), the choice was sensible, as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the mind of Maximus [Pupienus] was formed in a rougher mould [than that of Balbinus]. By his valour and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments of the state and army. His victories over the Sarmatians and the Germans, the austerity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of his justice whilst he was prefect of the city, commanded the esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Balbinus. The two colleagues had both been consul... and, since the one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', vol. I, p. 225, Edward Gibbon (The Online Library of Liberty). [http://oll.libertyfund.org/files/1365/Gibbon_0214.01.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, factions within the Senate who had hoped to profit from the accession of the Gordians manipulated the people and the [[Praetorian Guard]] to agitate for the elevation of [[Gordian III]] as their imperial colleague.&lt;ref&gt;John Drinkwater, ''Maximinus to Diocletian and the crisis'', in ''The Cambridge ancient history: The crisis of empire, A.D. 193-337'' (ed. Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Averil Cameron) (2005), pgs. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving his senior colleague Balbinus in charge of the civil administration at Rome, sometime during late April Pupienus marched to [[Ravenna]], where he oversaw the campaign against Maximinus, recruiting German auxiliary troops who had served under him whilst he was in Germania;&lt;ref name=&quot;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''&quot;/&gt; after the latter was [[Siege of Aquileia|assassinated by his soldiers just outside Aquileia]] he despatched both Maximinus's troops and his own back to their provinces (along with a considerable donative) and returned to Rome with his newly acquired German bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''; Southern, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Balbinus, in the meantime, had failed to keep public order in the capital. The sources suggest that Balbinus suspected Pupienus of using his newly acquired German bodyguard to supplant him, and they were soon living in different parts of the Imperial palace.,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 171; Canduci, pgs. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that they were at the mercy of disaffected elements in the Praetorians, who resented serving under Senate-appointed emperors, and now plotted to kill them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant, ''The collapse and recovery of the Roman Empire'' (1999), pgs. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Pupienus, becoming aware of the threat, begged Balbinus to call for the German bodyguard. Balbinus, believing that this news was part of a plot by Pupienus to have him assassinated, refused, and the two began to argue just as the Praetorians burst into the room. Both emperors were seized and dragged back to the Praetorian barracks where they were tortured and brutally hacked to death.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''; Canduci, pgs. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Pupienus had at least three children. His eldest son, [[Tiberius Clodius Pupienus Pulcher Maximus]], was a Consul Suffectus c. 235, and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] of the town of [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]] outside Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, ''Historia Augusta papers'' (1983), pg. 194&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest son, [[Marcus Pupienus Africanus Maximus]], was Consul Ordinarius in 236 as colleague of the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]]. This run of consulships in the family, across the reigns of Severus Alexander and Maximinus Thrax, show that the family was influential and in high favour. Pupienus also had a daughter, named Pupiena Sextia Paulina Cethegilla, wife of [[Marcus Ulpius Eubiotus Leurus]].

[[File:BalbinusSest.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Sestertius]] of Balbinus.]]
'''Balbinus''' ({{lang-la|Decimus Caelius Calvinus Balbinus Pius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Balbinus' name would be inscribed as DECIMVS CAELIVS BALBINVS PIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adkins, Lesley|author2=Adkins, Roy A.|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1994|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; c. 178 – 29 July 238), was [[Roman Emperor]] with [[Pupienus]] for three months in 238, the [[Year of the Six Emperors]].

== Origins and career ==
Not much is known about Balbinus before his elevation to emperor. It has been conjectured that he descended from Publius Coelius Balbinus Vibullius Pius, the [[Roman consul|consul ordinarius]] of 136 or 137, and wife Aquilia. If this were true, he was also related to the family of [[Quintus Pompeius Falco|Q. Pompeius Falco]], which supplied many politicians of consular rank throughout the 3rd century, and to the 1st-century politician, engineer and author [[Sextus Julius Frontinus|Julius Frontinus]], as well as a descendant of a first cousin of [[Trajan]].{{cn|date=December 2013}} He was born around 178.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; He was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] from birth, and was the son (either by birth or adoption) of ... Caelius Calvinus, who was legate of [[Cappadocia]] in 184. He was one of the [[Salii]] priests of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Michael Grant, The Roman Emporers&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodian]] he had governed provinces, but the list of seven provinces given in the ''Historia Augusta'', as well as the statement that Balbinus had been both [[Proconsul]] of [[Asia]] and of [[Africa]], are likely to be mere invention.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He had certainly been twice consul; his first consulate is not certainly known but is believed to have been about 203 or in July 211; he was consul for the second time in 213 as colleague of [[Caracalla]], which suggests he enjoyed that emperor's favour.

== Reign ==
According to Edward Gibbon (drawing upon the narratives of Herodian and the ''Historia Augusta''): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Balbinus was an admired orator, a poet of distinguished fame, and a wise magistrate, who had exercised with innocence and applause the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of the empire. His birth was noble, his fortune affluent, his manners liberal and affable. In him, the love of pleasure was corrected by a sense of dignity, nor had the habits of ease deprived him of a capacity for business.  (...)  The two colleagues [Pupienus and Balbinus] had both been consul (Balbinus had twice enjoyed that honourable office), both had been named among the twenty lieutenants  of the senate; and, since the one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', vol. I, p. 225, Edward Gibbon (The Online Library of Liberty). [http://oll.libertyfund.org/files/1365/Gibbon_0214.01.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the [[Gordian I|Gordians]] were proclaimed Emperors in Africa, the Senate appointed a committee of twenty men, including Balbinus, to co-ordinate operations against [[Maximinus Thrax]].{{cn|date=December 2013}} On the news of the Gordians' defeat, the Senate voted Pupienus and Balbinus as co-emperors on 22 April 238,&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; though they were soon forced to co-opt the child [[Gordian III]] as a colleague. Unlike the situation in 161, both emperors were elected as ''[[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices maximi]]'', chief priests of the official cults. This would be unthinkable in Republican times. Balbinus was probably in his early seventies: his qualifications for rule are unknown, except presumably that he was a senior senator, rich and well-connected. While Pupienus marched to [[Ravenna]], where he oversaw [[Siege of Aquileia|the campaign against Maximinus]], Balbinus remained in Rome, but failed to keep public order. The sources suggest that after Pupienus's victorious return following Maximinus' death, Balbinus suspected Pupienus of wanting to supplant him, and they were soon living in different parts of the Imperial palace,{{cn|date=December 2013}} where they were later assassinated by disaffected elements of the [[Praetorian Guard]], with Balbinus' death occurring on 29 July 238.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

== Sarcophagus ==
The 'sarcophagus of Balbinus' has earned this Emperor a niche in the history of Roman Imperial art. Presumably while holding the title of Emperor, Balbinus had a marble [[sarcophagus]] made for himself and his wife (whose name is unknown). Discovered in fragments near the [[Via Appia]] and restored, this is the only example of a Roman Imperial sarcophagus of this type to have survived. On the lid are reclining figures of Balbinus and his wife, the figure of the Emperor also being a fine portrait of him. The sarcophagus is held in collection at the ''Museo di Pretastato'' (at the catacombs of [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus|Praetextatus]]) in the [[Park of the Caffarella]] near the [[Appian Way]] at Rome. 

Although in accounts of their joint reign Balbinus is emphasized as the civilian as against Pupienus the military man, on the side of the sarcophagus he is portrayed in full military dress.

'''Gordian III''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Antonius Gordianus Pius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Gordian's name would be inscribed as MARCVS ANTONIVS GORDIANVS PIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;  20 January 225 AD – 11 February 244 AD), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 238 AD to 244 AD. At the age of 13, he became the youngest sole legal Roman emperor throughout the existence of the united [[Roman Empire]]. Gordian was the son of [[Antonia Gordiana]] and an unnamed Roman Senator who died before 238. Antonia Gordiana was the daughter of Emperor [[Gordian I]] and younger sister of Emperor [[Gordian II]]. Very little is known on his early life before his acclamation. Gordian had assumed the name of his maternal grandfather in 238 AD.

==Rise to power==
[[File:Gordian III Antoninianus.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Antoninianus]] of Gordian III]]In 235, following the murder of Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] in Moguntiacum (modern [[Mainz]]), the capital of the [[Roman province]] [[Germania Inferior]], [[Maximinus Thrax]] was acclaimed Emperor. In the following years, there was a growing opposition against Maximinus in the [[Roman senate]] and amongst the majority of the population of Rome. In 238 a rebellion broke out in the [[Africa Province]], where Gordian's grandfather and uncle, Gordian I and II, were proclaimed joint emperors. This revolt was suppressed within a month by Cappellianus, governor of [[Numidia]] and a loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax. The elder Gordians died, but public opinion cherished their memory as peace-loving and literate men, victims of Maximinus' oppression. 

Meanwhile, Maximinus was on the verge of marching on Rome and the Senate elected [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]] as joint emperors. These senators were not popular men and the population of Rome was still shocked by the elder Gordian's fate, so that the Senate decided to take the teenager Gordian, rename him Marcus Antonius Gordianus as his grandfather, and raise him to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|''Caesar'']] and imperial heir. [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]] defeated Maximinus, mainly due to the defection of several [[Roman legion|legions]], particularly the [[Legio II Parthica|II ''Parthica'']] who assassinated Maximinus. But their joint reign was doomed from the start with popular riots, military discontent and an enormous fire that consumed Rome in June 238. On July 29, Pupienus and Balbinus were killed by the [[Praetorian Guard]] and  Gordian proclaimed sole emperor.

==Rule==
Due to Gordian's age, the imperial government was surrendered to the aristocratic families, who controlled the affairs of Rome through the Senate. In 240, [[Sabinianus]] revolted in the African province, but the situation was quickly brought under control. In 241, Gordian was married to Furia Sabinia [[Tranquillina]], daughter of the newly appointed praetorian prefect, [[Gaius Furius Sabinius Aquila Timesitheus|Timesitheus]]. As chief of the Praetorian Guard and father in law of the Emperor, Timesitheus quickly became the ''de facto'' ruler of the Roman Empire. 

In the 3rd century, the Roman frontiers weakened against the Germanic tribes across the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]], and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Empire across the [[Euphrates]] increased its own attacks. When the Persians under [[Shapur I]] invaded [[Mesopotamia]], the young emperor opened the doors of the [[Temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|Temple of Janus]] for the last time in Roman history, and sent a large army to the East. The Sassanids were driven back over the Euphrates and defeated in the [[Battle of Resaena]] (243).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker147&quot;&gt;''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was a success and Gordian, who had joined the army, was planning an invasion of the enemy's territory, when his father-in-law died in unclear circumstances. Without Timesitheus, the campaign, and the Emperor's security, were at risk.
{{Year of Six Emperors}} 
[[Gaius Julius Priscus]] and, later on, his own brother Marcus Julius Philippus, also known as [[Philip the Arab]], stepped in at this moment as the new Praetorian Prefects&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; and the campaign proceeded. Around February 244, the Persians fought back fiercely to halt the  Roman advance to Ctesiphon. Persian sources claim that a battle occurred ([[Battle of Misiche]]) near modern [[Fallujah]] ([[Iraq]]) and resulted in a major Roman defeat and the death of Gordian III.&lt;ref&gt;''Res Gestae Divi Saporis'', 3–4 (translation of Shapur's inscription at Naqsh-i Rustam)&lt;/ref&gt; Roman sources do not mention this battle and suggest that Gordian died far away from Misiche, at Zaitha ([[Dura-Europos|Qalat es Salihiyah]]) in northern Mesopotamia. Modern scholarship is not unanimously accepting this course of the events. One view holds that Gordian died at Zaitha, murdered by his frustrated army, while the role of Philip is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, pp.234,236.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Kettenhofen, Hartman and Winter have concluded that Gordian died in battle.
          
Philip transferred the body of the deceased emperor to Rome and arranged for his deiﬁcation.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordian's youth and good nature, along with the deaths of his grandfather and uncle and his own tragic fate at the hands of the enemy, earned him the lasting esteem of the Romans. The soldiers held Gordian in high esteem, as he may have sacrificed his life to save them in 244{{Unsourced-inline|date = March 2015}}.

'''Marcus Julius Philippus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Iulius Philippus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Philip's name would be inscribed as MARCVS IVLIVS PHILIPPVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa}} 204 – 249) also known commonly by his nickname '''Philip the Arab''' ({{lang-la|Philippus Arabs}}, {{lang-ar|فيليب العربي}}), also known as '''Philip''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 244 to 249. He was born in present-day [[Syria]] to a Syrian father, and went on to become a major figure in the Roman Empire. He achieved power after the death of [[Gordian III]], quickly negotiating peace with the [[Sassanid Empire]]. During his reign, Rome celebrated its millennium.

Among early [[Christian]] writers, Philip had the reputation of being sympathetic to the Christian faith. Probably for this reason it was even claimed by some that he had converted to [[Christianity]], which would have made him the first Christian emperor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} He supposedly tried to celebrate [[Easter]] with Christians in [[Antioch]], but the bishop Saint [[Babylas]] made him stand with the penitents.&lt;ref&gt;according to John Chrysostom&lt;/ref&gt; Philip and his wife received letters from [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;according to Eusebius.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip was overthrown and killed following a rebellion led by his successor [[Decius]].

==Early life==
Little is known about Philip's early life and political career. He was born in what is today [[Shahba]], about {{convert|55|mi|km}} southeast of [[Damascus]], in the [[Trachonitis]] district.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 36&quot;/&gt; At the time this was in the [[Roman province]] of [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, Glen W., ''Roman Arabia'', Harvard University Press, 1994, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; earning Philip the nickname &quot;the Arab&quot;. He was the son of a local citizen, [[Julius Marinus]], possibly of some importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;&gt;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&lt;/ref&gt;

While the name of Philip's mother is unknown, he did have a brother, [[Gaius Julius Priscus]], a member of the [[Praetorian Guard]] under [[Gordian III]] (238–244).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 232&lt;/ref&gt;  In 234, Philip married [[Marcia Otacilia Severa]], daughter of a Roman Governor. They had three children, a son named Marcus Julius Philippus Severus ([[Philippus II]]), born in 238,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt; a daughter called Julia Severa or Severina who is known from numismatic evidence but is never mentioned by the ancient Roman sources and a son named Quintus Philippus Severus, born in 247.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Accession to the throne==
[[Image:Otacilia Severa-l4Scythica.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Coin of Marcia Otacilia Severa, wife of Philip. The Greek legend states she received the title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]''.]]
[[Image:Relief of Shapur I capturing Valerian.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rock-face relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] of [[Shapur I]] (on horseback) with Philip the Arab and [[Emperor Valerian]] kneeling in surrender to the Persian king.]]
Philip’s rise to prominence began through the intervention of his brother Priscus, who was an important official under the emperor [[Gordian III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;  His big break came in 243, during Gordian III's campaign against [[Shapur I]] of Persia, when the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Gaius Furius Sabinius Aquila Timesitheus|Timesitheus]] died under unclear circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  At the suggestion of his brother Priscus, Philip became the new Praetorian prefect, with the intention that the two brothers would control the young Emperor and rule the Roman world as unofficial regents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;  Following a military defeat, Gordian III died in 244 under circumstances that are still debated. While some claim that Philip conspired in his murder, other accounts (including one coming from the Persian point of view) state that Gordian died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 70; Bowman, pg. 36; Potter, pg. 234; Canduci, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever the case, Philip assumed the purple robe following Gordian's death. According to [[Edward Gibbon]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His rise from so obscure a station to the first dignities of the empire seems to prove that he was a bold and able leader. But his boldness prompted him to aspire to the throne, and his abilities were employed to supplant, not to serve, his indulgent master.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', vol. I, p. 234, Edward Gibbon (The Online Library of Liberty). [http://oll.libertyfund.org/files/1365/Gibbon_0214.01.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philip was not willing to repeat the mistakes of previous claimants, and was aware that he had to return to [[Rome]] in order to secure his position with the [[Roman senate|senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 36&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his first priority was to conclude a peace treaty with Shapur I of Persia, and withdraw the army from a potentially disastrous situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 36; Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Philip was accused of abandoning territory, the actual terms of the peace were not as humiliating as they could have been.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 71&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip apparently retained Timesitheus’ reconquest of [[Osroene]] and [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], but he had to agree that [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] lay within Persia’s sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had to pay an enormous indemnity to the Persians of 500,000 gold denarii.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 237; Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip immediately issued coins proclaiming that he had made peace with the Persians (''pax fundata cum Persis'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 71&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading his army back up the [[Euphrates]], south of [[Circesium]] Philip erected a [[cenotaph]] in honor of Gordian III, but his ashes were sent ahead to [[Rome]], where he arranged for Gordian III’s deification.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 36; Potter, pg. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst in [[Antioch]], he left his brother Priscus as extraordinary ruler of the Eastern provinces, with the title of ''rector Orientis''&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 36; Southern, pg. 71; Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving westward, he gave his brother-in-law Severianus control of the provinces of [[Moesia]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually arrived in Rome in the late summer of 244, where he was confirmed [[Augustus (honorific)|''Augustus'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 36&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the end of the year, he nominated his young son ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and heir, his wife, Otacilia Severa, was named Augusta, and he also deified his father Marinus, even though he had never been Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 71&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Rome he also claimed an official victory over the Persians with the titles of ''Parthicus Adiabenicus'', ''Persicus Maximus'' and ''Parthicus Maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[Image:Antoninianus Philip - Philip.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cippus commemorating Roman Millennium.]]
In an attempt to shore up his regime, Philip put a great deal of effort in maintaining good relations with the Senate, and from the beginning of his reign, he reaffirmed the old Roman virtues and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 71&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly ordered an enormous building program in his home town, renaming it Philippopolis, and raising it to civic status, while he populated it with statues of himself and his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 238&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 238&lt;/ref&gt; This creation of a new city, piled on top of the massive tribute owed to the Persians, as well as the necessary donative to the army to secure its acceptance of his accession, meant Philip was desperately short of money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 238&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 238&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for it, he ruthlessly increased levels of taxation, while at the same time he ceased paying subsidies to the tribes north of the [[Danube]] that were vital for keeping the peace on the frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pgs. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt;  Both decisions would have significant impacts upon the empire and his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 240&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===At the Limes===
In 245, Philip was forced to leave Rome as the stability established by Timesitheus was undone by a combination of his death, Gordian’s defeat in the east and Philip’s decision to cease paying the subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 36; Potter, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] moved through [[Dacia]], crossed the [[Danube]] and emerged in [[Moesia]] where they threatened the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pgs. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing his headquarters in [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] in [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thrace]], he pushed the Carpi across the Danube and chased them back into Dacia, so that by the summer of 246, he claimed victory against them, along with the title &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 37; Southern, pgs 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arsacids of Armenia]] refused to acknowledge the authority of the Persian king Shapur I, and war with Persia flared up again by 245.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 240&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludi Saeculares===
Nevertheless, Philip was back in Rome by August 247, where he poured more money into the most momentous event of his reign – the [[Ludi Saeculares]], which coincided with the one thousandth anniversary of the foundation of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 37&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  So in April 248 AD (April 1000 [[Ab urbe condita|A.U.C.]]), Philip had the honor of leading the celebrations of the one thousandth birthday of Rome, which according to tradition was [[founding of Rome|founded]] on April 21, 753 BC by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. According to contemporary accounts, the festivities were magnificent and included spectacular games, [[Secular games|ludi saeculares]], and theatrical presentations throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Colosseum]], in what had been originally prepared for Gordian III’s planned [[Roman triumph]] over the Persians,&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 67; [[Martial]]; Coleman, Kathleen M., ''M. Valerii Martialis Liber Spectaculorum'' (2006), pg. lvi&lt;/ref&gt; more than 1,000 [[gladiator]]s were killed along with hundreds of exotic animals including hippos, leopards, lions, giraffes, and one rhinoceros.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, T. (Writer and Director). (2000). The Fall [Television series episode]. In T. Graham (Producer), Rome: Power and Glory. Military Channel.&lt;/ref&gt; The events were also celebrated in literature, with several publications, including [[Asinius Quadratus]]'s ''History of a Thousand Years'', specially prepared for the anniversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;  At the same time, Philip elevated his son to the rank of co-Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;

==Downfall==
Despite the festive atmosphere, there were continued problems in the provinces. In late 248, the legions of [[Pannonia]] and Moesia, dissatisfied with the result of the war against the Carpi, rebelled and proclaimed [[Pacatianus|Tiberius Claudius Pacatianus]] emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''; Canduci, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion that this entailed tempted the [[Quadi]] and other [[Germanic tribes]] to cross the frontier and raid [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 37&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Goths]] invaded [[Moesia]] and Thrace across the [[Danube]] frontier, and laid siege to [[Marcianopolis]],&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt; as the Carpi, encouraged by the Gothic incursions, renewed their assaults in Dacia and Moesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 37&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the East, [[Jotapianus|Marcus Jotapianus]] led another uprising in response to the oppressive rule of [[Gaius Julius Priscus|Priscus]] and the excessive taxation of the Eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''; Potter, pg. 239; Canduci, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other usurpers, [[Silbannacus|Marcus Silbannacus]] and [[Sponsianus]], are reported to have started rebellions without much success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;

Overwhelmed by the number of invasions and usurpers, Philip offered to resign, but the Senate decided to throw its support behind the Emperor, with a certain [[Decius|Gaius Messius Quintus Decius]] most vocal of all the senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 74&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip was so impressed by his support that he dispatched Decius to the region with a special command encompassing all of the Pannonian and Moesian provinces. This had a dual purpose of both quelling the rebellion of  Pacatianus as well as dealing with the barbarian incursions.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 74; Bowman, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[Image:Philipnote.jpg|thumb|right|300px|100 [[Syrian pound]] note with Philip the Arab.]]
Although Decius managed to quell the revolt, discontent in the legions was growing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 240&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Decius was proclaimed Emperor by the Danubian armies in the spring of 249 and immediately marched on Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 74; Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet even before he had left the region, the situation for Philip had turned even more sour. Financial difficulties had forced him to debase the [[Antoninianus]], as rioting began to occur in Egypt, causing disruptions to Rome’s wheat supply and further eroding Philip’s support in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Decius tried to come to terms with Philip,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 74&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Philip's army met the usurper near modern [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] that summer. Philip's army probably consisted of 2-3 Italian legions and the Praetorian Guard, bringing the numbers up to 20,000 men, while Decius' own forces consisted of 4-6 legions from the Danube region, as well as several cohorts of auxiliaries and contingents of cavalry, numbering a total of 30,000-40,000 soldiers. Decius easily won the battle and Philip was killed sometime in September 249,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 241; Bowman, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; either in the fighting or assassinated by his own soldiers who were eager to please the new ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meckler, ''Philip the Arab''&quot;/&gt;  Philip's eleven-year-old son and heir may have been killed with his father and Priscus disappeared without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
{{further|Philip the Arab and Christianity}}
Some later traditions, first mentioned in the historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', held that Philip was the first [[Christianity|Christian]] Roman Emperor. According to Eusebius (''Ecc. Hist.'' VI.34), Philip was a Christian, but was not allowed to enter Easter vigil services until he confessed his sins and ordered to sit among the penitents, which he did willingly. Later versions located this event in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/philarab.htm Philip the Arab and Rival Claimants of the later 240s]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, historians generally identify the later [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]], baptized on his deathbed, as the first Christian emperor, and generally describe Philip's adherence to Christianity as dubious, because non-Christian writers do not mention the fact, and because throughout his reign, Philip to all appearances (coinage, etc.) continued to follow the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cruse, C.F., translator. ''Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History'', Hendrickson Publishers, 1998 (fourth printing, 2004), pp. 220–221.
&lt;/ref&gt; Critics ascribe Eusebius' claim as probably due to the tolerance Philip showed towards Christians.  [[Quirinus of Tegernsee|Saint Quirinus of Rome]] was, according to a legendary account, the son of Philip the Arab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12615a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Sts.

'''Marcus F. Ru. Jotapianus''' (d. ''c.'' 249) or '''Jotapian''', he was also known as '''Iotapianus''' or '''Iotapian'''. Jotapianus was a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] in the eastern provinces of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]], around 249. Jotapianus is known from his rare coins and from accounts in [[Aurelius Victor]] (''Caesares'' xxix.2), [[Zosimus]] (i.20.2 and i.21.2), and [[Polemius Silvius]] (''[[Laterculus]]'').

== Life ==

===Origins===
Jotapianus was a member of the Near East indigenous aristocracy. His name is similar to those of Queen [[Julia Iotapa (daughter of Antiochus IV)|Julia Iotapa]] and her daughter, princess [[Julia Iotapa (Cilician Princess)|Julia Jotapa]] of the [[Kingdom of Commagene]], so he could have been a member of the Royal Family of Commagene, which had lost its power in favour of the Romans under Emperor [[Vespasian]] in 72.

Aurelius Victor reports that Jotapianus claimed descendance from an Alexander. According to some scholars, he referred to [[Alexander Severus]], while other scholars note that King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene]] claimed descendance from Greek King [[Alexander the Great]]. He could be a possible descendant of [[Gaius Julius Agrippa]] or his brother [[Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus]] or his sister [[Julia Iotapa (Cilician Princess)|Julia Iotapa]].

===Revolt and Death===
Jotapianus led a rebellion started in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], towards the end of Philip's rule, against the increase in taxation ordered by the ''rector Orientis'' [[Gaius Julius Priscus|Priscus]], Philip's brother. It is possible that Philip somehow favoured his Arabia over the other Eastern provinces, since his rule was not quietly accepted by the local population. Jotapianus made [[Antioch]] his capital, but the rebellion came to an end and Jotapianus was killed by his own soldiers, possibly during Emperor [[Decius (emperor)|Decius]]' rule.

===Coinage===
Coins issued by Jotapianus had been found. All of them are [[antoninianus|antoniniani]], all of them show a crude design, and all of them have a &lt;small&gt;VICTORIA AVG&lt;/small&gt; reverse, celebrating a victory of the rebels over Philip troops or rather &quot;the power of the Emperor to conquer&quot; (''Roman Imperial Coins'', 4.3). It has been suggested that Jotapianus also issued [[Aureus]], none of which survived.

The coins are the only source for his names, &lt;small&gt;M. F. RV.&lt;/small&gt;, which could be expanded as Marcus Fulvius Rufus. Furthermore, their style suggest that the revolt was short and spread over a small territory, since Jotapianus controlled no major mint.

'''Trajan Decius''' ({{lang-la|Caesar Gaius Messius Quintus Traianus Decius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Decius' name would be inscribed as CAESAR GAIVS MESSIVS QVINTVS TRAIANVS DECIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 201 – June 251), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 249 to 251. In the last year of his reign, he co-ruled with his son [[Herennius Etruscus]] until they were both killed in the [[Battle of Abritus]].

==Early life and rise to power==
[[File:Trajan Decius Ant.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Antoninianus]] of Trajan Decius]]Decius, who was born at [[Budalia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Decius: 249 - 251 AD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anc.Rome&quot; &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;dq=source%3Dgbs_navlinks_s&amp;q=%D0%94%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%83%D1%81#v=snippet&amp;q=Decius%20budalia&amp;f=false Handbook to life in ancient Rome], By Lesley Adkins, Roy A. Adkins, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Sirmium]] in [[Pannonia Inferior]] (now [[Martinci]] and [[Sremska Mitrovica]] in [[Serbia]]), was one of the first among a long succession of future Roman Emperors to originate from the Danube provinces, often simply called Illyricum.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;These men are usually called the Illyrian emperors since they all were born in that province (Illyricum) and were raised to power by legions stationed there&quot;. Joseph Ward Swain, ''The Ancient World''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some of his immediate imperial predecessors such as [[Philip the Arab]] or [[Maximinus I (Thrax)|Maximinus]] who did not have extensive administrative experience before assuming the throne, Decius was a distinguished [[Roman senate|senator]] who had served as [[Roman consul|consul]] in 232, had been governor of [[Moesia]] and [[Germania Inferior]] soon afterwards, served as governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] between 235–238, and was [[urban prefect]] of Rome during the early reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (Marcus Iulius Phillippus).&lt;ref name=Scarre169&gt;Scarre 1995, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 245, Emperor Philip entrusted Decius with an important command on the Danube.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} By the end of 248 or 249, Decius was sent to quell the revolt of [[Pacatianus]] and his troops in Moesia and Pannonia; some modern historians see this rebellion as a reflection of emerging Balkan separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, pp.634-5 (note 106)&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the revolt, Decius let the troops proclaim him Emperor. Philip had to advance against him and was killed near [[Verona]], [[Italy]], in September 249.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, pp.240-241&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] then recognized Decius as Emperor, giving him the attribute ''Traianus'' as a reference to the good emperor [[Trajan]]. According to the Byzantine historian [[Zosimus]], Decius was clothed in purple and forced to undertake the [burdens of] government, despite his reluctance and unwillingness.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, New History I.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and monumental initiatives==
Decius' political program was focused on the restoration of the strength of the State, both militarily opposing the external threats, and restoring the public [[piety]] with a program of renovation of the [[State religion]].

===Reviving the censorship===
Either as a concession to the Senate, or perhaps with the idea of improving public morality, Decius endeavoured to revive the separate office and authority of the [[Roman censor|censor]]. The choice was left to the Senate, who unanimously selected [[Valerian (Roman emperor)|Valerian]] (the future emperor). But Valerian, well aware of the dangers and difficulties attached to the office at such a time, declined the responsibility. The invasion of the [[Goth]]s and Decius' death put an end to the abortive attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

===The Baths of Decius===
During his reign, he proceeded with several building projects in Rome, &quot;including the Thermae Decianae or [[Baths of Decius]] on the Aventine&quot;, which was completed in 252 and survived through to the 16th century; Decius also repaired the Colosseum, which had been damaged by lightning strikes.&lt;ref name=Scarre169&gt;Scarre 1995, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution of Christians==
{{Main|Decian persecution}}
:''See also [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Decius]]''

In January 250, Decius is said to have issued one of the most remarkable Roman imperial edicts. From the numerous surviving texts from Egypt, recording the act of sacrifice, it appears that the edict itself was fairly clear:&lt;ref name=Potter241&gt;Potter 2004, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=All the inhabitants of the empire were required to sacrifice before the magistrates of their community 'for the safety of the empire' by a certain day (the date would vary from place to place and the order may have been that the sacrifice had to be completed within a specified period after a community received the edict). When they sacrificed they would obtain a certificate (libellus) recording the fact that they had complied with the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decius: 249 - 251 AD&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110330183455/http://www.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/en/Decius.html Decius: 249 – 251 AD] University of Michigan. Retrieved March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the certificate would testify the sacrificant's loyalty to the ancestral gods and to the consumption of sacrificial food and drink as well as the names of the officials who were overseeing the sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Potter241/&gt;}}

According to D. S. Potter, Decius did not try to impose the superiority of the Roman pantheon over any other gods. It is very probable that the edict was an attempt to legitimize his position and to respond to a general unease provoked by the passing of the Roman millennium.&lt;ref name=Potter243&gt;Potter 2004, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; While Decius himself may have intended the edict as a way to reaffirm his conservative vision of the Pax Romana and to reassure Rome's citizens that the empire was still secure, it nevertheless sparked a &quot;terrible crisis of authority as various Christian bishops and their flocks reacted to it in different ways.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decius: 249 - 251 AD&quot; /&gt; Measures were first taken demanding that the [[bishop]]s and officers of the church make a sacrifice for the Emperor. The sacrifice was &quot;on behalf of&quot; (Latin ''pro'') the Emperor, not ''to'' the Emperor, since a living Emperor was not considered [[divus|divine]]. Certificates were issued to those who satisfied the commissioners during the persecution of Christians under Decius. Forty-six such certificates have been published, all dating from 250, four of them from [[Oxyrhynchus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/250sacrificecert.html Ancient History Sourcebook]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone, including Christian followers, who refused to offer a sacrifice for the Emperor and the Empire's well-being by a specified date risked torture and execution.&lt;ref name = Scarre170&gt;Scarre 1995, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; A number of prominent Christians did, in fact, refuse to make a sacrifice and were killed in the process, including [[Pope Fabian]] himself in 250, and &quot;anti-Christian feeling[s] led to pogroms at Carthage and Alexandria.&quot;&lt;ref name = Scarre170&gt;Scarre 1995, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, however, towards the end of the second year of Decius' reign, &quot;the ferocity of the [anti-Christian] persecution had eased off, and the earlier tradition of tolerance had begun to reassert itself.&quot;&lt;ref name = Scarre170&gt;Scarre 1995, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church, despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any specific group, never forgot the reign of Decius whom they labelled as that &quot;fierce tyrant&quot;.&lt;ref name = Scarre170&gt;Scarre 1995, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, there was a second outbreak of the [[Antonine Plague]], which at its height from 251 to 266, took the lives of 5,000 daily in Rome. This outbreak is referred to as the &quot;Plague of [[Cyprian]]&quot; (the bishop of [[Carthage]]), where both the plague and the [[persecution of Christians]] were especially severe. Cyprian's biographer [[Pontius of Carthage|Pontius]] gave a vivid picture of the demoralizing effects of the plague{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and Cyprian moralized the event in his essay ''De mortalitate''. In Carthage, the &quot;Decian persecution&quot;, unleashed at the onset of the plague, sought out Christian scapegoats. Decius' edicts were renewed under Valerian in 253 and repealed under his son, [[Gallienus]], in 260-1.

==Fighting the Goths and death==

===The Goths enter the Balkans===
The [[barbarian]] incursions into the Empire were becoming more and more daring and frequent whereas the Empire was facing a serious economic crisis in Decius' time. During his brief reign, Decius engaged in important operations against the [[Goths]], who crossed the Danube to raid districts of Moesia and [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; This is the first considerable occasion the Goths — who would later come to play such an important role — appear in the historical record. The Goths under King [[Cniva]] were surprised by the emperor while besieging [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]] on the Danube; the Goths fled through the difficult terrain of the [[Balkans]], but then doubled back and surprised the Romans near Beroë (modern [[Stara Zagora]]), sacking their camp and dispersing the Roman troops. The Goths then moved to [[Battle of Philippopolis (250)|attack ''Philippopolis'']] (modern [[Plovdiv]]), which fell into their hands.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  The governor of Thrace, [[Titus Julius Priscus]], declared himself Emperor under Gothic protection in opposition to Decius but Priscus's challenge was rendered moot when he was killed soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Scarre169&gt;Scarre 1995, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Then the invaders began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.&lt;ref name=Wolfram46&gt;Wolfram 1988, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Abritus===
{{main|Battle of Abritus}}
In the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general [[Trebonianus Gallus]], intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty. The final engagement, the [[battle of Abrittus]], in which the Goths fought with the courage of despair, under the command of Cniva, took place during the second week of June 251 on swampy ground in the [[Ludogorie]]  (region in northeastern Bulgaria which merges with Dobruja plateau and the Danube Plain to the north) near the small settlement of Abrittus&lt;ref name=&quot;Anc.Rome&quot; /&gt;  or ''Forum Terebronii'' (modern [[Razgrad]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Jordanes]] records that Decius' son [[Herennius Etruscus]] was killed by an arrow early in the battle, and to cheer his men Decius exclaimed, &quot;Let no one mourn; the death of one soldier is not a great loss to the republic.&quot; Nevertheless, Decius' army was entangled in the swamp and annihilated in this battle, while he himself was killed on the field of battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decius: 249 - 251 AD&quot; /&gt; As the historian [[Aurelius Victor]] relates:
{{quote|text=The Decii (ie. ''Decius'' and his son), while pursuing the barbarians across the Danube, died through treachery at Abrittus after reigning two years. ... Very many report that the son had fallen in battle while pressing an attack too boldly; that the father however, has strenuously asserted that the loss of one soldier seemed to him too little to matter. And so he resumed the war and died in a similar manner while fighting vigorously&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, Book of the Caesars 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One literary tradition claims that Decius was betrayed by his successor Trebonianus Gallus, who was involved in a secret alliance with the Goths but this cannot be substantiated and was most likely a later invention since Gallus felt compelled to adopt Decius' younger son, Gaius Valens Hostilianus, as joint emperor even though the latter was too young to rule in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre 1995, pp.168–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.308&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unlikely that the shattered Roman legions would proclaim as emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; Decius was the first Roman Emperor to die in battle against a foreign enemy.&lt;ref name = Scarre170&gt;Scarre 1995, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aemilianus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Aemilian's name would be inscribed as MARCVS AEMILIVS AEMILIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 207/213 – 253), also known as '''Aemilian''', was [[Roman Emperor]] for three months in 253.

Commander of the [[Moesia]]n troops, he obtained an important victory against the invading [[Goths]] and was, for this reason, acclaimed Emperor by his army. He then moved quickly to Italy, where he defeated Emperor [[Trebonianus Gallus]], only to be killed by his own men when another general, [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]], proclaimed himself Emperor and moved against Aemilian with a larger army.

== Biography ==

=== Origins and military career ===

[[Image:Antoninianus-Cornelia Supra-RIC 0030.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cornelia Supera]] (or Supra), was the wife of Aemilianus]]

Aemilian was born in the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. According to the 4th century source ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'', he was born at ''Girba'' (modern [[Djerba]], an island off the coast of [[Tunisia]]) and was a [[Moors|Moor]];&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'', 31.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; a reference in the same source hints that he was born around 207.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'', 31.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th century historian [[Joannes Zonaras]], who calls him a Libyan (that is, coming from western Egypt-eastern Libya) rather than a Moor,&lt;ref name=&quot;zonaras1221&quot;&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras]], ''Epitome Historiarum'', 12.21.&lt;/ref&gt; and another chronicle of the 13th century hold that he was forty at the time of his death in 253.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonaras1222&quot;&gt;Joannes Zonaras, ''Epitome Historiarum'', 12.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his lineage, there are two versions, both exaggerated: while [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and his translator [[Paeanius]] probably defame a failed usurper when they say that he was from an insignificant family,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Breviariun ab Urbe condita'', 9.6; Paeanius, 9.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]] may refer to Aemilian's propaganda when he says that the usurper used his ancestry to take power.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnofantioch150&quot;&gt;[[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], fr. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Aemilian married [[Cornelia Supera]], a woman of African origin; the year of their marriage is unknown, but since both were from the same place, it is possible they married before Aemilian left Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;banchich&quot;&gt;Banchich.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Trebonianus Gallus]] and his son [[Volusianus]] (251–253), Aemilian was sent to the [[Balkans]] to command an army.&lt;ref&gt;John of Antioch says he was ''[[archon]]'' of [[Moesia]] (fr. 150), [[Zosimus]] puts him at the head of the [[Pannonian]] units (''New History'', i.28), while [[Joannes Zonaras]] claims he was commander of the Moesian legions (12.21).&lt;/ref&gt; His primary responsibility was to assure peace along the [[Danube]] frontier, which had been subject to several attacks by the [[Goths]] led by king [[Cniva]].

Gallus secured the throne after the death of emperor [[Decius]] at the hands of Cniva in the [[Battle of Abrittus]] (251), and later had to manage an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] that devastated Rome. He was not popular with the army, mainly due to humiliating treaties signed in 251 with the Goths and  King [[Shapur I]] of Persia who attacked [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. According to John of Antioch, upon his appointment to the Moesian command, Aemilian was already envious of Gallus and plotted treachery against him.  He was also an opponent of the [[Roman Senate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;banchich&quot; /&gt;  and his seditious plans are confirmed by [[Jerome]] and [[Jordanes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''Chronicon'', Ol. 258; [[Jordanes]], ''Romana'', 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victory against the Goths, overthrow of Gallus, short rule and death of Aemilian ===

In 253, the [[Goths]], led by king [[Cniva]], claimed they had not received the tribute due from the Romans according to the treaty of 251. They crossed the border and attacked [[Cappadocia]], [[Pessinus]], and [[Ephesus]].  Modern historians believe that this missing payment was not a change in Roman policy, and the Goths were more likely trying to capitalize on their military prowess.&lt;ref name=&quot;banchich&quot; /&gt; Aemilian had command of the army assigned to defend the area, but the recent defeat at the [[Battle of Abrittus]] put his troops on edge. Aemilian exhorted them, reminding them of Roman honor (according to [[Zosimus]]) and promising tribute from the Goths (according to [[Zonaras]]). The Romans took the Goths by surprise, killing most of them, followed by an invasion of Goth territory resulting in booty and the liberation of prisoners. The Roman soldiers, gathered by Aemilian, acclaimed him Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonaras1221&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'', i.28.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanes claims, however, that Aemilian's troops plundered Roman territory, rather than keep the tribute of the Goths.&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, ''Getica'', 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map of Roman roads in Italy.png|thumb|The [[Flaminian Way]], here in purple, divided into two branches next to modern [[Terni]]; Aemilian, who was descending from north upon Rome, defeated [[Trebonianus Gallus]] on the eastern branch.]]

With his few men, Aemilian left his province unguarded and moved quickly towards [[Rome]] to meet the legitimate emperor Gallus before the latter could receive reinforcements. While Aemilian descended upon Rome along the [[Flaminian Way]], Gallus and Volusianus had him proclaimed &quot;enemy of the State&quot; by the [[Roman senate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;varner&quot;&gt;Varner, Eric, ''Mutilation and Transformation'', Brill Academic Publishers, 2004, ISBN 90-04-13577-4, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; then exited Rome to meet the usurper. This strategy suggests that Aemilian's army was smaller than theirs, as they probably did not expect reinforcements to come in time but trusted their larger army to win the clash.&lt;ref name=&quot;banchich&quot; /&gt; The two armies met at [[Interamna Nahars]] (modern [[Terni]]), at the southern end of the eastern branch of the Flaminia, and Aemilian won the battle;&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, 9.5; Paeanius 9.5, p. 153; Aurelius Victor 31.1&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus and Volusianus fled to the north with a few followers, probably as a delay tactic before the arrival of reinforcements, but at ''Forum Flaminii'' (modern [[San Giovanni Profiamma]]), on the western branch of Flaminia, they were killed by some of their own guards,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnofantioch150&quot; /&gt; who thought that their betrayal could earn them a reward.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 31.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antoninianus Aemilianus-RIC 0015.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Coin of Aemilian, showing at the obverse the god of war [[Mars (god)|Mars]], a reference to the military virtues of the emperor.]]

Aemilian continued towards Rome.  The [[Roman senate]], after a short opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 31.3.&lt;/ref&gt; decided to recognize him as emperor. According to some sources, Aemilian then wrote to the Senate, promising to fight for the Empire in Thrace and against Persia, and to relinquish his power to the Senate, of which he considered himself a general.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonaras1222&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymous Continuator of Cassius Dio'', fr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Aemilian received the titles of ''Pius'', ''Felix'' and ''Pater Patriae'', the ''tribunicia potestas'', and was elevated to the rank of ''[[pontifex maximus]]''; he was not, however, elevated to consulate (possibly a hint of his non-senatorial birth).&lt;ref name=&quot;beale&quot;&gt;Richard Beale, [http://sonic.net/~rbeale/mysite/roman_imperial_coins_of_249253.htm &quot;Roman Imperial Coins of 249–253 A.D.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; His coinage shows that his propaganda focused on his capability as a military commander—he defeated the Goths when nobody thought this possible, and thus he was the right man for the job of restoring the power of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beale&quot; /&gt;

However, [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]], governor of the Rhine provinces, was on his way south with an army which, according to [[Zosimus]], had been called in as a reinforcement by Gallus.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, i.28.3.&lt;/ref&gt; But modern historians believe this army, possibly mobilized for an incumbent campaign in the East, moved only after Gallus' death to support Valerian's bid for power.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David S., ''Prophecy and History in the Crisis of the Roman Empire''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Aemilian's men, fearful of a civil war and Valerian's larger force, mutinied. They killed Aemilian at [[Spoletium]]&lt;ref name=Potter252&gt;Potter (2004), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or at the ''Sanguinarium'' bridge, between ''[[Oricoli|Oriculum]]'' and ''[[Narni]]a'' (half way between Spoletium and Rome), and recognized Valerian as the new emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12.22; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'', 31.2; Zosimus, i.29.1; ''[[Chronographer of 354]]''. Only [[Aurelius Victor]] reports Aemilianus' death by illness (31.3).&lt;/ref&gt;  After Aemilian's death, which happened between late July and mid-September, a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' against him was declared.&lt;ref name=&quot;banchich&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;varner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter252/&gt;

It is possible that the usurper [[Silbannacus]] was an officer left by Aemilian in Rome before moving against Valerian, who later tried to become emperor but then was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Estiot, Sylviane, &quot;L'empereur Silbannacus. Un second antoninien&quot;, in ''Revue numismatique'', 151, 1996, pp. 105–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The troubled administration of emperor Aemilian was perhaps best summed up by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]:
{{cquote|''Aemilianus came from an extremely insignificant family, his reign was even more insignificant, and he was slain in the third month''.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Brevarium ab Urbe condita'', 9.6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Gallienus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|g|æ|l|i|ˈ|iː|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;Gallienus' full title at his death was IMPERATOR CAESAR PVBLIVS LICINIVS EGNATIVS GALLIENVS PIVS FELIX INVICTVS AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS MAXIMVS PERSICVS PONTIFEX MAXIMVS TRIBUNICIAE POTESTATIS XVI IMPERATOR I CONSUL VII PATER PATRIAE, &quot;Emperor Caesar Publius Licinus Egnatius Gallienus Pious Lucky Unconquered Augustus Germanic Maxim Persic Tribunicial Power 16 times Emperor 1 time Consul 7 times Father of the Fatherland&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 218 – 268) was [[Roman Emperor]] with his father [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] from 253 to 260 and alone from 260 to 268. He ruled during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] that nearly caused the collapse of the empire. While he won a number of military victories, he was unable to prevent the secession of important provinces.

==Life==

===Rise to power===
The exact birth date of Gallienus is unknown.  The Greek chronicler [[John Malalas]] and the ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' report that he was about 50 years old at the time of his death, meaning he was born around 218.&lt;ref&gt;It is generally accepted that he was 35 years old when ascended to the throne in 253, see J. Bray (1997), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Mariniana]], who may have been of senatorial rank, possibly the daughter of [[Egnatius Victor Marinianus]], and his brother was [[Valerianus Minor]]. Inscriptions on coins connect him with [[Falerii]] in [[Etruria]], which may have been his birthplace; it has yielded many inscriptions relating to his mother's family, the Egnatii.&lt;ref&gt;R. Syme, ''Historia Augusta Papers'' (Oxford, 1983), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gallienus married [[Cornelia Salonina]] about ten years before his accession to the throne. She was the mother of three princes: [[Valerian II]], who died in 258; [[Saloninus]], who was named co-emperor but was murdered in 260 by the army of general Postumus; and [[Marinianus]], who was killed in 268, shortly after his father was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] was proclaimed Emperor on 22 October 253, he asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to ratify the elevation of Gallienus to Caesar and [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]. He was also designated [[Roman consul|Consul Ordinarius]] for 254.  As [[Marcus Aurelius]] and his adopted brother [[Lucius Verus]] had done a century earlier, Gallienus and his father divided the Empire. Valerian left for the East to stem the Persian threat, and Gallienus remained in Italy to repel the Germanic tribes on the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. [[Tetrarchy|Division of the empire]] had become necessary due to its sheer size and the numerous threats it faced, and it facilitated negotiations with enemies who demanded to communicate directly with the emperor.

===Early reign and the revolt of Ingenuus===
Gallienus spent most of his time in the provinces of the Rhine area ([[Germania Inferior]], [[Germania Superior]], [[Raetia]], and [[Noricum]]), though he almost certainly visited the [[Danube]] area and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] during 253 to 258.  According to Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, he was particularly energetic and successful in preventing invaders from attacking the German provinces and Gaul, despite the weakness caused by Valerian's march on Italy against [[Aemilianus]] in 253.&lt;ref&gt;A. Watson (1999), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to numismatic evidence, he seems to have won many victories there,&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Alfoldi mentions five in ''The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions'', ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, ISBN 0-915018-28-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a victory in [[Roman Dacia]] might also be dated to that period. Even the hostile Latin tradition attributes success to him at this time.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 255 or 257, Gallienus was made Consul again, suggesting that he briefly visited Rome on those occasions, although no record survives.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; During his Danube sojourn (Drinkwater suggests in 255 or 256), he proclaimed his elder son [[Valerian II]] Caesar and thus official heir to himself and Valerian I; the boy probably joined Gallienus on campaign at that time, and when Gallienus moved west to the Rhine provinces in 257, he remained behind on the Danube as the personification of Imperial authority.&lt;ref&gt;J. Drinkwater, ''The Gallic Empire'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987, ISBN 3-515-04806-5), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 258 and 260 (the exact date is unclear), while Valerian was distracted with the ongoing invasion of Shapur in the East, and Gallienus was preoccupied with his problems in the West, [[Ingenuus]], governor of at least one of the Pannonian provinces,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.57; Drinkwater (1987), p.22 suggests he also had responsibility for Moesia.&lt;/ref&gt; took advantage and declared himself emperor. Valerian II had apparently died on the Danube, most likely in 258.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ingenuus may have been responsible for that calamity. Alternatively, the defeat and capture of Valerian at the [[battle of Edessa]] may have been the trigger for the subsequent revolts of Ingenuus, [[Regalianus]], and [[Postumus]].&lt;ref&gt;For a very thorough presentation of the contrasting views, see J. Bray (1997), p.72-73; also, A. Watson (1999), p.230, note 34&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Gallienus reacted with great speed. He left his son [[Saloninus]] as Caesar at [[Cologne]], under the supervision of Albanus (or Silvanus) and the military leadership of Postumus. He then hastily crossed the [[Balkans]], taking with him the new cavalry corps (''comitatus'') under the command of [[Aureolus]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.74–75&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated Ingenuus at [[Mursa]]&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 33,2, Orosius, ''Historiae adversus Paganos'' 7.10, Eutropius 9.8&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sirmium]].&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12.24&lt;/ref&gt; The victory must be attributed mainly to the cavalry and its brilliant commander. Ingenuus was killed by his own guards or committed suicide by drowning himself after the fall of his capital, Sirmium.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.76. J. Fitz, ''Ingenuus et Regalien'', p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of the Alamanni===
A major invasion by the [[Alemanni]] and other Germanic tribes occurred between 258 and 260 (it is hard to fix the precise date of these events),&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; probably due to the vacuum left by the withdrawal of troops supporting Gallienus in the campaign against Ingenuus.  [[Franks]] broke through the lower Rhine, invading [[Gaul]], some reaching as far as southern Spain, sacking Tarraco (modern [[Tarragona]]).&lt;ref name=Watson34&gt;A. Watson (1999), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; The Alamanni invaded, probably through [[Agri Decumates]] (an area between the upper Rhine and the upper Danube),&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.78&lt;/ref&gt; likely followed by the [[Juthungi]].&lt;ref name=Watson34&gt;A. Watson (1999), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; After devastating Germania Superior and Raetia (parts of southern [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]), they entered Italy, the first invasion of the Italian peninsula, aside from its most remote northern regions, since [[Hannibal]] 500 years before. When invaders reached the outskirts of Rome, they were repelled by an improvised army assembled by the Senate, consisting of local troops (probably praetorian guards) and the strongest of the civilian population.&lt;ref name=Bray79&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; On their retreat through northern Italy, they were intercepted and defeated in the [[battle of Mediolanum]] (near present-day [[Milan]]) by Gallienus' army, which had advanced from Gaul, or from the Balkans after dealing with the Franks.&lt;ref name=Bray79&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; The battle of Mediolanum was decisive, and the Alamanni didn't bother the empire for the next ten years. The Juthungi managed to cross the Alps with their valuables and captives from Italy.&lt;ref name=Watson34&gt;A. Watson (1999), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter256&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), p.256&lt;/ref&gt; An historian in the 19th century suggested that the initiative of the Senate gave rise to jealousy and suspicion by Gallienus, thus contributing to his exclusion of senators from military commands.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Duruy, ''History of the Roman Empire'', vol VI, part II, p.418, London, 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

===The revolt of Regalianus===
Around the same time, [[Regalianus]], a military commander of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], was proclaimed Emperor. The reasons for this are unclear, and the ''Historia Augusta'' (almost the sole resource for these events) does not provide a credible story. It is possible the seizure can be attributed to the discontent of the civilian and military provincials, who felt the defense of the province was being neglected.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.82,83&lt;/ref&gt;

Regalianus held power for some six months and issued coins bearing his image. After some success against the [[Sarmatians]], his revolt ended when the [[Roxolani]] invaded [[Pannonia]] and killed Regalianus in taking the city of [[Sirmium]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.83&lt;/ref&gt; There is a suggestion that Gallienus invited Roxolani to attack Regalianus, but other historians dismiss the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;T. Nagy, ''Les moments historiques de Budapest'', vol.II, 1962, for the former and J. Fitz, ''Ingenuus at Regalien'', p.50 for the latter, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.83&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the invasion was finally checked by Gallienus near [[Verona]] and that he directed the restoration of the province, probably in person.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fitz, ''LA PANNONIE SOUS GALLIEN'', Latomus, vol.148, Brussels, 1976, pp.5–81, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of Valerian, revolt of Macrianus===
In the East, Valerian was confronted with serious troubles. Bands of &quot;Scythai&quot; began a naval raid of [[Pontus#Roman_province|Pontus]], in the northern part of modern Turkey. After ravaging the province, they moved south into [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]]. A Roman army from Antioch, under Valerian, tried to intercept them but failed. According to [[Zosimus]], this army was infected by a plague that gravely weakened it. In that condition, this army had to repel  a new invasion of the province of [[Mesopotamia]] by [[Shapur I]], ruler of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. The invasion occurred probably in the early spring of 260.&lt;ref&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman army was defeated at the [[Battle of Edessa]], and Valerian was taken prisoner. Shapur's army raided [[Cilicia]] and [[Cappadocia]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), sacking, as Shapur's inscriptions claim, 36 cities. It took a rally by an officer [[Balista|Callistus]] (Balista), a fiscal official named [[Macrianus Major|Fulvius Macrianus]], the remnants of the Roman army in the east, and [[Odaenathus|Odenathus]] and his [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] horsemen to turn the tide against Shapur.&lt;ref&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), pp.255–256&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanids were driven back, but Macrianus proclaimed his two sons [[Quietus]] and [[Macrianus Minor|Macrianus]] (sometimes misspelled Macrinus) as emperors.&lt;ref name=Potter256&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Coins struck for them in major cities of the East indicate acknowledgement of the usurpation. The two Macriani left Quietus, Ballista, and, presumably, Odenathus to deal with the Persians while they invaded Europe with an army of 30,000 men, according to the ''Historia Augusta''. At first they met no opposition.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', ''The two Gallienii'', II.6&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Pannonian legions joined the invaders, being resentful of the absence of Gallienus. He sent his successful commander Aureolus against the rebels, however, and the decisive battle was fought in the spring or early summer of 261, most likely in Illyricum, although [[Zonaras]] locates it in Pannonia. In any case, the army of the usurpers was defeated and surrendered, and their two leaders were killed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the battle, the rebellion of Postumus had already started, so Gallienus had no time to deal with the rest of the usurpers, namely Balista and Quietus. He came to an agreement with Odenathus, who had just returned from his victorious Persian expedition. Odenathus received the title of ''dux Romanorum'' and besieged the usurpers, who were based at [[Emesa]]. Eventually, the people of Emesa killed Quietus, and Odenathus arrested and executed Balista about November 261.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

===The revolt of Postumus===
After the defeat at Edessa, Gallienus lost control over the provinces of Britain, Spain, parts of Germania, and a large part of Gaul when another general, [[Postumus]], declared his own realm (usually known today as the [[Gallic Empire]]). The revolt partially coincided with that of [[Macrianus Major|Macrianus]] in the East. Gallienus had installed his son Saloninus and his guardian, [[Silvanus (praetorian prefect)|Silvanus]], in Cologne in 258. Postumus, a general in command of troops on the banks of the Rhine, defeated some raiders and took possession of their spoils. Instead of returning it to the original owners, he preferred to distribute it amongst his soldiers. When news of this reached Silvanus, he demanded the spoils be sent to him. Postumus made a show of submission, but his soldiers mutinied and proclaimed him Emperor. Under his command, they besieged Cologne, and after some weeks the defenders of the city opened the gates and handed Saloninus and Silvanus to Postumus, who had them killed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.133&lt;/ref&gt;  The dating of these events was long uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Älfoldi, &quot;The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions&quot;, ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.359, note 5&lt;/ref&gt; but an [[Augsburg Victory Altar|inscription]] discovered in 1992 at Augsburg indicates that Postumus had been proclaimed Emperor by September of 260.&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Bakker. &quot;Raetien unter Postumus. Das Siegesdenkmal einer Juthungenschlacht im Jahre 260 n. Chr. aus Augsburg.&quot; ''Germania'' 71, 1993, pp. 369–386.&lt;/ref&gt; Postumus claimed the consulship for himself and one of his associates, Honoratianus, but according to D.S. Potter, he never tried to unseat Gallienus or invade Italy.&lt;ref&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving news of the murder of his son, Gallienus began gathering forces to face Postumus.  The invasion of the Macriani forced him to dispatch Aureolus with a large force to oppose them, however, leaving him with insufficient troops to battle Postumus. After some initial defeats, the army of Aureolus, having defeated the Macriani, rejoined him, and Postumus was expelled. Aureolus was entrusted with the pursuit and deliberately allowed Postumus to escape and gather new forces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.136–137&lt;/ref&gt; Gallienus returned in 263&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Älfoldi, &quot;The Numbering of the Victories of the Emperor Gallienus and of the Loyalty of his Legions&quot;, ''Numismatic Chronicle'', 1959, reprinted New York, Attic Books, 1977, as cited in J. Bray (1997), p.359, note 27&lt;/ref&gt; or 265&lt;ref&gt;D.S.Potter (2004) p.263&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounded Postumus in an unnamed Gallic city. During the siege, Gallienus was severely wounded by an arrow and had to leave the field. The standstill persisted until his later death,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.138&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gallic Empire]] remained independent until 274.

===The revolt of Aemilianus===
In 262, the mint in [[Alexandria]] started to again issue coins for Gallienus, demonstrating that Egypt had returned to his control after suppressing the revolt of the Macriani. In spring of 262, the city was wrenched by civil unrest as a result of a new revolt. The rebel this time was the prefect of Egypt, [[Mussius Aemilianus|Lucius Mussius Aemilianus]], who had already given support to the revolt of the Macriani. The correspondence of bishop [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] provides a commentary on the background of invasion, civil war, plague, and famine that characterized this age.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing he could not afford to lose control of the vital Egyptian granaries, Gallienus sent his general Theodotus against Aemilianus, probably by a naval expedition. The decisive battle probably took place near Thebes, and the result was a clear defeat of Aemilianus.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.147&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Gallienus became Consul three more times in 262, 264, and 266.

===Herulian invasions, revolt of Aureolus, conspiracy and death===
In the years 267–269, Goths and other barbarians invaded the empire in great numbers. Sources are extremely confused on the dating of these invasions, the participants, and their targets. Modern historians are not even able to discern with certainty whether there were two or more of these invasions or a single prolonged one. It seems that, at first, a major naval expedition was led by the [[Heruli]] starting from north of the [[Black Sea]] and leading in the ravaging of many cities of Greece (among them, [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]). Then another, even more numerous army of invaders started a second naval invasion of the empire. The Romans defeated the barbarians on sea first. Gallienus' army then won a battle in [[Thrace]], and the Emperor pursued the invaders. According to some historians, he was the leader of the army who won the great [[Battle of Naissus]], while the majority believes that the victory must be attributed to his successor, [[Claudius II]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.279–288, Pat Southern 2001, p.109. Also see Alaric Watson 1999, p.215, David S. Potter 2004, p.266, Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'' (transl. by Thomas J. Dunlap), University of California Press, 1988. ISBN 0-520-06983-8, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 268, at some time before or soon after the battle of Naissus, the authority of Gallienus was challenged by [[Aureolus]], commander of the cavalry stationed in [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]), who was supposed to keep an eye on [[Postumus]]. Instead, he acted as deputy to Postumus until the very last days of his revolt, when he seems to have claimed the throne for himself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.290–291&lt;/ref&gt; The decisive battle took place at what is now [[Pontirolo Nuovo]] near Milan; Aureolus was clearly defeated and driven back to Milan.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), p.292&lt;/ref&gt; Gallienus laid siege to the city but was murdered during the siege. There are differing accounts of the murder, but the sources agree that most of Gallienus' officials wanted him dead.&lt;ref&gt;D.S.Potter (2004), p.264&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Historia Augusta]], an unreliable source compiled long after the events it describes,&lt;ref&gt;R. Syme (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; a conspiracy was led by the commander of the guard [[Aurelius Heraclianus]] and [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]]. Marcianus's role in the conspiracy is not confirmed by any other ancient source.

Cecropius, commander of the Dalmatians, spread the word that the forces of Aureolus were leaving the city, and Gallienus left his tent without his bodyguard, only to be struck down by Cecropius.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta, The two Gallieni'', XIV.4–11&lt;/ref&gt; One version has Claudius selected as Emperor by the conspirators, another chosen by Gallienus on his death bed; the Historia Augusta was concerned to substantiate the descent of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] from Claudius, and this may explain its accounts, which do not involve Claudius in the murder. The other sources ([[Zosimus]] i.40 and [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] xii.25) report that the conspiracy was organized by Heraclianus, Claudius, and [[Aurelian]].

According to Aurelius Victor and Zonaras, on hearing the news that Gallienus was dead, the Senate in Rome ordered the execution of his family (including his brother Valerianus and son Marinianus) and their supporters, just before receiving a message from Claudius to spare their lives and deify his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bray (1997), pp.307–309. A. Watson (1999), pp.41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb of Gallienus is thought to be located to the south of Rome, at the IXth mile of [[Via Appia]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel N. C. Lieu, Domikic Montserat (editors). ''From Constantine to Julian: Pagan and Byzantine Views: A Source History'', Routledge, ISBN 0-203-73029-1, note 38 on pp.54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Gallienus was not treated favorably by ancient historians,&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat. ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'', Routledge, London and New York, 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to the secession of Gaul and [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyra]] and his inability to win them back. According to modern scholar Pat Southern, some historians now see him in a more positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallienus produced some useful reforms.

===Military reforms===
He contributed to military history as the first to commission primarily [[cavalry]] units, the [[Comitatenses]], that could be dispatched anywhere in the Empire in short order. This reform arguably created a precedent for the future emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]]. The biographer [[Aurelius Victor]] reports that Gallienus forbade [[Roman Senate|senators]] from becoming military commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''De Caesaribus'', 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; This policy undermined senatorial power, as more reliable [[Eques (ancient Rome)|equestrian]] commanders rose to prominence. In Southern's view, these reforms and the decline in senatorial influence not only helped Aurelian to salvage the Empire, but they also make Gallienus one of the emperors most responsible for the creation of the [[Dominate]], along with [[Septimius Severus]], Diocletian, and Constantine I.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pp. 2-3, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Decree of Toleration===
The capture of Valerian in the year 259 forced Gallienus to issue the first official declaration of tolerance with regard to the Christians, restoring their places of worship and cemeteries, therefore implying a recognition of the property of the Church. However, the edict did not turn Christianity into an official religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Papacy: An Encyclopedia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7VDcmDeLuV4C|publisher = Psychology Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 9780415922302|language = en|first = Charles|last = Piétri|editor-last = Levillain|editor-first = Philippe|page = 1156|chapter = Prosecutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titus Fulvius Iunius Quietus''' (died 261) was a [[Roman usurper]] against [[Roman Emperor]] [[Gallienus]].

Quietus was the son of [[Macrianus Major|Fulvius Macrianus]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 757&lt;/ref&gt; and a noblewoman, possibly named Iunia. According to ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', he was a military [[tribune]] under [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]],&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, Tyranni Triginta, 12:10&lt;/ref&gt; but this information is challenged by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained the imperial office with his brother [[Macrianus Minor]], after the capture of Emperor Valerian in the Sassanid campaign of 260.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 758&lt;/ref&gt; With the lawful heir, [[Gallienus]], being far away in the West, the soldiers elected the two emperors. The support of his father, controller of the imperial treasure, and the influence of [[Balista]], [[Praetorian prefect]] of the late Emperor Valerian, proved instrumental in his promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Körner, www.roman-emperors.org/galusurp.htm#Note%202&lt;/ref&gt;

Quietus and Macrianus, elected [[Roman consul|consul]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Körner, www.roman-emperors.org/galusurp.htm#Note%202&lt;/ref&gt; had to face the Emperor [[Gallienus]], at the time in the West. Quietus and Ballista stayed in the eastern provinces, while his brother and father marched their army to Europe to seize control of the [[Roman Empire]]. After the defeat and deaths of his brother and father in [[Thrace]] in 261,&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Quietus lost the control of the provinces in favour of Septimus [[Odaenathus]] of [[Palmyra]], a loyal client king of the Romans who had helped push the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] out of the eastern provinces and recovered [[Roman Mesopotamia]] in 260.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to flee to the city of [[Emesa]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 757&lt;/ref&gt; he was besieged there by Odaenathus,&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; during the course of which he was killed by its inhabitants, possibly instigated by Ballista.&lt;ref&gt;([[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] xii.24)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayals In Popular Fiction ==
Quietus appears in Harry Sidebottoms historical fiction novel series as one of the series antagonists.

'''P. C(assius?) Regalianus''' (died 260) was a [[Dacia|Dacian]] general&lt;ref name=Akerman&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z-NCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Regalianus#v=onepage&amp;q=Regalianus&amp;f=false|title=A descriptive catalogue of rare and unedited Roman coins:from the earliest period of the Roman coinage, to the extinction of the empire under Constantinus Paleologos|first=John Yonge |last=Akerman|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; who turned against the [[Roman Empire]] and became himself emperor for a brief period, being murdered by the hands who raised him to power.&lt;ref name=Akerman /&gt;

==Career==
The main source of information is the unreliable ''[[Historia Augusta]]''. Other sources are [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], who calls him [[Trebellianus]], and [[Aurelius Victor]] and the ''[[Epitome]]''{{which|date=April 2014}}, which call him Regillianus. About his origin, the ''[[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Tyranni Triginta]]'' says he was a [[Dacia]]n, a kinsman of [[Decebalus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Tyranni Triginta, 10:8&lt;/ref&gt; He probably was of senatorial rank, and had received military promotion from the Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]].&lt;ref name=Jones762&gt;Jones, p. 762&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat and capture of Valerian in the east (260), the border populations felt insecure, and elected their own emperors to guarantee they would have leaders against the foreign threats.&lt;ref name=Leadbetter&gt;{{cite web |last=Leadbetter |first=William |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/ingen.htm |title=Regalianus (260 A.D.) |work=De Imperatoribus Romanis |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The population and the army of the province of [[Pannonia]] had chosen [[Ingenuus]], and elected him emperor, but the lawful emperor, Gallienus, had defeated the usurper.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallienus had moved to [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]], however, to deal with an invasion of the [[Alamanni]]. The local population, facing the threat of the [[Sarmatian]]s, elected Regalianus emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; who raised his wife, [[Sulpicia Dryantilla]], who was of noble lineage, to the rank of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' to strengthen his position.&lt;ref name=Leadbetter /&gt; Regalianus bravely fought thereafter against the Sarmatians. Short time after his victory, he was killed by a coalition of his own people and of the [[Roxolani]].&lt;ref name=Leadbetter /&gt; 

A few anecdotes survive about this man, in the brief biographical sketch of him given in the Book on [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'': it is stated for example that he was raised to the throne because of his name (Regalianus, &quot;of a king&quot; or &quot;kingly&quot;); when his soldiers heard this jest they greeted Regalianus as their emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Tyranni Triginta, 10:6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulpius Cornelius Laelianus'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 492&quot;&gt;Martindale, pg. 492&lt;/ref&gt; (also incorrectly referred to as ''Lollianus'' and ''Aelianus'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] against [[Postumus]], the emperor of the [[Gallic Empire]]. His revolt lasted from approximately late February to early June 269.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Little is known about Laelianus. He shares the same ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' as a prominent Spanish noble family, the [[Ulpia (gens)|Ulpii]], that included [[Trajan]] among its members, and may have been a relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt;  This is supported by the strong allusion to Hispania on an [[:Image:Aureus Laelius-RIC 0001.jpg|aureus]] he struck, which featured the design of Hispania reclining with a rabbit to her side.  If he indeed was a relative, this may be the reason Spain allied itself with [[Claudius II]], after the death of Postumus, seemingly without a struggle.

==Rule==
Laelianus declared himself emperor at [[Mainz|Moguntiacum]] in February/March 269.&lt;ref&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''; Potter, pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; after repulsing a Germanic invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 91; Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his exact position is unknown, he is believed to have been a senior officer under Postumus,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; either the ''[[legatus]]'' of [[Germania Superior]]&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; or the commander of [[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt;  Laelianus represented a strong danger to Postumus because of the two legions he commanded (''Primigenia'' in Moguntiacum and [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII ''Augusta'']] in [[Strasbourg|Argentoratum]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, his rebellion lasted only about two months before he was executed,&lt;ref&gt;Polfer, ''Laelianus''; Canduci, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; reputedly by his own soldiers, or by Postumus' troops after a siege of Laelianus' capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 492&quot;&gt;Martindale, pg. 492&lt;/ref&gt;  The siege of Moguntiacum was also fatal for Postumus; it is said he was slain when he refused to allow his troops to plunder the city following its capture.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Laelianus (under the name ''Lollianus'') is listed among the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]] in the [[Historia Augusta]].

'''Marcus Cassianius Latinius Postumus'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 720&quot;&gt;Jones &amp; Martindale (1971), p. 720&lt;/ref&gt; was a  Roman commander of provincial origin who ruled as emperor in the west. The Roman army in Gaul threw off its allegiance to [[Gallienus]] around the year 260,&lt;ref name=&quot;dates&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The year of Postumus' accession was either 259 or 260. In the past, the year 259 was favoured; today, however, most scholars consider that the summer or fall of 260 is the more likely date that he was hailed emperor, according to Polfer (''Postumus'') and J.F. Drinkwater (1987), p. 97. The ''terminus ante quem'' is an inscription from September 260 naming Postumus as emperor: Bakker (1993), pp. 369–386. Other dates cited in this article must be pushed back one year for those who take 259 as the year of Postumus' accession. See Drinkwater (1987), pp. 95-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and Postumus assumed the title and powers of emperor in the provinces of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Germania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Hispania]], thereby founding what scholars have dubbed the [[Gallic Empire]]. He ruled for the better part of ten years&lt;ref name=&quot;trib. pot.&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Based on numismatic evidence, Postumus' rule extended over ten periods of tribunician power, each conventionally lasting for one year beginning on December 10. Regardless of which year Postumus assumed the purple (259 or 260), his rule must have stretched across ten such years. See Drinkwater (1987), pp. 93, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; before he was murdered by his own troops.

==Life==

===Rise to power===
Little is known about the early life of Postumus. He has been claimed as a [[Batavii|Batavian]];&lt;ref&gt;State, Paul F., ''A Brief History of the Netherlands'', Infobase Publishing, 2008, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; certainly his coinage honours deities—Hercules Magusanus and Hercules Deusoniensis—who would have been popular among the Batavians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 1987, pp. 162-3&quot;&gt;Drinkwater (1987), pp. 162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hercules Magusanus was probably an ''[[interpretatio romana]]'' translation of the Germanic deity [[Donar]].&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Nic (2006): ''Roman Auxiliary Cavalryman: AD 14-193'', ISBN 1841769738, p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deusoniensis'' may refer to the town of Deuso, located in or near Batavian territory and likely to be identified with [[Diessen]]; it has been hypothesized that Postumus himself was born in Deuso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaalarchieftilburg.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=327|title=Regionaal Archief Tilburg - II. Romeinen in Deusone|language=Dutch|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these relatively obscure provincial origins, Postumus would have risen through the ranks of the army until he held command of the Roman forces &quot;among the Celts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is [[Zosimus]]', quoted in Drinkwater (1987), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; What his precise title was is not definitely known,&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; though he may plausibly have been promoted by the emperor [[Valerian (Roman emperor)|Valerian]] to the position of [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|imperial legate]] of [[Germania Inferior|Lower Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 720&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 257&quot;&gt;Potter (2004), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Postumus was evidently in favour at court, and, according to König, was granted an honorary consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 259, Valerian was campaigning in the east against the Persians, while his son and co-emperor [[Gallienus]] was preoccupied with the situation on the [[Danube|Danubian frontier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 79&quot;&gt;Southern (2001), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently Gallienus left his son, [[Saloninus]], and military commanders, including Postumus, to protect the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Postumus''&lt;/ref&gt;  Amid the chaos of an invasion by the [[Alamanni]] and [[Franks]], and spurred on by news of the [[Battle of Edessa|defeat and capture]] of Valerian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 79&quot;/&gt; the army in [[Gaul]] revolted and proclaimed Postumus emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 256&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci 88&quot;&gt;Canduci (2010), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 89&quot;/&gt;

The trigger was their defeat in 260&lt;ref name=&quot;dates&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt; of a [[Juthungi]]an army which was returning from [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]] laden with prisoners, even though they had been repulsed by Gallienus at [[Mediolanum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 256&quot;&gt;Potter (2004), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the command of Postumus and [[Marcus Simplicinius Genialis]], the Roman army crushed the Juthungi, and Postumus proceeded to distribute the captured spoils to the legions he commanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 257&quot;/&gt;  Saloninus, on the advice of his [[praetorian prefect]] [[Silvanus (praetorian prefect)|Silvanus]] (who had coordinated Roman policy in Gaul alongside Postumus), demanded the transfer of the recovered booty to his residence at [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]] (Cologne).&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;
Postumus assembled his army and made a show of reluctantly enforcing this command, thus inviting his troops to instead throw off their allegiance to Gallienus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 89&quot;&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The troops accordingly proclaimed Postumus emperor and proceeded to besiege and attack Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, trapping Saloninus and Silvanus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 257&quot;/&gt; After breaching the walls of the city, Postumus had Silvanus and Saloninus killed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 257&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 89&quot;/&gt; although his supporters later claimed that it was the native Gauls who were responsible for the murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;&gt;Southern (2001), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Later he erected a triumphal arch to celebrate his victory.

===Establishment of a Gallic empire===
[[File:Postumus Treves aureus 268 gold 7400g.jpg|thumb|left|Postumus [[aureus]], 268, [[Treves]], gold 7.40g.]]
Postumus was immediately recognized as emperor in [[Gaul]] (except perhaps for [[Narbonensis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 257&quot;/&gt;), the two [[Germania]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; and [[Raetia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;  By 261, [[Britannia]], [[Narbonensis|Gallia Narbonensis]] and [[Hispania]] had also acknowledged him as emperor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; possibly after an expedition to Britain in the winter of 260/261.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He established his capital in northern Gaul, probably at [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; or [[Augusta Treverorum]],&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), pp. 146, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; and then proceeded to set up many of the traditional Roman legislative and executive structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 97&quot;&gt;Southern (2001), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the position of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]], he immediately assumed the office of [[Roman consul|consul]] alongside a colleague, [[Honoratianus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 260&quot;&gt;Potter (2004), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Like his imperial predecessors, he became the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' of the state&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 260&quot;/&gt; and assumed [[Tribune|tribunician]] power each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 97&quot;/&gt; He is thought to have established a [[Roman Senate|senate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci 88&quot;/&gt; perhaps on the basis of the Council of the Three Gauls or provincial councils,&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Pretorian Guard|praetorian guard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; one of whose officers was to become the future Gallic emperor [[Victorinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his power base, the chief members of Postumus’ administration appeared to have been of northern Gallic origin, and indeed, the entire administration soon became rapidly Gallicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 261&quot;&gt;Potter (2004), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Victorinus]] and [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]], important members of the government, hailed from this region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 261&quot;/&gt;

Postumus represented himself as the restorer of Gaul (''Restitutor Galliarum'') and the bringer of security to the provinces (''Salus Provinciarum'') on some of his coins;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; prior to 10 December 261,&lt;ref name=&quot;dates&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt; he also took the title of ''Germanicus maximus'', a title he earned after successfully defending Gaul against the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt; His principal objective in assuming the purple appeared to be the restoration and defence of the Rhine frontier and the surrounding area, a task that he approached with vigour, earning the admiration of the ancient authors, who declared that he restored the security that the provinces had enjoyed in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; So successful was he in the task of restoring peace and security to the provinces under his direct control that the coins issued by Postumus were of better workmanship and higher precious metal content than coins issued by Gallienus;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 118&quot;&gt;Southern (2001), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; his control of the Spanish and British mining regions was presumably crucial in this regard,&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his employment of master minters who would have come into Gaul with Gallienus.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Postumus fought successful campaigns against the Franks and Alamanni in 262 and 263; following his victory over them in 263, he assumed the title ''Germanicus Maximus'', after which his coin-types celebrated peaceful themes such as ''Felicitas Augusti'' for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), pp. 30, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; After having spent much of the last four years pushing the [[Franks]] out of Gaul, Postumus then recruited Frankish troops to fight against other Franks, probably dispersed within existing Roman army units.&lt;ref&gt;Southern (2001), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars continue to debate whether Postumus originally intended to dislodge Gallienus from Rome or was content to rule only the western provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt; From the beginning of his usurpation, Postumus had made it clear that he had no immediate intentions to make a bid for Rome, that his priority was for Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 89&quot;/&gt; Postumus’ powerbase was Gaul and his main responsibility was the defense of the Rhine provinces. If he marched against Gallienus, then he would be exposing his heartland not only to the Germanic tribes but also potentially to any number of usurpers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 98&quot;/&gt;  Perhaps he hoped to achieve some official recognition from Gallienus; what is clear, however, is that Postumus was not overtly separatist and did not revive the 1st-century dream of an independent ''Galliarum imperium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt; (See [[Julius Sabinus]] and [[revolt of the Batavi]].) The forms, titles, and administrative structures of Postumus’ principate remained conventionally Roman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 28&quot;&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confrontation with Gallienus===
[[File:090 Gallienus.jpg|175px|thumb|Coin of the Emperor Gallienus, from whom Postumus usurped power.]]
For four years Gallienus had been too distracted by Germanic invasions and other usurpers in the east to turn his attention to the situation to his north and west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;&gt;Potter (2004), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;  This changed in 265 when Gallienus launched a campaign to defeat Postumus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 100&quot;/&gt;  After some initial success against Postumus, his first attempt failed when Postumus managed to escape from a precarious situation due to the carelessness of Gallienus’ cavalry commander [[Aureolus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Postumus''&lt;/ref&gt; leading to Aureolus’ demotion and eventual abandonment of Gallienus in 267.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci 89&quot;&gt;Canduci (2010), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A second campaign, led by Gallienus himself, also seemed to have the advantage over Postumus, but while Gallienus was besieging a city in Gaul (perhaps [[Augusta Treverorum]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 100&quot;&gt;Southern (2001), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;), he was wounded and forced to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 89, who cites [[Zonaras]] (12.24.13-18) as the ancient authority for these events.&lt;/ref&gt; After his failed attempt at defeating Postumus, Gallienus was occupied with crises in the rest of his empire and did not confront Postumus again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt; Gallienus nevertheless did manage to wrest control of Raetia from Postumus during these years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 100&quot;/&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2013}}

===Final years===
By the end of 265, Postumus’ coin issues were triumphantly commemorating the victory over Gallienus, and the festivities celebrating his ''[[quinquennalia]] '' continued into the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Postumus''&lt;/ref&gt; Very little troubled the reign of Postumus from 265 to 268; archaeological evidence, such as it is, points to a general return to peace and normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 266, Postumus became consul for the fourth time, taking as his colleague [[Victorinus|Marcus Piavonius Victorinus]], a Gallic noble who was also a senior military officer; his selection to such a high-profile position may be seen as an attempt to broaden Postumus’ base of support.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The year 268 saw the issuing of the ‘Labours of Hercules’ series of gold coins in honour of Postumus’ favourite god.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), pp. 32, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; A sudden debasement of the coinage later that year shows that Postumus was facing increasing financial difficulties, due perhaps to a disruption of silver production in the Spanish mines&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; or the need to buy off an increasingly discontented army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;&gt;Polfer, ''Postumus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Such discontent must probably have been due to the army’s frustration with Postumus’ failure to take advantage of a golden opportunity to move against Gallienus in 268.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Aureolus, the general who was in command of [[Mediolanum]] in Gallienus’ interest, rebelled and ultimately declared for Postumus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;/&gt; The city of Mediolanum and its north Italian and [[Raetia]]n hinterland would have been critical to Postumus if he planned to march on Rome. For whatever reason, Postumus failed to support Aureolus, who was besieged by Gallienus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci 89&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern (2001), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the end of the northern summer in 268, the events at Mediolanum were to see the assassination of Gallienus, the defeat of Aureolus, and the accession of [[Claudius II Gothicus|Claudius II]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter (2004), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  It also triggered a sequence of events that would see the end of Postumus’ rule in Gaul.

===Fall===
[[File:Postumus aureus in a pendant.jpg|thumb|Aureus of Postumus, within a [[pendant]]]]
Postumus assumed his fifth consulship on 1 January 269,&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt; but the army in [[Germania Superior]] raised a usurper in early 269.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt; [[Laelianus]], one of Postumus’ top military leaders and the governor of [[Germania Superior]], was declared emperor in [[Mainz|Mogontiacum]] by the local garrison and surrounding troops ([[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter (2004), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Postumus was able to capture Mogontiacum and kill Laelianus within a few months, he was unable to control his own troops, who wished to put Mogontiacum to the sack. When Postumus tried to restrain them, his men turned on him and killed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polfer, ''Postumus''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci 89&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor 33.8; Eutropius 9.9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutineers set up [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]], a common soldier, as emperor. Marius held sway for a short while before being overthrown by [[Victorinus]], Postumus’ erstwhile colleague in the consulship and tribune of the praetorian guard.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1987), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the [[Gallic Empire]] lost Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Potter (2004), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coinage ==

Postumus has been of particular interest to numismatists, in light of the high quality and relative abundance of his coin issues. His ‘Labours of Hercules’ series is particularly renowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drinkwater 1987, pp. 162-3&quot;/&gt;

'''Marcus Piavonius Victorinus'''&lt;ref name=Martindale965&gt;Martindale, p. 965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some of the inscriptions record his name as M. Piavvonius Victorinus, as does the first release of coins from the Colonia mint. A mosaic from Augusta Treverorum (Trier) lists him as Piaonius.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Gallic Empire|emperor in the Gallic provinces]] from 269 to 271,&lt;ref name=Polfer&gt;Polfer, ''Victorinus''&lt;/ref&gt; following the brief reign of [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]]. He was murdered by a jealous husband whose wife he tried to seduce.

==Reign==
Hailing from [[Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Victorinus was born to a family of great wealth,&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt; and was a soldier under [[Postumus]], the first of the so-called Gallic emperors.&lt;ref name=Martindale965 /&gt;  He showed considerable ability, as he held the title of tribunus praetorianorum (tribune of the praetorians) in 266/267,&lt;ref name=Martindale965 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Canduci92&gt;Canduci, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and rose swiftly to become co-[[consul]] with Postumus in 268.&lt;ref name=Southern118&gt;Southern, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Canduci92 /&gt;  It is also possible that Postumus then elevated him to the post of [[praetorian prefect]].&lt;ref name=Potter266&gt;Potter, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

After engineering the death of Marius, Victorinus was declared emperor by the troops located at [[Trier|Augusta Treverorum]] in the fall of 269.&lt;ref  name=Potter266 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  His principal concern was to prevent the western provinces from submitting to the central authority of the [[Roman Empire]], a fact made clear to him from the first few weeks when only the provinces of [[Gaul]], [[Germania]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]] recognised him. [[Hispania]] deserted the Gallic Empire and declared its loyalty to [[Claudius Gothicus]].&lt;ref name=Potter266 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt; Claudius then sent his trusted general [[Placidianus]] to south-east Gaul with instructions to bring over as many of the wavering cities as he could.&lt;ref name=Southern118 /&gt; Very quickly Placidianus captured [[Cularo]] (ancient [[Grenoble]]), but did not proceed any further.&lt;ref name=Potter266 /&gt;

The presence of Placidianus inspired the city of [[Autun|Augustodunum Haeduorum]] to abandon Victorinus and declare its intention to declare for [[Claudius Gothicus]].&lt;ref name=Southern118 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter266 /&gt;  This forced Victorinus to march south and besiege it, where it fell after seven months, after which Victorinus’ troops plundered and destroyed the city.&lt;ref name=Southern118 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Canduci92 /&gt; Victorinus returned to [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]] in triumph.&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt; It remains a mystery just why Claudius did not authorise Placidianus to go to the relief of Augustodunum Haeduorum; however, it is speculated that Claudius, who was fully engaged either in Italy against the [[Alamanni]] or in the [[Balkans]] against the [[Goths]], did not wish to open a second theatre of operations in Gaul, which would not only have involved a major military effort, but would also have required Claudius to assume responsibility for the defense of the [[Rhine]] frontier had he been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Alaric |year=1999 |title=Aurelian and the Third Century |location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that Claudius was having some difficulties in the East, which also occupied his attention.&lt;ref name=Potter266 /&gt;

Victorinus was murdered at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&lt;ref name=Martindale965 /&gt; in early 271&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; by Attitianus, one of his officers, whose wife Victorinus had supposedly seduced.&lt;ref name=Southern119&gt;Southern, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Canduci92 /&gt;  Since the motive was personal and not political,&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Southern119 /&gt; Victorinus' mother, [[Victoria (Roman usurper)|Victoria]] (or Vitruvia), was able to continue to hold power after the death of Victorinus and she arranged for his deification and, after considerable payment to the troops, the appointment of [[Tetricus I]] as his successor.&lt;ref name=Southern119 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Polfer /&gt; Another military commander appears to have been proclaimed as the emperor [[Domitianus II (usurper)|Domitianus II]], but was soon eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorinus is listed among the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''. The (dubious) ''Historia Augusta'' equally has a short description of [[Victorinus Junior]], allegedly the son of Victorinus, who was appointed emperor by his family the day his father was murdered, and would have been killed immediately afterwards by the troops. The ''Historia Augusta'' also says that both father and son were buried near Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium in marble tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Tyranni Triginta'', 7:1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudius II''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Valerius Claudius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Claudius' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS VALERIVS CLAVDIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;&gt;Jones, pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt; May 10, 210 – July 270), commonly known as '''Claudius Gothicus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 268 to 270. During his reign he fought successfully against the [[Alamanni]] and scored a victory against the [[Goths]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]]. He died after succumbing to a [[Plague of Cyprian|plague (perhaps smallpox)]] that ravaged the provinces of the Empire.

== Early Life And Origin ==
Claudius' origin is [[Illyrians|Illyrian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/283105/Illyria Illyria ]
Several of the most outstanding emperors of the late Roman Empire were of Illyrian origin, including Claudius II Gothicus,&lt;/ref&gt; Born on May 10, 210,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;/&gt; he was either from [[Sirmium]] in [[Pannonia Inferior]] or from [[Naissus]] [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] (in [[Moesia Superior]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;&gt;Weigel, www.roman-emperors.org/claudgot.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military Career and rise to power==
Claudius had served with the Roman army for all his adult life, making his way up the military hierarchy until the Emperor [[Gallienus]] made him the commander of his elite [[cavalry]] force (''hipparchos'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 90&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently his military deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Zozimus 1, 40, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 268 he found himself assigned as a  military tribune&lt;ref&gt;See SHA, ''Vita Claudii'', 14. It is in fact doubtful that Claudius was a military tribune at the time of Gallienus's murder. At that time this military tribune was usually the commander of a legionary [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] or an ''[[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]]'' of auxiliary cavalry. For Claudius to have been demoted to this level from the heights he had previous occupied (i.e. ''Hipparchos'' of the Cavalry and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Armies) would suggest a serious rift between himself and Gallienus. This is not impossible, but there is no evidence for it in any of the ancient sources - even Zozimus who is notably cool towards Claudius, gives no hint of it. The most likely explanation for the suggestion is that the author of the ''Historia Augusta'', writing in the Fourth Century AD after the Constantinian reform of the army, had no notion what the term 'tribune' denoted in the seventh decade of the previous century.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Imperial Army besieging the usurper [[Aureolus]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  His troops then proclaimed him Emperor&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;/&gt; amid charges, never proven, that he murdered his predecessor [[Gallienus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt; However, he soon proved to be less than bloodthirsty, as he asked the [[Roman Senate]] to spare the lives of [[Gallienus]]' family and supporters. He was less magnanimous toward Rome's enemies, however, and it was to this that he owed his popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible Claudius gained his position and the respect of the soldiers by being physically strong and especially cruel. A legend tells of Claudius knocking out a horse's teeth with one punch. When Claudius performed as a wrestler in the 250s, he supposedly knocked out the teeth of his opponent when his genitalia had been grabbed in the match.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius, like [[Maximinus Thrax]] before him, was of [[barbarian]] birth. After an interlude of failed [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Roman emperors since Maximinus' death, Claudius was the first in a series of tough soldier-emperors who would eventually restore the Empire from the [[Crisis of the third century]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 90&quot;/&gt;

===The Downfall of Gallienus===
[[File:Coin of Claudis II.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Antoninianus]] of Claudius II]]
During the 260s, the breakup of the [[Roman Empire]] into three distinct governing entities (the core Roman Empire, the [[Gallic Empire]] and the [[Palmyrene Empire]]) placed the whole Roman imperium into a precarious position. [[Gallienus]] was seriously weakened by his failure to defeat [[Postumus]] in the West, and the ability of [[Odaenathus]] to live with his arrangement with Gallienus in the East. By 268, however, the situation had changed, as [[Odaenathus]] was assassinated, most likely out of court intrigue, and Gallienus fell victim to a mutiny in his own ranks. Upon the death of Odaenathus, power fell to his younger son, who was dominated by his mother, [[Zenobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Under threat of invasion by multiple tribes, Gallienus' troubles primarily lay with [[Postumus]], whom he could not attack because his attention was required in dealing with [[Macrianus Major|Macrianus]] and the invading &quot;Skythai.&quot; After four years of delay, Postumus had established power, but in 265, when Gallienus and his men crossed the Alps, they defeated and besieged [[Postumus]] in an (unnamed) [[Gallic Empire|Gallic]] city. When victory appeared to be near, Gallienus made the mistake of approaching the city walls too closely and was gravely injured, compelling him to withdraw the campaign. In the next three years, Gallienus' troubles would only get worse. The &quot;Skythai&quot; successfully invaded the [[Balkans]] in the early months of 268, and [[Aureolus]], a commander of the cavalry, declared himself an ally of Postumus and the new emperor in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 263&quot;/&gt;

At this time, another invasion was taking place. A group called the Herulians navigated through [[Asia Minor]] and then into [[Greece]] on a naval expedition. Details of these invasions are abstract, as it is nearly impossible to reconstruct the happenings, due to the chain of conflicts initiated by the Herulians in 268. Scholars assume Gallienus' efforts were focused on Aureolus, the officer who betrayed him, and the defeat of the Herulians was left to his successor, Claudius Gothicus.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The death of Gallienus is surrounded by conspiracy and betrayal, as were many emperors' deaths. Different accounts of the incident are recorded, but they agree that senior officials wanted Gallienus dead. According to two accounts, the prime conspirator was [[Aurelius Heraclianus]], the [[Praetorian Prefect]]. One version of the story tells of Heraclianus bringing Claudius into the plot while the account given by [[Historia Augusta]] exculpates the would-be emperor and adds the prominent general [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]] into the plot. The removal of Claudius from the conspiracy is due to his later role as the progenitor of the house of [[Constantinian dynasty|Constantine]], a fiction of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s time, and may serve to guarantee that the original version from which these two accounts spring was current prior to the reign of Constantine. It is written that while sitting down at dinner, Gallienus was told that Aureolus and his men were approaching the camp. Gallienus rushed to the front lines, ready to give orders, when he was struck down by a commander of his cavalry. In a different and more controversial account, Aureolus forges a document in which Gallienus appears to be plotting against his generals and makes sure it falls into the hands of the emperor's senior staff. In this plot, [[Aurelian]] is added as a possible conspirator. The tale of his involvement in the conspiracy might be seen as at least partial justification for the murder of Aurelian himself under circumstances that seem remarkably similar to those in this story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 264&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever story is true, Gallienus was killed in the summer of 268, and Claudius was chosen by the army outside of [[Milan]] to succeed him. Accounts tell of people hearing the news of the new Emperor, and reacting by murdering Gallienus' family members until Claudius declared he would respect the memory of his predecessor. Claudius had the deceased emperor deified and buried in a family tomb on the [[Appian Way]]. The traitor [[Aureolus]] was not treated with the same reverence, as he was killed by his besiegers after a failed attempt to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 264&quot;/&gt;

===The Campaigns of Claudius===
At the time of his Claudius' accession, the [[Roman Empire]] was in serious danger from several incursions, both within and outside its borders. The most pressing of these was an invasion of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] by the [[Goths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;/&gt; Although [[Gallienus]] had already inflicted some damage on them at the Battle of Nestus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 109&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius, not long after being named Emperor, followed this up by winning his greatest victory, and one of the greatest in the history of Roman arms.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Map of Ancient Rome 271 AD.svg|thumb|right|400px|The Roman Empire in 268 A.D]]

At the [[Battle of Naissus]], Claudius and his legions routed a huge Gothic army.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;  Together with his [[cavalry]] commander, the future Emperor [[Aurelian]], the Romans took thousands of prisoners, destroyed the Gothic cavalry as a force, and stormed their [[laager]] (a circular alignment of wagons long favored by the Goths).{{dubious|date=July 2012}} The victory earned Claudius his surname of &quot;Gothicus&quot; (conqueror of the Goths),&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 90&quot;/&gt; and that is how he is known to this day. More importantly, the Goths were soon driven back across the [[Danube River]] by Aurelian, and nearly a century passed before they again posed a serious threat to the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the [[Alamanni]] had crossed the [[Alps]] and attacked the empire. Claudius responded quickly, routing the Alamanni at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in the late fall of 268, a few months after the battle of Naissus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 110&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; For this he was awarded the title of &quot;Germanicus Maximus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt; He then turned on the [[Gallic Empire]], ruled by a pretender for the past eight years and encompassing [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Gaul]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. He won several victories and soon regained control of [[Hispania]] and the Rhone river valley of Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 109&quot;/&gt;  This set the stage for the ultimate destruction of the Gallic Empire under Aurelian.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

However, Claudius did not live long enough to fulfill his goal of reuniting all the lost territories of the empire. Late in 269 he had traveled to [[Sirmium]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 209&quot;/&gt; and was preparing to go to war against the [[Vandals]], who were raiding in [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 110&quot;/&gt; However, he fell victim to the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (possibly [[smallpox]]), and died early in January 270.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Now when the war with the Goths was finished, there spread abroad a most grievous pestilence, and then Claudius himself was stricken by the disease, and, leaving mankind, he departed to heaven, an abode befitting his virtues.&quot; (''[[Historia Augusta]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, he is thought to have named Aurelian as his successor, though Claudius' brother [[Quintillus]] briefly seized power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 11&quot;/&gt;

The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] immediately deified Claudius as &quot;Divus Claudius Gothicus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193-337'', pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Empire and Foreign Affairs Under Claudius===
Claudius was not the only man to reap the benefits of holding high office after the death of [[Gallienus]]. Before the rule of Claudius Gothicus, there had only been two emperors from the [[Balkans]], but afterwards there would only be one emperor who did not hail from the provinces of [[Pannonia]], [[Moesia]] or [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] until the year 378, when [[Theodosius I]] from [[Hispania]] would take the throne. To comprehend the structure of government during the reign of Claudius, we must look at four inscriptions that deepen our understanding of a new, truncated empire. The first is a dedication to [[Aurelius Heraclianus]], the prefect involved in the conspiracy against Gallienus, from Traianus Mucianus, who also gave a dedication to [[Heraclianus]]' brother, Aurelius Appollinaris, who was the equestrian governor of the province of ''[[Thracia]]'' in 267-68 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christol|first=Michel|title=Une carrière équestre sous le règne de l'empereur Gallien|journal=Latomus|year=1976|volume=35|pages=866–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these men shared the family name, Marcus Aurelius, a name given to those made citizens by the [[constitutio Antoniniana]], we can understand that these men did not come from the imperial ''élite''. The third inscription reveals the career of [[Marcianus]], another leading general by the time that Gallienus died. The fourth honors Julius Placidianus, the prefect of the [[vigiles]]. While we cannot prove that Heraclianus, Appollinaris, [[Placidianus]], or Marcianus were of [[Danubian]] origin themselves, it is clear that none of them were members of the [[Severan]] aristocracy, and all of them appear to owe their prominence to their military roles.  To these men must be added Marcus Aurelius Aurelianus (the future emperor [[Aurelian]]) and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus]] (another emperor in waiting), both men of Balkan background, and from families enfranchised in the time of [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 265&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Although we see a rise in Pannonian, Moesian and Illyrian marshals, and foreigners become notable figures, it would be impractical to think the government could function without help from the traditional classes within the empire.  Although their influence was weakened, there were still a number of men with influence from the older [[aristocracy]]. Claudius assumed the consulship in 269 with Paternus, a member of the prominent senatorial family, the Paterni, who had supplied consuls and urban prefects throughout Gallienus' reign, and thus were quite influential. In addition, [[Flavius Antiochianus]], one of the consuls of 270, who was an urban prefect the year before, would continue to hold his office for the following year. A colleague of Antiochianus, Virius Orfitus, also the descendant of a powerful family, would continue to hold influence during his father's term as prefect. Aurelian's colleague as consul was another such man, Pomponius Bassus, a member of one of the oldest senatorial families, as was one of the consuls in 272, Junius Veldumnianus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 265&quot;/&gt;

In his first full year of power, Claudius was greatly assisted by the sudden destruction of the imperium Galliarum. When Ulpius Cornelius Laelianus, a high official under [[Postumus]], declared himself emperor in [[Germania Superior]], in the spring of 269, [[Postumus]] defeated him, but in doing so, refused to allow the sack of [[Mainz]], which had served as [[Laelianus]]' headquarters. This proved to be his downfall, for out of anger, Postumus' army mutinied and murdered him. Selected by the troops, [[Marcus Aurelius Marius]] was to replace Postumus as ruler. Marius' rule did not last long though, as [[Victorinus]], Postumus' praetorian prefect, defeated him. Now emperor of the [[Gaul]]s, Victorinus was soon in a precarious position, for the Spanish provinces had deserted the [[Gallic Empire]] and declared their loyalty to Claudius, while in southern [[France]], [[Placidianus]] had captured [[Grenoble]]. Luckily, it was there that Placidianus stopped and Victorinus' position stabilized. In the next year, when [[Autun]] revolted, declaring itself for Claudius, the central government made no moves to support it. As a result, the city went through a siege, lasting many weeks, until it was finally captured and sacked by Victorinus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 266&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still unknown why Claudius did nothing to help the city of [[Autun]], but sources tell us his relations with [[Palmyra]] were waning in the course of 270. An obscure passage in the [[Historia Augusta]] life of Gallienus states that he had sent an army under [[Aurelius Heraclianus]] to the region that had been annihilated by [[Zenobia]]. But because Heraclianus was not actually in the east in 268 (instead, at this time, he was involved in the conspiracy of Gallienus' death), we can see that this can not be correct. But the confusion evident in this passage, which also places the bulk of &quot;Skythian&quot; activity during 269 a year earlier, under Gallienus, may stem from a later effort to pile all possible disasters in this year into the reign of the former Emperor. This would keep Claudius' record of being an ancestor of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] from being tainted. If this understanding of the sources is correct, it might also be correct to see the expedition of Heraclianus to the east as an event of Claudius' time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 266&quot;/&gt;

The victories of Claudius over the [[Goths]] would not only make him a hero in [[Latin]] tradition, but an admirable choice as an ancestor for [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who was born at [[Naissus]], the site of Claudius' victory in 269. Claudius is also held in high esteem by [[Zonaras]], whose [[Greeks|Greek]] tradition seems to have been influenced by [[Latin]]. For [[Zosimus]], a more reasoned contemporary view shows him as less grand. Claudius' successes in the year 269 were not continued in his next year as Emperor. As the &quot;Skythai&quot; starved in the mountains or surrendered, the legions pursuing them began to see an epidemic spreading throughout the men. Also, Claudius' unwillingness to do anything at the siege of [[Autun]] likely provoked a quarrel with [[Zenobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is not proven that the invasion of [[Gaul]] was the breaking point between Claudius and Zenobia, the sequence of events point to the siege as an important factor. The issue at hand was the position that [[Odaenathus]] held as corrector totius orientis. [[Vaballathus]], the son of Zenobia, was given this title when Zenobia claimed it for him. From then on, tension between the two empires would only get worse. [[Aurelius Heraclianus]]' fabled arrival might have been an effort to reassert central control after the death of Odaenathus, but, if so, it failed. Although coins were never minted with the face of Odaenathus, soon after his death coins were made with image of his son.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Under [[Zabdas]], a [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrene]] army invaded [[Arabia]] and moved into [[Egypt]] in the late summer. At this time, the prefect of Egypt was Tenagino Probus, described as an able soldier who not only defeated an invasion of [[Cyrenaica]] by the nomadic tribes to the south in 269, but also was successful in hunting down &quot;Skythian&quot; ships in the [[Mediterranean]]. However, he did not see the same success in Egypt, for a Palmyrene underground, led by [[Timagenes]], undermined Probus, defeated his army, and killed him in a battle near the modern city of [[Cairo]] in the late summer of 270.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;/&gt;

Generally when a Roman commander is slaughtered it is taken as a sign that a state of war is in existence, and if we can associate the death of [[Heraclianus]] in 270, as well as an inscription from [[Bostra]] recording the rebuilding of a temple destroyed by the Palmyrene army, then these violent acts could be interpreted the same way. Yet they apparently were not. As David Potter writes, &quot;The coins of [[Vaballathus]] avoid claims to imperial power: he remains vir consularis, rex, imperator, dux Romanorum, a range of titles that did not mimic those of the central government.  The status vir consularis was, as we have seen, conferred upon [[Odaenathus]]; the title rex, or king, is simply a [[Latin]] translation of mlk, or king; imperator in this context simply means &quot;victorious general&quot;; and dux Romanorum looks like yet another version of corrector totius orientis&quot; (Potter, 263). These titles suggest that Odaenathus' position, not unlike a king in the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] world, was inheritable. In Roman culture, the status gained in procuring a position could be passed on, but not the position itself. It is possible that the thin line between office and the status that accompanied it were dismissed in Palmyrene court, especially when the circumstance worked against the interests of a regime that was able to defeat [[Persia]], which a number of Roman emperors had failed to do.  Vaballathus stressed the meanings of titles, because in Palmyrene context, the titles of Odaenathus meant a great deal. When the summer of 270 ended, things were looking very different in the empire than they did a year before. After its success, [[Gaul]] was in a state of inactivity and the empire was failing in the east. Insufficient resources plagued the state, as a great deal of silver was used for the [[antoninianus]], which was again diluted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 267&quot;/&gt;

==Religion==
An account written by Aurelius Victor states that Claudius consulted the [[Sibylline Books]] prior to his campaigns against the [[Goths]]. Hinting that Claudius &quot;revived the tradition of the Decii&quot;,
Victor illustrates the senatorial view, which saw Claudius' predecessor, [[Gallienus]], as too relaxed when it came to religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to Constantinian dynasty==
The unreliable ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia,  who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to [[Constantius Chlorus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Claudius, 13:2&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians suspect this account to be a [[genealogical]] fabrication, however, intended to link the family of [[Constantine I]] to that of a well-respected emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

==Saint Valentine==
Claudius Gothicus has been linked to [[Saint Valentine]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Contemporary records of his deeds were most probably destroyed during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] on early 4th century&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; and a tale of martydom was recorded in ''Passio Marii et Marthae'', a work published in the 5th or 6th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; 20th-century historians agree that the accounts from this period are not able to be verified.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;&gt;Jack Oruch, &quot;St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February&quot;, ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp 534–565) p 535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; The legend refers to &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot; but [[Claudius I]] did not make any persecution against Christians, so people believe him to be Claudius II even although this emperor spent most of his time warring outside of his territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; The legend was retold in later texts. In the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of 1493 AD, the emperor martyred the Roman priest during a general persecution of Christians. The text states that St. Valentine was beaten with clubs and finally beheaded for giving aid to [[Christians]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of 1260 AD recounts how St. Valentine refused to deny Christ before the &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot; in 270 AD and as a result was beheaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;&gt;Henry Kelly, ''Chaucer and the cult of Saint Valentine'', pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, February 14 marks [[Valentine's Day]], a day set aside by the Christian church in memory of the Roman priest and physician.&lt;ref&gt;Larue, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quintillus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Claudius Quintillus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Quintillus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS CLAVDIVS QVINTILLVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 759&lt;/ref&gt; c. 212 – April 270), was [[Roman Emperor]] for a few months in 270.

==Early life and election as Emperor==
Quintillus was born at [[Sirmium]] in [[Pannonia Inferior]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;These men are usually called the Illyrian emperors since they all were born in that province (Illyricum) and were raised to power by legions stationed there.&quot; The Ancient World, Joseph Ward Swain&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from a low-born family, Quintillus came to prominence with the accession of his brother [[Claudius II Gothicus]] to the imperial throne in 268. Quintillus was possibly made [[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]] of [[Sardinia]] during his brother’s reign.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; He was declared emperor either by the Senate or by his brother’s soldiers upon the latter's death in 270.

[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] reports Quintillus to have been elected by soldiers of the [[Roman army]] immediately following the death of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius IX:12&lt;/ref&gt; The choice was reportedly approved by the [[Roman Senate]]. [[Joannes Zonaras]] reports him elected by the Senate itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zonaras&quot;&gt;Zonaras, 12:26&lt;/ref&gt;  Records however agree that the [[Roman legion|legions]] which had followed Claudius in campaigning along the [[Danube]] were either unaware or disapproving of Quintillus' elevation. They instead elevated their current leader [[Aurelian]] as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign of Quintillus==
The few records of Quintillus' reign are contradictory. They disagree on the length of his reign, variously reported to have lasted as few as 17 days and as many as 177 days (about six months).&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Records also disagree on the cause of his death. ''Historia Augusta'' reports him [[murder]]ed by his own soldiers in reaction to his strict  [[military discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Claudius'', 12:5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jerome]] reports him killed, presumably in conflict with Aurelian.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, Chronica s.a. 271&lt;/ref&gt; [[John of Antioch]] and Joannes Zonaras reported Quintillus to have committed [[suicide]] by opening his [[vein]]s and bleeding himself to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zonaras&quot;/&gt;  John reports the suicide to have been assisted by a [[physician]].&lt;ref&gt;John of Antioch, fr. 154 FHG IV, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Salmasius]] pointed that [[Dexippus]] recorded the death without stating causes.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, Claudius, 12:6&lt;/ref&gt; All records however agree in placing the death at [[Aquileia]].

Quintillus was reportedly survived by his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Claudius'', 13:9&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Augusta'' reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia, who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to [[Constantius Chlorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Claudius'', 13:1&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians however suspect this account to be a [[genealogical]] [[Lie#Fabrication|fabrication]] to flatter [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Banchich&quot;&gt;Banchich, www.roman-emperors.org/quintil.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving Roman records considered Quintillus a moderate and capable Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;See Eutropius, IX:12&lt;/ref&gt;  He was seen as a champion of the Senate and thus compared to previous Emperors [[Servius Sulpicius Galba]] and [[Publius Helvius Pertinax]]. All three were highly regarded by Senatorial sources despite their failure to survive a full year of reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banchich&quot;/&gt;

'''Aurelian''' ({{lang-la|Lucius Domitius Aurelianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Aurelian's name would be inscribed as LVCIVS DOMITIVS AVRELIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His full name, with honorific and [[victory title]]s, was ''Imperator Caesar Lucius Domitius Aurelianus Augustus, Germanicus Maximus, Gothicus Maximus, Parthicus Maximus, Restitutor Orientis, Restitutor Orbis''.&lt;/ref&gt; 9 September 214 or 215 – September or October 275), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 270 to 275. Born in humble circumstances, he rose through the military ranks to become emperor. During his reign, he defeated the [[Alamanni]] after a devastating war. He also defeated the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]]. Aurelian restored the Empire's eastern provinces after his conquest of the [[Palmyrene Empire]] in 273. The following year he conquered the [[Gallic Empire]] in the west, reuniting the Empire in its entirety. He was also responsible for the construction of the [[Aurelian Walls]] in [[Rome]], and the abandonment of the province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]].

His successes were instrumental in ending the Roman Empire's [[Crisis of the Third Century]], earning him the title ''Restitutor Orbis'' or 'Restorer of the World'. Although [[Domitian]] was the first emperor who had demanded to be officially hailed as ''dominus et deus'' (master and god), these titles never occurred in written form on official documents until the reign of Aurelian.&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Halsberghe, ''The Cult of Sol Invictus'', Leiden, 1972, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA152 152].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Aurelian was born on 9 September, most likely in 214 AD, although 215 AD is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders(1992:104-6)&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources are not agreed on his place of birth, although he was generally accepted as being a native of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Sirmium in [[Pannonia Inferior]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]) is the preferred location,&lt;ref&gt;Milošević(2010:pp 106-7)&lt;/ref&gt; which was created by Aurelian as Emperor when he abandoned the old trans-Danubian territory of [[Dacia]]. The academic consensus is that he was of humble birth and that his father was a peasant-farmer who took his Roman ''[[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]]'' from his landlord, a senator of the clan Aurelius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson1999:1&quot;&gt;Watson(1999:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders suggests that his family might in fact have been of Roman settler origin and of much higher social status, however, his suggestion has not been taken up by his more recent academic colleagues such as Southern and Watson.

Using the evidence of the ancient sources, it was at one time suggested that Aurelian's mother was a [[freedwoman]] of a member of the clan Aurelius and that she herself was a priestess of the [[Sol Invictus|Sun-God]] in her native village. These two propositions together with the tradition that the clan Aurelius had been entrusted with the maintenance of that deity's cult in Rome inspired the notion that this could explain the devotion to the sun-god that Aurelian was to manifest as Emperor - see below. However, it seems that this pleasant extrapolation of dubious facts is now generally accepted as being no more than just that.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders(1992:107).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
It is commonly accepted that Aurelian probably joined the army in 235 AD at around age twenty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson1999:1&quot;/&gt; It is also generally assumed that, as a member of the lowest rank of society - albeit a citizen&lt;ref&gt;Had Aurelian's family been enfranchised by virtue of the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' (212 AD) his ''nomen'' would have been &quot;Aurelius&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; - he would have enlisted in the ranks of the legions. Idiosyncratically, Saunders suggests that his career is more easily understood if it is assumed that his family was of Roman settler origins with a tradition of military service and that he enlisted as an equestrian.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders(1992:109).&lt;/ref&gt; This would have opened up for him the ''tres militia'' - the three steps of the equestrian military career - one of the routes to higher equestrian office in the Imperial Service.&lt;ref&gt;The ''tres militia'' were: (I) prefecture of a cohort of auxiliary infantry; (ii) tribunate of a legionary cohort; and (iii) prefecture of an ''ala'' of auxiliary cavalry.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a more expeditious route to senior military and [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]]ial offices than that pursued by ex-rankers, although not necessarily less laborious.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the career of [[Pertinax]] who pursued the ''Tres Militia'' with those of [[Publius Aelius Aelianus]], [[Lucius Aurelius Marcianus]] (both probably) and [[Traianus Mucianus]] (certainly) who rose ''e caliga'' - i.e. through the ranks.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Saunders's conjecture as to Aurelian's early career is not supported by any evidence other than his ''nomen'' which could indicate Italian settler ancestry - although even this is contested - and his rise to the highest ranks which is more easily understood if he did not have to start from the bottom. His suggestion has not been taken up by other academic authorities.

Whatever his origins, Aurelian certainly must have built up a very solid reputation for military competence during the tumultuous mid-decades of the century. To be sure, the exploits detailed in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' ''vita Divi Aureliani'', while not always impossible, are not supported by any independent evidence and one at least is demonstrably an invention typical of that author.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''vita Divi Aureliani'' paras 5.5-6, 6.3-5, and 7.1-2. If he ever was a tribune of a legion as suggested in 7.1-2 it could not have been with ''Legio VII Gallicana'' as that unit never existed.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was probably associated with Gallienus's cavalry army and shone as an officer of that ''corps d'élite'' because, when he finally emerged in a historically reliable context in the early part of the reign of [[Claudius II]], he seems to have been its commander.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders(1992:129-130).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service under Gallienus===
His successes as a cavalry commander ultimately made him a member of emperor [[Gallienus]]' entourage. In 268, Aurelian and his cavalry participated in general [[Claudius II|Claudius]]' victory over the [[Goths]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year Gallienus traveled to Italy and fought [[Aureolus]], his former general and now usurper for the throne. Driving Aureolus back into [[Milan|Mediolanum]], Gallienus promptly besieged his adversary in the city. However, while the siege was ongoing the Emperor was assassinated. One source says Aurelian, who was present at the siege, participated and supported general Claudius for the purple – which is plausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], xxxiii,21. Other sources do not cite Aurelian among those who conjured against Gallienus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurelian was married to [[Ulpia Severina]], about whom little is known. Like Aurelian she was from [[Dacia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;watson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last =Watson |first =Alaric|authorlink = |coauthors = |title =Aurelian and the Third Century |publisher =Routledge|year =1999 |location = London|pages = |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-415-07248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to have had a daughter together.&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.roman-emperors.org/aurelian.htm|title= Aurelian (A.D. 270–275)|last1= Körner|first1= Christian|last2= |first2= |date= 23 December 2008 |work= De Imperatoribus Romanis: An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Rulers and Their Families|publisher= |accessdate=6 January 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202042214/http://www.roman-emperors.org/aurelian.htm|archivedate= 2 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service under Claudius ===
Claudius was acclaimed Emperor by the soldiers outside Mediolanum. The new Emperor immediately ordered the senate to deify Gallienus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 42&quot;&gt;Watson, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he began to distance himself from those responsible for his predecessor's assassination, ordering the execution of those directly involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 42&quot;/&gt; Aureolus was still besieged in Mediolanum and sought reconciliation with the new emperor, but Claudius had no sympathy for a potential rival. The emperor had Aureolus killed and one source implicates Aurelian in the deed, perhaps even signing the warrant for his death himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 42&quot;/&gt;

During the reign of Claudius, Aurelian was promoted rapidly: he was given command of the elite Dalmatian cavalry, and was soon promoted to overall ''[[Magister equitum]]'', effectively the head of the army after the Emperor – the Emperor's position before his acclamation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 42&quot;/&gt; The war against Aureolus and the concentration of forces in Italy allowed the [[Alamanni]] to break through the [[Limes Germanicus|Rhaetian limes]] along the upper [[Danube]]. Marching through [[Raetia]] and the [[Alps]] unhindered, they entered northern Italy and began pillaging the area. In early 269, emperor Claudius and Aurelian marched north to meet the Alamanni, defeating them decisively at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 43&quot;&gt;Watson, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

While still dealing with the defeated enemy, news came from the [[Balkans]] reporting large-scale attacks from the [[Heruli]], [[Goths]], [[Gepids]], and [[Bastarnae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 43&quot;/&gt; Claudius immediately dispatched Aurelian to the Balkans to contain the invasion as best he could until Claudius could arrive with his main army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 44&quot;&gt;Watson, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Goths were besieging [[Thessalonica]] when they heard of emperor Claudius' approach, causing them to abandon the siege and pillage north-eastern Macedonia. Aurelian intercepted the Goths with his Dalmatian cavalry and defeated them in a series of minor skirmishes, killing as many as three thousand of the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 44&quot;/&gt; Aurelian continued to harass the enemy, driving them northward into [[Upper Moesia]] where emperor Claudius had assembled his main army. The ensuing battle was indecisive: the northward advance of the Goths was halted but Roman losses were heavy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 44&quot;/&gt;

Claudius could not afford another pitched battle, so he instead laid a successful ambush, killing thousands. However, the majority of the Goths escaped and began retreating south the way they had come. For the rest of year, Aurelian harassed the enemy with his Dalmatian cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 45&quot;&gt;Watson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Now stranded in Roman territory, the Goths' lack of provisions began to take its toll. Aurelian, sensing his enemies' desperation, attacked them with the full force of his cavalry, killing many and driving the remainder westward into [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 45&quot;/&gt; As winter set in, the Goths retreated into the [[Haemus Mons|Haemus Mountains]], only to find themselves trapped and surrounded. The harsh conditions now exacerbated their shortage of food. However, the Romans underestimated the Goths and let their guard down, allowing the enemy to break through their lines and escape. Apparently emperor Claudius ignored advice, perhaps from Aurelian, and withheld the cavalry and sent in only the infantry to stop their break-out.

The determined Goths killed many of the oncoming infantry and were only prevented from slaughtering them all when Aurelian finally charged in with his Dalmatian cavalry. The Goths still managed to escape and continued their march through Thrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 45&quot;/&gt; The Roman army continued to follow the Goths during the spring and summer of 270. Meanwhile, a devastating plague swept through the Balkans, killing many soldiers in both armies.

Emperor Claudius fell ill on the march to the battle and returned to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 45&quot;/&gt; Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were easier to deal with. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, p. 45&quot;/&gt; Aurelian had no time to relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Quintillus===
When Claudius died, his brother [[Quintillus]] seized power with support of the Senate. With an act typical of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the army refused to recognize the new Emperor, preferring to support one of its own commanders: Aurelian was proclaimed emperor in September 270 by the [[Roman legion|legion]]s in Sirmium. Aurelian defeated Quintillus' troops, and was recognized as Emperor by the Senate after Quintillus' death. The claim that Aurelian was chosen by Claudius on his death bed&lt;ref name=zonaras&gt;Zonaras.&lt;/ref&gt; can be dismissed as propaganda; later, probably in 272, Aurelian put his own ''dies imperii'' the day of Claudius' death, thus implicitly considering Quintillus a [[roman usurper|usurper]].&lt;ref name=korner&gt;Korner.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his base of power secure, he now turned his attention to Rome's greatest problems — recovering the vast territories lost over the previous two decades, and reforming the ''res publica''.

==Emperor==

===The Roman Empire in the 270s===
[[Image:Aureliancoin1.jpg|thumb|right|Aurelian was a military commander, and during his reign he tried to keep legions' fidelity; this coin celebrated the CONCORDIA MILITVM, &quot;concord of the soldiers&quot; – in other words, &quot;harmony between the emperor and the military&quot;.]]

In 248, Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] had celebrated the millennium of the city of Rome with great and expensive ceremonies and games, and the Empire had given a tremendous proof of self-confidence. In the following years, however, the Empire had to face a huge pressure from external enemies, while, at the same time, dangerous civil wars threatened the empire from within, with usurpers weakening the strength of the state. Also, the economical substrate of the state, agriculture and commerce, suffered from the disruption caused by the instability. On top of this an epidemic swept through the Empire around 250, greatly diminishing manpower both for the army and for agriculture.

The end result was that the Empire could not endure the blow of the capture of Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] in 260. The eastern provinces found their protectors in the rulers of the city of [[Palmyra]], in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], whose autonomy grew until the formation of the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which was more successful against the Persian threat. The western provinces, those facing the ''[[limes]]'' of the [[Rhine]], seceded to form a third, autonomous state within the territories of the Roman Empire, which is now known as the [[Gallic Empire]].

In Rome, the Emperor was occupied with the internal menaces to his power and with the defense of [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and the Balkans. This was the situation faced by Gallienus and Claudius, and the problems Aurelian had to deal with at the beginning of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reunification of the empire===
The first actions of the new Emperor were aimed at strengthening his own position in his territories. Late in 270, Aurelian campaigned in northern [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] against the [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], and [[Sarmatians]], expelling them from Roman territory. To celebrate these victories, Aurelian was granted the  title of ''Germanicus Maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1,48f.; Eutropius; [[Dexippus]], FGrH IIA 460 F7; ''Historia Augusta – Aurelianus'' xxi,1–3 and xviii,2.&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the Emperor was challenged by several [[roman usurper|usurpers]] — [[Septimius (Roman emperor usurper)|Septimius]], [[Urbanus (Roman usurper)|Urbanus]], [[Domitianus]], and the rebellion of [[Felicissimus]] — who tried to exploit the sense of insecurity of the empire and the overwhelming influence of the armies in Roman politics. Aurelian, being an experienced commander, was aware of the importance of the army, and his propaganda, known through his coinage, shows he wanted the support of the legions.&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

====Defending Italy Against the Iuthungi====
[[Image:Porta Asinaria 2948.JPG|right|thumb|The ''Porta Asinara'', a gate in the [[Aurelian Walls]].]]
The burden of the northern barbarians was not yet over, however. In 271, the [[Alamanni]] moved towards Italia, entering the Po plain and sacking the villages; they passed the [[Po River]], occupied [[Piacenza|Placentia]] and moved towards [[Fano]]. Aurelian, who was in Pannonia to control the [[Vandals]]' withdrawal, quickly entered Italia, but his army was defeated in an [[Battle of Placentia (271)|ambush near Placentia]] (January 271). When the news of the defeat arrived in Rome, it caused great fear for the arrival of the barbarians. But Aurelian attacked the Alamanni camping near the [[Metauro|Metaurus River]], defeating them in the [[Battle of Fano]], and forcing them to re-cross the Po river; Aurelian finally routed them at  [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Pavia]]. For this, he received the title ''Germanicus Maximus''. However, the menace of the Germanic people remained high as perceived by the Romans, so Aurelian resolved to build the walls that became known as the [[Aurelian Walls]] around [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 51–54, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defeat of the Goths and abandonment of Dacia====
The emperor led his legions to the Balkans, where he defeated and routed the Goths beyond the Danube, killing the Gothic leader [[Cannabaudes]], and assuming the title of ''Gothicus Maximus''. However, he decided to abandon the province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], on the exposed north bank of the Danube, as too difficult and expensive to defend. He reorganized a new province of Dacia south of the Danube, inside the former [[Moesia]], called ''[[Dacia Aureliana]]'', with [[Serdica]] as the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquest of the Palmyrene Empire====

In 272, Aurelian turned his attention to the lost eastern provinces of the empire, the so-called &quot;[[Palmyrene Empire]]&quot; ruled by Queen [[Zenobia]] from the city of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref&gt;The war against the Palmyrene Empire is described in Zosimus, 1,50,1–1,61,1, and ''Historia Augusta'', ''Aurelianus'', 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zenobia had carved out her own empire, encompassing [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Egypt]] and large parts of [[Asia Minor]]. The Syrian queen cut off Rome's shipments of grain, and in a matter of weeks, the Romans started running low on bread. In the beginning, Aurelian had been recognized as Emperor, while [[Vaballathus]], the son of Zenobia, held the title of ''rex'' and ''imperator'' (&quot;king&quot; and &quot;supreme military commander&quot;), but Aurelian decided to invade the eastern provinces as soon as he felt his army to be strong enough.

Asia Minor was recovered easily; every city but [[Byzantium]] and [[Tyana]] surrendered to him with little resistance. The fall of Tyana lent itself to a legend: Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he spared Tyana after having a vision of the great 1st-century philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]], whom he respected greatly, in a dream.

Apollonius implored him, stating, &quot;Aurelian, if you desire to rule, abstain from the blood of the innocent! Aurelian, if you will conquer, be merciful!&quot; Whatever the reason, Aurelian spared Tyana. It paid off; many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the Emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Within six months, his armies stood at the gates of Palmyra, which surrendered when Zenobia tried to flee to the [[Sassanid Empire]]. The &quot;Palmyrene Empire&quot; was no more.

Eventually Zenobia and her son were captured and made to walk on the streets of Rome in his triumph. With the grain stores once again shipped to Rome, Aurelian's soldiers handed out free bread to the citizens of the city, and the Emperor was hailed a hero by his subjects. After a brief clash with the Persians and another in Egypt against the usurper [[Firmus]], Aurelian was obliged to return to Palmyra in 273 when that city rebelled once more. This time, Aurelian allowed his soldiers to sack the city, and Palmyra never recovered. More honors came his way; he was now known as ''Parthicus Maximus'' and ''Restitutor Orientis'' (&quot;Restorer of the East&quot;).&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

The rich province of Egypt was also recovered by Aurelian. The Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in Alexandria was burned to the ground. This section of the city once contained the [[Library of Alexandria]], although it is not known if the Library still existed in Aurelian's time. (It had already been damaged by fire during the visit of [[Julius Caesar]] to Alexandria.)

====Conquest of the Gallic Empire====
In 274, the victorious emperor turned his attention to the west, and the &quot;[[Gallic Empire]]&quot; which had already been reduced in size by Claudius II. Aurelian won this campaign largely through diplomacy; the &quot;Gallic Emperor&quot; [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]] was willing to abandon his throne and allow Gaul and Britain to return to the Empire, but could not openly submit to Aurelian. Instead, the two seem to have conspired so that when the armies met at [[Châlons-en-Champagne]] that autumn, Tetricus simply deserted to the Roman camp and Aurelian easily defeated the Gallic army facing him.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Tetricus was rewarded for his part in the conspiracy with a high-ranking position in Italy itself.

Aurelian returned to Rome and won his last honorific from the Senate – ''Restitutor Orbis'' (&quot;Restorer of the World&quot;). This title was first assumed by Aurelian in late summer of 272, and had been carried previously by both Valerian and Gallienus.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In four years, Aurelian had secured the frontiers of the Empire and reunified it, effectively giving the Empire a new lease on life that lasted 200 years.

===Reforms===
Aurelian was a reformer, and settled many important functions of the imperial apparatus, dealing with the economy and religion. He restored many public buildings, re-organized the management of the food reserves, set fixed prices for the most important goods, and prosecuted misconduct by the public officers.

====Religious reform====
Aurelian strengthened the position of the Sun god [[Sol Invictus]] as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon. His intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. The center of the cult was [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|a new temple]], built in 274 in the ''[[Campus Agrippae]]'' in Rome, with great decorations financed by the spoils of the Palmyrene Empire.

During his short rule, Aurelian seemed to follow the principle of &quot;one faith, one empire&quot;, which would not be made official until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]]. He appears with the title ''deus et dominus natus'' (&quot;God and born ruler&quot;) on some of his coins, a style also later adopted by Diocletian. [[Lactantius]] argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time. He was recorded by Christian historians as having organized persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', B &amp; C Texts.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Felicissimus' rebellion and coinage reform====
Aurelian's reign records the only uprising of mint workers. The ''[[rationalis]]'' [[Felicissimus]], a senior public financial official whose responsibilities included supervision of the mint at Rome, revolted against Aurelian. The revolt seems to have been caused by the fact that the mint workers, and Felicissimus first, were accustomed to stealing the silver for the coins and producing coins of inferior quality. Aurelian wanted to eliminate this, and put Felicissimus on trial. The ''rationalis'' incited the mintworkers to revolt: the rebellion spread in the streets, even if it seems that Felicissimus was killed immediately, presumably executed.

The Palmyrene rebellion in Egypt had probably reduced the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]], thus disaffecting the population to the emperor. This rebellion also had the support of some senators, probably those who had supported the election of [[Quintillus]], and thus had something to fear from Aurelian.

Aurelian ordered the urban cohorts, reinforced by some regular troops of the imperial army, to attack the rebelling mob: the resulting battle, fought on the [[Caelian hill]], marked the end of the revolt, even if at a high price (some sources give the figure, probably exaggerated, of 7,000 casualties). Many of the rebels were executed; also some of the supporting senators were put to death. The mint of Rome was closed temporarily, and the institution of several other mints caused the main mint of the empire to lose its hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

His monetary reformation included the introduction of ''[[antoninianus|antoniniani]]'' containing 5% silver. They bore the mark &lt;small&gt;XXI&lt;/small&gt; (or its Greek numerals form &lt;small&gt;KA&lt;/small&gt;), which meant that twenty of such coins would contain the same silver quantity of an old silver ''[[denarius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 130. Later emperors [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]] and [[Carus]] would mint coins with the legends XI or IA, signalling a 10% of silver in the alloy.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that this was an improvement over the previous situation gives an idea of the severity of the economic situation Aurelian faced. The Emperor struggled to introduce the new &quot;good&quot; coin by recalling all the old &quot;bad&quot; coins prior to their introduction.&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

== Death ==

Holder of the title of ''mater castrorum et senatus et patriae'', typical of the women of the [[Severan dynasty]]. Severina possibly ruled alone between Aurelian's death and Tacitus' election, thus being the only Roman Empress ruling in her own right.]]

In 275, Aurelian marched towards Asia Minor, preparing another campaign against the Sassanids: the deaths of Kings [[Shapur I]] (272) and [[Hormizd I]] (273) in quick succession, and the rise to power of a weakened ruler ([[Bahram I]]), set the possibility to attack the Sassanid Empire.

On his way, the Emperor suppressed a revolt in Gaul — possibly against Faustinus, an officer or usurper of Tetricus — and defeated barbarian marauders in [[Vindelicia]] (Germany).

However, Aurelian never reached Persia, as he was murdered while waiting in Thrace to cross into Asia Minor. As an administrator, Aurelian had been very strict and handed out severe punishments to corrupt officials or soldiers. A secretary of Aurelian (called Eros by [[Zosimus]]) had told a lie on a minor issue. In fear of what the Emperor might do, he forged a document listing the names of high officials marked by the emperor for execution, and showed it to collaborators. The ''notarius'' Mucapor and other high-ranking officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], fearing punishment from the Emperor, murdered him in September 275, in [[Caenophrurium]], Thrace (modern Turkey).

Aurelian's enemies in the Senate briefly succeeded in passing ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on the Emperor, but this was reversed before the end of the year and Aurelian, like his predecessor Claudius II, was deified as ''Divus Aurelianus''.

There is substantial evidence that Aurelian's wife [[Ulpia Severina]], who had been declared ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' in 274, may have ruled the Empire by her own power for some time after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;watson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=re/&gt; The sources indicate that there was an [[interregnum]] between Aurelian's death and the election of [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] as his successor. Additionally, some of Ulpia's coins appear to have been minted after Aurelian's death.&lt;ref name=re/&gt;

Aurelian's short reign reunited a fragmented Empire while saving Rome from barbarian invasions that had reached Italy itself. His death prevented a full restoration of political stability and a lasting dynasty that could end the cycle of assassination of Emperors and civil war that marked this period. Even so, he brought the Empire through a very critical period in its history, and without Aurelian it never would have survived the invasions and fragmentation of the decade in which he reigned. Much hard fighting remained for his successors before the Empire finally regained the initiative against the [[Persian people|Persians]] and the northern barbarian peoples and it would be another twenty years or more before [[Diocletian]] fully restored stability and ended the [[Crisis of the third century]]. However, after that the Western half of the Empire would survive another two hundred years, while the East would last another millennium and for that Aurelian must be allowed much of the credit.

The city of [[Orléans]] in France is named after Aurelian. Originally named [[Cenabum]], Aurelian rebuilt and named it ''Aurelianum'' or ''Aureliana Civitas'' (&quot;city of Aurelian&quot;, ''cité d'Aurélien''), which evolved into ''Orléans''. The city of [[New Orleans]] (in French, ''La Nouvelle-Orléans''), in [[Louisiana]], [[United States]] is named after the commune of Orléans, and therefore by extension, Aurelian.
&lt;ref&gt;For an exact etymology, see ''Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orléans'' de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domitianus''' was probably a Roman soldier of the mid-third century AD who was acclaimed [[Roman emperor|emperor]], probably in northern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in late 270 or early 271 AD, and struck coins to advertise his elevation. It is now generally assumed that this man is to be equated with the ‘Domitianus’ who is twice mentioned in the literary sources as a significant figure in the politics of the age, but on neither occasion as an outright contender for the Imperial throne.

Given that his reign lasted for, at best, only a few weeks after his acclamation and he does not seem to have secured significant military or political support Domitianus is more properly categorized as a [[Roman usurper]] rather than an emperor. His attempted ‘’coup’’ should also be understood in the context of the troubled later history of the ‘[[Gallic Empire]]’ rather than that of the Empire as a whole.

==Numismatic evidence==
The only evidence for the existence and rule of an Imperial claimant named Domitianus derives from two coins. The first was part of a hoard discovered at Les Cléons, in the commune of [[Haute-Goulaine]] in the [[Loire]] area of [[France]] in 1900. The authenticity/significance of this particular item was much debated and as late as 1992 Domitianus was widely considered &quot;at best a conjectural figure&quot;,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Okamura |title=Forging a Usurper in Late Roman Aquitania |journal=Hermes |volume=120 |issue=1 |year=1992 &lt;!--unnecessary? |pages=103-109--&gt; |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other coin was  found fused in a pot with some 5,000 other coins of the period 250-275 — thus providing incontrovertible provenance — in the village of [[Chalgrove]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], in 2003. The hoard was acquired by the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;CA194&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/083/ant0830751.htm |first=Richard |last=Abdy |journal=Antiquity |title=The Domitian II coin from Chalgrove: a Gallic emperor returns to history |volume=83 |issue=321 |pages=751–757 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of both coins is typical of those associated with the ‘Gallic Empire’. They are of the &quot;[[Radiate (coin)|radiate]]&quot; type and depict Domitianus as a bearded figure wearing a spiky or [[radiate crown]] representing the rays of the sun, in reference to [[Sol Invictus]] (i.e. the sun perceived as a deity lit. ‘the Unconquered Sun’). The representation is not realistic, but standardized and stereotypical and is very similar to that of the later coins of the &quot;[[Gallic Emperor]]&quot; [[Victorinus]] (269-271 AD) and the earliest of [[Tetricus I]], the last &quot;Gallic Emperor&quot; (271-274).

Both coins bear the same legend, ''i.e.'', &lt;small&gt;IMP C DOMITIANUS P F AUG&lt;/small&gt;, an abbreviation for &quot;Imperator Caesar Domitianus Pius Felix Augustus&quot;. An unusual feature here is the absence of any reference to Domitianus's &quot;[[Nomen (Roman name)|Nomen]]&quot; or &quot;[[Praenomen]]&quot;. &quot;Gallic Empire&quot; coins usually bear the full ''tria nomina'' of the prince celebrated the better to carry out their propagandist function. On the reverse, the coins show [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]], and have the legend &lt;small&gt;CONCORDIA MILITVM&lt;/small&gt;, a propagandistic claim that the army was united behind Domitianus. Again this is a standard slogan for the &quot;Gallic emperors.&quot;

The design of the Chalgrove coin and its Les Cléons counterpart is typical of others struck under the &quot;Gallic Empire.&quot; This suggests that it was struck by the mint (or mints) which serviced that regime – i.e. at Trier in the province of ‘’[[Gallia Belgica]]’’ or Cologne in ‘’[[Germania Inferior]]’’ or, at least, from a die produced by artisans who were strongly influenced  the design-ethos of those mints. It also suggests that the date of the coin was prior to 274 when the Emperor [[Aurelian]] suppressed the Gallic regime.

==Literary sources==
There are only two literary references for Domitianus's existence, neither of which names him as an emperor:

1. The 6th-century Byzantine historian [[Zosimus]] (i 49) records that a certain Domitianus was punished for a revolt during the reign of [[Aurelian]] (270-275). The text is vague as to the nature of his disloyalty and against whom it was directed. Because Zosimus places his coup in the reign of Aurelian and because he equates Domitianus with [[Septimius (Roman emperor usurper)|Septiminus]] (or Septimius) who was acclaimed Emperor by the [[Dalmatia]]n garrison at about the same time it has usually been assumed that Domitianus was directly challenging Aurelian and that his revolt took place within the territory of the central Empire – i.e. those provinces not controlled by either the ‘Gallic Emperors’ in the west or [[Zenobia]] in the east. (Watson suggests that his command lay somewhere south west of Lake Geneva – i.e. in the frontier region between the ‘Gallic’ and the ‘central’ Empires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=A. |title=Aurelian and the Third Century |page=52 |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;);

2. The notoriously unreliable [[Historia Augusta]], hereafter &quot;HA&quot;,  ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tyranni_XXX*.html#12.14 12.14]) mentions a Domitianus as a general involved in the suppression of the revolt of [[Macrianus Major]] in 261.&lt;ref name=&quot;CA194&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leins |first=Ian |title=Domitianus II - the forgotten emperor |journal=Current Archaeology |issue=194 |pages=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; HA asserts that in this operation Domitianus was an associate (possibly, a ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|cliens]]'', client or protégé) of Gallienus’s Hipparchos (Cavalry-Master-General) [[Aureolus]] who is normally credited with the victory over Macrianus. However, the reference is made in terms that suggest that Domitianus was already a distinguished commander in his own right. There is nowhere in HA any suggestion that this Domitianus or any other man of that name was involved in any anti-regime activities during Aurelian's reign.

HA also suggests that Domitianus was descendant of the Emperor [[Domitian]], the son of [[Vespasian]] and his wife [[Domitilla the Elder]]. The intention here may be to suggest that Domitianus was of senatorial rank. It is possible that his motive in doing this was to deflect some of the glory accruing to the low-born Aureolus from his suppression of the Macrianic rebellion. HA cannot bring himself to say anything that might appear to denigrate the achievement of Aureolus in this connection in comparison to the supine effeminacy of his ''bête noire'', the unworthy Gallienus.  However, he was probably happy to be able suggest that his associate, Domitianus, was ‘One of Us’. One might remark that if Domitianus had been a senator he would probably have fallen foul of the decision taken by Gallienus early in his sole reign to strip all aristocratic army officers of their commissions. He would not, therefore, have been allowed to command the forces sent against the Macriani.

==Suggested interpretation==
The evidence is not sufficient to confirm that the associate or protégé of Aureolus mentioned in the HA, the obscure rebel of Aurelian’s reign mentioned by Zosimus and the Imperial claimant celebrated in the coins were one and the same man. However, academic opinion is inclined to the view that, more likely than not, they were one and the same.

It is quite possible that, as a client of Aureolus, Domitianus would later have become associated with the Gallic regime given what is suspected and known about his [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'s relations with [[Postumus]]. If HA’s assertions as to his military reputation are correct it is not unlikely that he would have been welcomed into the entourage of the ‘Gallic Emperor’ and his successors. However, the evidence is too vague and circumstantial.

The evidence of his coins suggests that the Domitianus was almost certainly a military figure associated with the rebel ‘Gallic Empire’ who commanded troops close enough to one of the mint-cities of Trier or Cologne to ensure that his Imperial pretensions were proclaimed in the traditional manner. It was very difficult for would-be Emperors in regions where there was no established mint to issue coins.&lt;ref group=note&gt;So far as is known Domitianus’s contemporary Septiminus/Septimius in Dalmatia did not issue coins (no mint in Dalmatia) and the Illyrian rebel, [[Ingenuus]], had similarly failed twenty years before because [[Gallienus]] had removed his mint when he transferred his main theatre of operations in the defence of the west from the Danube to the Rhine. [[Regalianus]] too had only produced limited editions of over-strikes even though he survived for some considerable time after making his bid for power (260 AD).&lt;/ref&gt;

Given what is known of the chronology of the ‘Gallic Empire’ his bid for Empire is most probably associated with the period of confusion following the officers’ coup against the ‘Gallic Emperor’, Victorinus, early in 271. The men who murdered Victorinus seem to have had no political agenda and it is not surprising that there should have been period of confusion after his death. In this circumstance it would not have been surprising that a faction may have been tempted to put forward a figure such as Domitianus who had an established military reputation – particularly if he was, indeed, the same man  as the conqueror of the Macriani mentioned in the HA. On the other hand, the literary evidence does suggest that the forces favouring [[Tetricus I]] as the new Emperor were able to assert themselves so swiftly and decisively that Domitianus’s elevation was hardly remarked outside the provinces controlled by the 'Gallic Empire'.

The most likely interpretation of the evidence of the coins is that Domitianus was involved in the officer ''coup'' that overthrew [[Victorinus]] and managed to secure temporary control of one of the 'Gallic' mints. It is thus more likely that he was suppressed by [[Tetricus I]] than by the central [[Roman Emperor]] [[Aurelian]] as the Zosimus reference would appear to suggest.

The use of the ''cognomen'' alone in the Imperial title is sufficiently unusual to raise questions about the circumstances in which the coins were produced. The circumstances in which the Chalgrove specimen was discovered leaves no doubt that it was, indeed, struck by somebody in the early 270s AD, but we have to consider that it might have been produced by a faction of the Rhine army officer ‘’cadre’’ which hoped to use Domitianus as a figurehead, possibly without his knowledge or approval.

Domitianus's fate is unknown. One possibility is that he was either executed by Tetricus or, more likely, that he was murdered by his own troops when the main Rhine army garrisons declared for Tetricus. A second possibility is that he was defeated by [[Placidianus]], a general loyal to [[Aurelian]] who had been stationed to guard the lower [[Rhone]] valley during Victorinus' assault on [[Autun]] in 270. This would suggest that his rebellion took place in southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], near enough to the central empire's provinces to be of concern to Aurelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Alaric |title=Aurelian and the Third Century |year=2004 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucius Iulius (Julius) Aurelius Septimius Vabalathus Athenodorus''' (259-273) was a king of the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. Vabalathus is the Latinized form of his name in the [[Arabic language]], '''Wahb Allat''' or '''gift of the Goddess'''. As the Arabian goddess ''[[Al-lāt|Allāt]]'' came to be identified with Athena, he used ''Athenodorus'' as the Greek form of his name.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Life==
His father was Septimius [[Odaenathus]], King of Palmyra, and his mother was Queen [[Zenobia]]. When his father was assassinated by his cousin [[Maeonius]] (267), the young Vabalathus was made king (''rex consul imperator dux Romanorum'', &quot;illustrious King of Kings&quot; and ''[[corrector]] totius orientis'') of the Palmyrene Empire. Effective power was wielded by his mother Zenobia, who conquered [[Lower Egypt]], [[Syria (region)]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon]]. 

Initially the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Aurelian]] recognized Vabalathus' rule, perhaps because he was engaged in conflict with the [[Gallic Empire]] in the west and hesitated to incite open warfare with the Palmyrene Empire. This mutual recognition is testified by early coins minted under Vaballathus, in which Aurelian is portraited with the title ''[[augustus (honorific)|augustus]]''; however, the relationship between the two empires deteriorated and Aurelian disappeared from his coins, while Zenobia and Vabalathus have adopted the titles of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' and ''Augustus'' respectively.

The end of Vabalathus' rule came when Aurelian conquered and sacked [[Palmyra]] (272/3) and took Vabalathus and his mother back to [[Rome]] as hostages. According to [[Zosimus]], Vaballathus died on the way to Rome, but this theory has been neither confirmed nor disproved.

Other sources have implied that after shipping the defeated Zenobia and Vabalathus back to Rome, Aurelian allowed both of the rebels to live, but only after they had been marched through the streets of the imperial city in accordance with Roman tradition. This would have been humiliating, but better than death. This theory is supported by Aurelian's similar treatment of the Tetricii ([[Tetricus I]] and [[Tetricus II]]) in [[Gallic Empire|Gaul]], also allowing long time enemies of Rome to retire following their defeat at the [[Battle of Châlons (274)|Battle of Châlons]] in 274.

An excellent military tactician and a talented administrator, Aurelian was also one of the more merciful Roman Emperors in the empire's long history.

'''Publius''' (or '''Gaius''') '''Cornelius Tacitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|s|ɨ|t|ə|s}}; {{IPA-la|ˈtakɪtʊs|classical}}; c. AD 56 &amp;ndash; after 117) was a [[Roman Senate|senator]] and a [[historian]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The surviving portions of his two major works&amp;mdash;the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''&amp;mdash;examine the reigns of the [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Tiberius]], [[Claudius]], [[Nero]], and those who reigned in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (AD 69). These two works span the history of the [[Roman Empire]] from the death of [[Augustus]] in AD 14 to the years of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] in AD 70. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.

Tacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the Roman general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').

Tacitus is considered to be one of the greatest Roman historians.&lt;ref name=Voorst39 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Eerdmans Publishing ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 pages 39-42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Backgrounds of early Christianity'' by Everett Ferguson 2003 ISBN 0-8028-2221-5 page 116&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in what has been called the [[Silver Age of Latin literature]]. He is known for the brevity and compactness of his [[Latin language|Latin]] prose, as well as for his penetrating insights into the psychology of power politics.

==Life==
Details about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', 1890, pp. 621&amp;ndash;623&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;&lt;ref&gt;Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy&lt;/ref&gt; like many Latin authors of both the [[Golden Age of Latin Literature|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Latin literature|Silver Age]]s, he was from the provinces, probably northern [[Italy]] or [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.&lt;ref&gt;See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichità'', 2 (1972) 169&amp;ndash;185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and early life===
[[File:REmpire-04 Gallia Narbonensis.png|thumb|300px|right|Tacitus was probably born in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].]]
Most of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 612&amp;ndash;613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

His father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|N.H.]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother—if Cornelius was indeed his father.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship between the [[Pliny the Younger|younger Pliny]] and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest Gallia Belgica, Gallia Narbonensis, or northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Fabius Iustus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 614&amp;ndash;616&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 616&amp;ndash;619&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

His ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]].  This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 1936, pp. 150&amp;ndash;151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621&amp;ndash;624&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public life, marriage, and literary career===
As a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]&lt;ref&gt;The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; (c. AD 35 – c. 100).&lt;!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---&gt; In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'' 1.6, 9.10; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541&amp;ndash;542&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26&amp;ndash;27&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Vespasian]]&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])&lt;/ref&gt; (reigned 69-79), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].&lt;ref name=quaestor&gt;He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.&lt;/ref&gt; He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88. See Syme, 1958, p. 65; Martin, 1981, p. 27; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained acclaim as a lawyer and as an [[orator]]; his skill in public speaking ironically counterpoints his ''[[cognomen]]'' ''Tacitus'' (&quot;silent&quot;).

He served in the provinces from ca. 89 to ca. 93, either in command of a [[Roman legion|legion]] or in a civilian post.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Agricola'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+45 45.5]) indicates that Tacitus and his wife were absent at the time of Julius Agricola's death in 93. For his occupation during this time see Syme, 1958, p. 68; Benario, 1975, p. 13; Dudley, 1968, pp. 15&amp;ndash;16; Martin, 1981, p. 28; Mellor, 1993, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He and his property survived [[Domitian]]'s reign of terror (81&amp;ndash;96), but the experience left him jaded and perhaps ashamed at his own complicity, giving him the hatred of [[tyranny]] evident in his works.&lt;ref&gt;For the effects on Tacitus of this experience see Dudley, 1968, p. 14; Mellor, 1993, pp. 8&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Agricola'', chs. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+44 44]&amp;ndash;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+45 45], is illustrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Agricola was spared those later years during which Domitian, leaving now no interval or breathing space of time, but, as it were, with one continuous blow, drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth... It was not long before our hands dragged [[Helvidius Priscus|Helvidius]] to prison, before we gazed on the dying looks of [[Manricus]] and [[Arulenus Rusticus|Rusticus]], before we were steeped in [[Herennius Senecio|Senecio]]'s innocent blood. Even [[Nero]] turned his eyes away, and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his seat in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], he became [[suffect consul]] in 97 during the reign of [[Nerva]], being the [[novus homo|first of his family]] to do so. During his tenure, he reached the height of his fame as an orator when he delivered the funeral oration for the famous veteran soldier [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'', [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny02-01-L.html 2.1] [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny02-01-E.html (English)];
Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, he wrote and published the ''Agricola'' and ''Germania'', foreshadowing the literary endeavors that would occupy him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Agricola'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+3 3]), he announces what was probably his first major project: the ''Histories''. See Dudley, 1968, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he absented himself from public life, but returned during [[Trajan]]'s reign (98-117). In 100, he and his friend [[Pliny the Younger]] prosecuted [[Marius Priscus]] ([[proconsul]] of Africa) for corruption. Priscus was found guilty and sent into exile; Pliny wrote a few days later that Tacitus had spoken &quot;with all the majesty which characterizes his usual style of oratory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep2.html 2.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lengthy absence from politics and law followed while he wrote the ''Histories'' and the ''Annals''. In 112 or 113, he held the highest civilian governorship, that of the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|''Asia'']] in Western [[Anatolia]], recorded in the inscription found at [[Mylasa]] mentioned above. A passage in the ''Annals'' fixes 116 as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of his death, which may have been as late as 125 or even 130. It seems that he survived both Pliny (died ca. 113) and Trajan (died 117).&lt;ref&gt;
Grant in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Annals'', p. xvii; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germania'', p. 2. ''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire &quot;now extends to the [[Red Sea]]&quot;. If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387-393.
&lt;/ref&gt;
It remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (reigned 275-276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.&lt;ref&gt;
''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either &quot;a confused and worthless rumor&quot; (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or &quot;pure fiction&quot; (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus&amp;mdash;but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Five works ascribed to Tacitus are known to have survived (albeit with some lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. The dates are approximate:

* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')
* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')
* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')
* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')
* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')

===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===
The ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', 'in thirty volumes'.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of [[Domitian]] (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the Annals survived in a single copy of a manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]], and the second half from a single copy of a manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]], and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.

====The ''Histories''====
{{main|Histories (Tacitus)}}
In an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, [[Nerva]], and [[Trajan]]. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains&amp;mdash;as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]&amp;mdash;a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.

====The ''Annals''====
{{main|Annals (Tacitus)}}
The ''Annals'' is Tacitus' final work, covering the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7–10 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7–12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of [[Nero]], perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]] and no record survives of the work on [[Augustus Caesar]] and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christian]]s.
[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]

===Monographs===
Tacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]]; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of [[rhetoric]].

====''Germania''====
{{main|Germania (book)}}

The ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the [[Roman Empire]]. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1&amp;ndash;27) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes.  Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10&amp;ndash;13).

====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====
{{main|Agricola (book)}}
The ''Agricola'' (written ca. 98) recounts the life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and [[ethnography]] of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. &amp;mdash; Oxford Revised Translation).

====''Dialogus''====
[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]

{{main|Dialogus}}
There is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks for example the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in AD 102.

==Sources==
Tacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as [[Tiberius]] and [[Claudius]]. He is generally seen as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore proof-read) his work.

Tacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he placed no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34-35.

== Literary style ==
Tacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.

In most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the reader to construct that picture for himself. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.

=== Approach to history ===
Tacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating—often pessimistic—insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' I,1) is well known:
:{|-
|&quot;inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''
|}
There has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' &quot;neutrality&quot;. Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance—that of [[free speech]]—to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.

Tacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81&amp;ndash;96) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the [[Roman Empire|empire]].

Nonetheless, the image he builds of [[Tiberius]] throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.

In general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).

===Prose style===
His Latin style is highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: &quot;No other writer of Latin prose — not even Cicero — deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic&amp;mdash;the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as &quot;harsh, unpleasant, and thorny&quot; and praised as &quot;grave, concise, and pithily eloquent&quot;.

Compared to the [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|Ciceronian period]], where sentences were usually the length of a paragraph and artfully constructed with nested pairs of carefully matched sonorous phrases, this is short and to the point.  But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending &quot;...-entibus  ...-is&quot; are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions — which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;98&amp;ndash;9 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: &quot;... some writers &amp;mdash; notably the perverse genius Tacitus &amp;mdash; delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.&quot; – &quot;this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms ... only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

His historical works focus on the inner motivations of the characters, often with penetrating insight&amp;mdash;though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff&lt;/ref&gt; He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and [[dissimulation]]; for example, he follows a narrative recounting [[Tiberius]]' refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any &quot;treasonous&quot; speech or writings&amp;mdash;and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64&amp;ndash;66) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.

Tacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to [[Sallust]], and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.

==Studies and reception history==
{{main|Tacitean studies}}
From [[Pliny the Younger]]'s [http://thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep7.html 7th Letter (to Tacitus)], §33:
:{|
|-
|valign = &quot;top&quot; |Auguror nec me fallit augurium, historias tuas immortales futuras.
||&amp;nbsp;
|valign = &quot;top&quot; |I predict, and my predictions do not fail me, that your histories will be immortal.
|}

The historian was not much read in late antiquity, and even less in the Middle Ages. Only a third of his known work has survived; we depend on a single manuscript for books I-VI of the ''Annales'' and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI-XVI) and for the five books extant of the ''Historiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael, ''Latin Literature: an anthology'', Penguin Classics, London, 1978 p.378f&lt;/ref&gt; His antipathy towards the Jews and Christians of his time — he records with unemotional contempt the sufferings of the Christians at Rome during Nero's persecution — made him unpopular in the Middle Ages. He was rediscovered, however, by the Renaissance, whose writers were impressed with his dramatic presentation of the Imperial age.

Tacitus has been described as &quot;the greatest historian that the Roman world produced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mellor 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] opines that he &quot;ranks beyond dispute in the highest place among men of letters of all ages.&quot; His work has been read for its moral instruction, for its dramatic narrative, and for its prose style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellor1995pxvii&quot;&gt;Mellor, 1995, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the field of history, Tacitus' influence is most prominent in the area of political theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellor1995pxvii&quot; /&gt; The political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps, as identified by [[Giuseppe Toffanin]]: the &quot;red Tacitists&quot; use him to support [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, and the &quot;black Tacitists&quot; read him as a lesson in [[Machiavellian]] ''[[realpolitik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, 1969, pp. 162&amp;ndash;163&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his work is our most reliable source for the history of his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned. The ''Annals'' are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], who are both called [[Antonia (name)|Antonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius makes an occasional slip as well.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Histories'', however, are written from [[primary source|primary documents]] and intimate knowledge of the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to be more accurate.

'''Carus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Carus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Carus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS CARVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt; c. 222&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; – July or August 283) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 282 to 283, and was 60 at ascension.During his short reign, Carus fought the [[Germanic tribes]] and [[Sarmatians]] along the [[Danube]] frontier with success. He brought stability in the empire and died in 283 aged 61.

During his campaign against the [[Sassanid Empire]], he sacked their capital [[Ctesiphon]], but died shortly thereafter. He was succeeded by his sons [[Carinus]] and [[Numerian]], creating a dynasty which, though short-lived, granted further stability to a resurgent empire.

==Biography==
[[File:Antoninianus of Carus.jpg|thumb|200px|An [[Antoninianus]] of Carus.]]
Carus, whose name before the accession may have been Marcus Numerius Carus,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt;  was likely born at [[Narbonne|Narbo (modern Narbonne)]] in Gaul&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The tradition that he was one of the so-called &quot;[[Illyrian Emperors]]&quot;, based on the unreliable ''vita Cari'' embedded in the [[Augustan History]], was accepted uncritically by [[Joseph Scaliger]], who assumed the other sources were wrong, and followed by [[Edward Gibbon]] in ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. (Tom B. Jones, &quot;A Note on Marcus Aurelius Carus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''37'''.2 (April 1942), pp. 193–194).&lt;/ref&gt; but was educated in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 4:2&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[Roman Senate|senator]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and filled various civil and military posts before being appointed [[prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]] by the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] in 282.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg.105&lt;/ref&gt;

After the murder of Probus at [[Sirmium]], Carus was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:29&lt;/ref&gt; Although Carus severely avenged the death of Probus, he was suspected as an accessory to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;  He does not seem to have returned to Rome after his accession, contenting himself with an announcement to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Emperor Carus portraiture.jpg|thumbnail]] --&gt;

===Campaign against the Sassanids and Death===
Bestowing the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] upon his sons Carinus and Numerian,&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor 38:2&lt;/ref&gt; he left Carinus in charge of the western portion of the empire and took Numerian with him on an expedition against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], which had been contemplated by Probus.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 7:1&lt;/ref&gt;  Having defeated the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] on the [[Danube]],&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was given the title ''Germanicus Maximus'',&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, www.roman-emperors.org/carus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Carus proceeded through [[Thrace]] and [[Asia Minor]], annexed [[Mesopotamia]], pressed on to [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]], and marched his soldiers beyond the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid King]] [[Bahram II]], limited by internal opposition and his troops occupied with a campaign in modern day [[Afghanistan]], could not effectively defend his territory.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, www.roman-emperors.org/carus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The victories of Carus avenged all the previous defeats suffered by the Romans against the Sassanids, and he received the title of ''Persicus Maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Carus' hopes of further conquest were cut short by his death, which was announced after a violent storm.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 8:3&lt;/ref&gt;   His death was variously attributed to disease,&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, &quot;Vita Cari&quot;, 8:2&lt;/ref&gt; the effects of [[lightning]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 38:3&lt;/ref&gt; or a wound received in the campaign against the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:30&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was leading a victorious campaign, and his son Numerian succeeded him without opposition, suggest that his death may have been due to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, www.roman-emperors.org/carus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julian''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Claudius Iulianus Augustus}}, {{lang-el|Φλάβιος Κλαύδιος Ἰουλιανὸς Αὔγουστος}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Julian's name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS CLAVDIVS IVLIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 331/332&lt;ref&gt;Tougher, 12, citing Bouffartigue: ''L'Empereur Julien et la culture de son temps'' p. 30 for the argument for 331; A.H. Jones, J.R. Martindale, and J. Morris &quot;Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. I&quot; p.447 (Iulianus 29) argues for May or June 332.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;– 26 June 363), also known as '''Julian the Apostate''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 361 to 363, as well as a notable [[philosopher]] and author in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Grant, Michael |title=Greek and Latin authors, 800 B.C.-A.D. 1000, Part 1000 |publisher=H. W.

A member of the [[Constantinian dynasty]], Julian became ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' over the western provinces by order of [[Constantius II]] in 355 and in this role campaigned successfully against the [[Alamanni]] and [[Franks]]. Most notable was his crushing victory over the Alamanni in 357 at the Battle of Argentoratum (Strasbourg), leading his 13,000 men against a Germanic army three times larger. In 360 in [[Lutetia]] (Paris) he was proclaimed ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' by his soldiers, sparking a civil war between Julian and Constantius. Before the two could face each other in battle, however, Constantius died, after naming Julian as his rightful successor. In 363, Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Though initially successful, Julian was mortally wounded in battle and died shortly thereafter.

Julian was a man of unusually complex character: he was &quot;the military commander, the theosophist, the social reformer, and the man of letters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Downey, &quot;Julian the Apostate at Antioch&quot;, ''Church History'', Vol. 8, No. 4 (December, 1939), pp. 303–315. See p.305.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last non-Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, and it was his desire to bring the Empire back to its ancient Roman values in order to, as he saw it, save it from dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassiadi, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; He purged the top-heavy state bureaucracy and attempted to revive [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religious practices]] at the cost of [[Christianity]]. His [[anti-Christian sentiment]] and promotion of [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] [[paganism]] caused him to be remembered as Julian the [[apostasy|Apostate]] (Ἀποστάτης ''Apostates'', &quot;a person who has abandoned their religion, principles&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;) by the church.&lt;ref name=gibbon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|page=Chapter 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last emperor of the [[Constantinian dynasty]], the empire's first Christian dynasty.

===Early life===
[[Image:Solidus Julian-transparent.png|thumb|300px|left|Julian [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], ''c.'' 361. The obverse shows a bearded Julian with an inscription, FL(AVIVS) CL(AVDIVS) IVLIANVS PP AVG (PP=Pater Patriae, &quot;father of the nation&quot;; AVG=Augustus). The reverse depicts an armed Roman soldier bearing a military standard in one hand and subduing a captive with the other, a reference to the military strength of the Roman Empire, and spells out VIRTVS EXERCITVS ROMANORVM, &quot;the bravery/virtue of the Roman army&quot;. Under the soldier one reads SIRM indicating the coin was minted in [[Sirmium]], the home of Constantine's family.]]

Flavius Claudius Julianus, born in May or June 332&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Jones, J.R. Martindale, and J. Morris &quot;Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. I&quot; p.447.&lt;/ref&gt; or 331 in [[Constantinople]], was the son of Julius Constantius ([[consul]] in 335), half brother of Emperor [[Constantine I]], and his second wife, [[Basilina]], a woman of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Norwich, John Julius |title= Byzantium: the early centuries |publisher= Knopf |year= 1989 |page= 83 |isbn= 0-394-53778-5 |quote= Julius Constantius...Constantine had invited him, with his second wife and his young family, to take up residence in his new capital; and it was in Constantinople that his third son Julian was born, in May or June of the year 332.

His paternal grandparents were [[Western Roman Emperor]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] and his second wife, [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora]]. His maternal grandfather was [[Julius Julianus]], [[praetorian prefect of the East]] under emperor [[Licinius]] from 315 to 324 and [[roman consul|consul]] after 325.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martindale, and Morris (1971) ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' volume 1, p.148, 478–479. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Julian's maternal grandmother is unknown.

In the turmoil after the death of Constantine in 337, in order to establish himself and his brothers, Julian's zealous [[Arianism|Arian]] cousin [[Constantius II]] appears to have led a massacre of most of Julian's close relatives.  Constantius II allegedly ordered the murders of many descendants from the second marriage of Constantius Chlorus and Theodora, leaving only Constantius and his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans|Constans I]], and their cousins, Julian and [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]] (Julian's half-brother), as the surviving males related to Emperor Constantine. Constantius II, Constans I, and Constantine II were proclaimed joint emperors, each ruling a portion of Roman territory. Julian and Gallus were excluded from public life, were strictly guarded in their youth, and given a Christian education. They were likely saved by their youth and at the urging of the Empress Eusebia. If Julian's later writings are to be believed, Constantius would later be tormented with guilt at the massacre of 337.

Initially growing up in [[Bithynia]], raised by his maternal grandmother, at the age of seven he was under the guardianship of [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], the semi-Arian Christian Bishop of Nicomedia, and taught by Mardonius, a [[Goths|Gothic]] [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]], about whom Julian later wrote warmly. After Eusebius died in 342, both Julian and Gallus were exiled to the imperial estate of Macellum in [[Cappadocia]]. Here Julian met the Christian bishop [[George of Cappadocia]], who lent him books from the classical tradition.  At the age of 18, the exile was lifted and he dwelt briefly in Constantinople and [[Nicomedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, pp.44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[lector]], a minor office in the Christian church, and his later writings show a detailed knowledge of the Bible, likely acquired in his early life.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 44, citing Julian to the Alexandrians, Wright's letter 47, of November or December 362. [[Ezekiel Spanheim]] 434D. ''Twelve'' would be literal, but Julian is counting inclusively.&lt;/ref&gt; (Looking back on his life in 362, Julian wrote, in his thirty-first year, that he had spent twenty years in the way of Christianity and twelve in the true way, i.e., the way of [[Helios]].)&lt;ref&gt;Letter 47, Wright, v.3, p.149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian studied Neoplatonism in Asia Minor in 351, at first under [[Aedesius]], the philosopher, and then Neoplatonic [[theurgy]] from Aedesius' student, [[Maximus of Ephesus]]. He was summoned to Constantius' court in [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) in 354 and kept there for a year; in the summer and fall of 355, he was permitted to study in [[Athens]]. While there, Julian became acquainted with two men who later became both bishops and saints: [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]]. In the same period, Julian was also initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], which he would later try to restore.

Constantine II died in 340 when he attacked his brother Constans. Constans in turn fell in 350 in the war against the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. This left Constantius II as the sole remaining emperor. In need of support, in 351 he made Julian's half-brother, [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]], [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of the East, while Constantius II himself turned his attention westward to Magnentius, whom he defeated decisively that year. In 354 Gallus, who had imposed a rule of terror over the territories under his command, was executed. Julian was summoned to court, and held for a year, under suspicion of treasonable intrigue, first with his brother and then with [[Claudius Silvanus]]; he was cleared, in part because the Empress [[Eusebia (empress)|Eusebia]] intervened on his behalf, and he was sent to Athens. (Julian expresses his gratitude to the empress Eusebia in his third oration.)&lt;ref&gt;R. Browning, ''The Emperor Julian'' (London, 1975), pp. 74–5. However, Shaun Tougher, &quot;The Advocacy of an Empress: Julian and Eusebia&quot; (''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 48, No. 2 (1998), pp. 595–599), argues that the kind Eusebia of Julian's panegyric is a literary creation and that she was doing the bidding of her husband in bringing Julian around to doing what Constantius had asked of him. See especially p.597.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caesar in Gaul===
After dealing with the rebellions of Magnentius and Sylvanus, Constantius felt he needed a permanent representative in Gaul. In 355, Julian was summoned to appear before the emperor in Mediolanum and on 6 November was made Caesar of the West, marrying Constantius' sister, [[Helena (wife of Julian)|Helena]]. Constantius, after his experience with Gallus, intended his representative to be more a figurehead than an active participant in events, so he packed Julian off to Gaul with a small retinue and Constantius' prefects in Gaul would keep him in check. At first reluctant to trade his scholarly life for war and politics, he eventually took every opportunity to involve himself in the affairs of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay AD 180–395'', p.499.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years Julian learned how to lead and then run an army, through a series of campaigns against the [[Germanic tribes]] that had settled on both sides of the [[Rhine#Antiquity|Rhine]].

====Campaigns against Germanic kingdoms====
[[Image:153 Julianus II-transparent.png|right|thumb|Julian in military dress. Despite having received no military education, Julian proved to be an able military commander, obtaining an [[battle of Strasbourg|important victory]] in [[Gaul]] and leading a Roman army under the walls of the [[Sassanid Empire]]'s capital.]]
In 356 during his first campaign he led an army to the Rhine, engaged the inhabitants there and won back several towns that had fallen into [[Franks|Frankish]] hands, including [[Colonia Agrippina]] ([[Cologne]]). With success under his belt he withdrew for the winter to Gaul, distributing his forces to protect various towns, and choosing the small town of [[Senon]] near [[Verdun#History|Verdun]] to await the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Most sources give the town as [[Sens]], which is well into the interior of Gaul. See John F. Drinkwater, ''The Alamanni and Rome 213–496'', OUP Oxford 2007, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out to be a tactical error, for he was left with insufficient forces to defend himself when a large contingent of Franks besieged the town and Julian was virtually held captive there for several months, until his general Marcellus deigned to lift the siege. Relations between Julian and Marcellus seem to have been poor. Constantius accepted Julian's report of events and Marcellus was replaced as ''[[magister equitum]]'' by Severus.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay AD 180–395'', p.501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year saw a combined operation planned by Constantius to regain control of the Rhine from the Germanic peoples that had spilt across the river onto the west bank. From the south his ''[[magister peditum]]'' [[Barbatio]] was to come from Milan and amass forces at [[Kaiseraugst|Augst]] (near the Rhine bend), then set off north with 25,000 soldiers; Julian with 13,000 troops would move east from [[Durocortorum]] ([[Rheims]]). However, while Julian was in transit, a group of [[Laeti]] attacked [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]) and Julian was delayed in order to deal with them. This left Barbatio unsupported and deep in [[Alamanni]] territory, so he felt obliged to withdraw, retracing his steps. Thus ended the coordinated operation against the Germanic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, p.501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, pp.50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Barbatio safely out of the picture, King [[Chnodomarius]] led a confederation of Alamanni forces against Julian and Severus at the of [[Battle of Argentoratum]]. The Romans were heavily outnumbered&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus says that there were 35,000 Alamanni, ''Res Gestae'', 16.12.26, though this figure is now thought to be an overestimate – see David S. Potter, p.501.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the heat of battle a group of 600 horsemen on the right wing deserted,&lt;ref&gt;D. Woods, &quot;On the 'Standard-Bearers' at Strasbourg: Libanius, or. 18.58–66&quot;, ''Mnemosyne, Fourth Series'', Vol. 50, Fasc. 4 (August, 1997), p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; yet, taking full advantage of the limitations of the terrain, the Romans were overwhelmingly victorious. The enemy was routed and driven into the river. King Chnodomarius was captured and later sent to Constantius in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, pp.501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Ancient History p.51&quot;&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]], who was a participant in the battle, portrays Julian in charge of events on the battlefield&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus ''Res Gestae'', 16.12.27ff, 38ff, 55&lt;/ref&gt; and describes how the soldiers, because of this success, acclaimed Julian attempting to make him [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], an acclamation he rejected, rebuking them. He later rewarded them for their valor.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus ''Res Gestae'', 16.12.64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than chase the routed enemy across the Rhine, Julian now proceeded to follow the Rhine north, the route he followed the previous year on his way back to Gaul. At [[Moguntiacum]] ([[Mainz]]), however, he crossed the Rhine in an expedition that penetrated deep into what is today Germany, and forced three local kingdoms to submit. This action showed the Alamanni that Rome was once again present and active in the area. On his way back to winter quarters in Paris he dealt with a band of Franks that had taken control of some abandoned forts along the [[Meuse River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Ancient History p.51&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John F. Drinkwater, ''The Alamanni and Rome 213–496'', pp.240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 358, Julian gained victories over the [[Salian Franks]] on the [[Lower Rhine]], settling them in [[Toxandria]] in the Roman Empire, north of today's city of [[Tongeren]], and over the Chamavi, who were expelled back to [[Hamaland]].

====Taxation and administration====
At the end of 357 Julian, with the prestige of his victory over the Alamanni to give him confidence, prevented a tax increase by the Gallic praetorian prefect [[Florentius (prefect)|Florentius]] and personally took charge of the province of ''[[Gallia Belgica|Belgica Secunda]]''. This was Julian's first experience with civil administration, where his views were influenced by his liberal education in Greece. Properly it was a role that belonged to the praetorian prefect.  However, Florentius and Julian often clashed over the administration of Gaul. Julian's first priority, as Caesar and nominal ranking commander in Gaul, was to drive out the barbarians who had breached the [[Rhine]] frontier. However, he sought to win over the support of the civil population, which was necessary for his operations in Gaul and also to show his largely Germanic army the benefits of Imperial rule.  He therefore felt it was necessary to rebuild stable and peaceful conditions in the devastated cities and countryside. For this reason, Julian clashed with Florentius over the latter's support of tax increases, as mentioned above, and Florentius's own corruption in the bureaucracy.

Constantius attempted to maintain some modicum of control over his Caesar, which explains his removal of Julian's close adviser [[Salutius|Saturninius Secundus Salutius]] from Gaul. His departure stimulated the writing of Julian's oration, &quot;Consolation Upon the Departure of Salutius&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athanassiadi, p.69&quot;&gt;Athanassiadi, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellion in Paris===
[[File:Julien crowned Emperor in Cluny in February 360.jpg|thumb|19th century depiction of Julian being proclaimed Emperor in Paris at the [[Thermes de Cluny]], standing on a shield in the [[Franks|Frankish]] manner, in February 360.]]
In the fourth year of Julian's stay in Gaul, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Emperor]], [[Shapur II]], invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of [[Diyarbakır|Amida]] after a 73-day siege. In February 360, Constantius II ordered more than half of Julian's Gallic troops to his eastern army, the order by-passing Julian and going directly to the military commanders. Although Julian at first attempted to expedite the order, it provoked an insurrection by troops of the ''[[Petulantes]]'', who had no desire to leave Gaul. According to the historian [[Zosimus]], the army officers were those responsible for distributing an anonymous tract&lt;ref&gt;''grammation'': cf. Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', 3.9, commented by Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt; expressing complaints against Constantius as well as fearing for Julian's ultimate fate. Notably absent at the time was the prefect Florentius, who was usually never far from Julian's side, though now he was kept busy organizing supplies in Vienne and away from any strife that the order could cause. Julian would later blame him for the arrival of the order from Constantius.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, Letter to the Athenians, 282C.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammianus Marcellinus even suggested that the fear of Julian gaining more popularity than himself caused Constantius to send the order on the urging of Florentius.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus ''Res Gestae'', 20.4.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The troops proclaimed Julian ''Augustus'' in Paris, and this in turn led to a very swift military effort to secure or win the allegiance of others. Although the full details are unclear, there is evidence to suggest that Julian may have at least partially stimulated the insurrection. If so, he went back to business as usual in Gaul, for, from June to August of that year, Julian led a successful campaign against the Attuarian Franks.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus ''Res Gestae'', 20.10.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Julian began openly using the title ''Augustus,'' even issuing coins with the title, sometimes with Constantius, sometimes without. He celebrated his fifth year in Gaul with a big show of games.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, p.506.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 361, Julian led his army into the territory of the Alamanni, where he captured their king, Vadomarius. Julian claimed that Vadomarius had been in league with Constantius, encouraging him to raid the borders of [[Raetia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History v.13, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian then divided his forces, sending one column to Raetia, one to northern Italy and the third he led down the Danube on boats. His forces claimed control of Illyricum and his general, Nevitta, secured the pass of Succi into Thrace. He was now well out of his comfort zone and on the road to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History v.13, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; (Julian would state in late November that he set off down this road &quot;because, having been declared a public enemy, I meant to frighten him [Constantius] merely, and that our quarrel should result in intercourse on more friendly terms...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a private letter to his Uncle Julian, in W.C. Wright, v.3, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, in June, forces loyal to Constantius captured the city of [[Aquileia]] on the north Adriatic coast, an event which threatened to cut Julian off from the rest of his forces, while Constantius's troops marched towards him from the east. Aquileia was subsequently besieged by 23,000 men loyal to Julian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nor2&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 89&lt;/ref&gt; All Julian could do was sit it out in Naissus, the city of Constantine's birth, waiting for news and writing letters to various cities in Greece justifying his actions (of which only the letter to the Athenians has survived in its entirety).&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History v.13, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil war was avoided only by the death on November 3 of Constantius, who, in his last will, is alleged by some sources to have recognized Julian as his rightful successor.

===The new emperor and his administration===
[[Image:Kokkinobaphos Holy Apostles.jpg|right|thumb|''The Church of the Holy Apostles, where Julian brought Constantius II to be buried.'']]
On December 11, 361, Julian entered Constantinople as sole emperor and, despite his rejection of Christianity, his first political act was to preside over Constantius' Christian burial, escorting the body to the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Church of the Apostles]], where it was placed alongside that of Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; This act was a demonstration of his lawful right to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassiadi, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also now thought to have been responsible for the building of [[Santa Costanza]] on a Christian site just outside Rome as a [[mausoleum]] for his wife Helena and sister-in-law [[Constantina]].&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Matilda. ''The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide'', p. 249-252, 2001, Sussex Academic Press, ISBN 1-902210-58-1, ISBN 978-1-902210-58-2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUN1K78QMskC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=santa+costanza+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g2NRTvayJMzD8QOjwNyvBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=santa%20costanza%20rome&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Emperor rejected the style of administration of his immediate predecessors. He blamed Constantine for the state of the administration and for having abandoned the traditions of the past. He made no attempt to restore the [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchal]] system begun under [[Diocletian]]. Nor did he seek to rule as an absolute autocrat. His own philosophic notions led him to idealize the reigns of [[Hadrian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]].  In his first [[panegyric]] to Constantius, Julian described the ideal ruler as being essentially ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (&quot;first among equals&quot;), operating under the same laws as his subjects. While in Constantinople therefore it was not strange to see Julian frequently active in the Senate, participating in debates and making speeches, placing himself at the level of the other members of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, pp. 63–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

He viewed the royal court of his predecessors as inefficient, corrupt, and expensive. Thousands of servants, eunuchs, and superfluous officials were therefore summarily dismissed. He set up the [[Chalcedon tribunal]] to deal with the corruption of the previous administration under the supervision of ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Arbitio]]. Several high-ranking officials under Constantius including the chamberlain Eusebius were found guilty and executed. (Julian was conspicuously absent from the proceedings, perhaps signaling his displeasure at their necessity.)&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; He continually sought to reduce what he saw as a burdensome and corrupt bureaucracy within the Imperial administration whether it involved civic officials, the secret agents, or the imperial post service.

Another effect of Julian's political philosophy was that the authority of the cities was expanded at the expense of the imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the ''aurum coronarium'' was made voluntary rather than a compulsory tax. Additionally, arrears of land taxes were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself. Forgiving back taxes both made Julian more popular and allowed him to increase collections of current taxes.

While he ceded much of the authority of the imperial government to the cities, Julian also took more direct control himself. For example, new taxes and [[corvée]]s had to be approved by him directly rather than left to the judgement of the bureaucratic apparatus. Julian certainly had a clear idea of what he wanted Roman society to be, both in political as well as religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire. If the cities were treated as relatively autonomous local administrative areas, it would simplify the problems of imperial administration, which as far as Julian was concerned, should be focused on the administration of the law and defense of the empire's vast frontiers.

In replacing Constantius's political and civil appointees, Julian drew heavily from the intellectual and professional classes, or kept reliable holdovers, such as the [[rhetoric]]ian [[Themistius]]. His choice of consuls for the year 362 was more controversial. One was the very acceptable [[Claudius Mamertinus]], previously the [[Praetorian prefect]] of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. The other, more surprising choice was [[Nevitta]], Julian's trusted [[Franks|Frankish]] general. This latter appointment made overt the fact that an emperor's authority depended on the power of the army. Julian's choice of Nevitta appears to have been aimed at maintaining the support of the Western army which had acclaimed him.

===Clash with the Antiochenes===
After five months of dealings at the capital, Julian left Constantinople in May and moved to [[Antioch]], arriving in mid-July and staying there for nine months before launching his fateful campaign against Persia in March 363. Antioch was a city favored by splendid temples along with a famous oracle of Apollo in nearby Daphne, which may have been cause for him choosing to reside there. It had also been used in the past as a staging place for amassing troops, a purpose which Julian intended to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

His arrival on 18 July was well received by the Antiochenes, though it coincided with the celebration of the ''Adonia'', a festival which marked the death of [[Adonis]], so there was wailing and moaning in the streets—not a good omen for an arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, v.13 p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersock, p.96&quot;&gt;Bowersock, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian soon discovered that wealthy merchants were causing food problems, apparently by hoarding food and selling it at high prices. He hoped that the curia would deal with the issue for the situation was headed for a famine. When the curia did nothing, he spoke to the city's leading citizens, trying to persuade them to take action. Thinking that they would do the job, he turned his attention to religious matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersock, p.96&quot;/&gt;

He tried to resurrect the ancient oracular spring of Castalia at the temple of [[Apollo]] at Daphne. After being advised that the bones of 3rd-century bishop [[Babylas of Antioch|Babylas]] were suppressing the god, he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.12.8 – 22.13.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 3.18&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curia still took no substantial action in regards to the food shortage, Julian intervened, fixing the prices for grain and importing more from Egypt. Then landholders refused to sell theirs, claiming that the harvest was so bad that they had to be compensated with fair prices. Julian accused them of [[price gouging]] and forced them to sell. Various parts of Libanius' orations may suggest that both sides were justified to some extent&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, ''Orations'', 18.195 &amp; 16.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, ''Orations'', 1.126 &amp; 15.20&lt;/ref&gt; while Ammianus blames Julian for &quot;a mere thirst for popularity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.14.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian's ascetic lifestyle was not popular either, since his subjects were accustomed to the idea of an all-powerful Emperor who placed himself well above them. Nor did he improve his dignity with his own participation in the ceremonial of bloody sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.14.3&lt;/ref&gt;
As David S. Potter says:
{{quote|text=They expected a man who was both removed from them by the awesome spectacle of imperial power, and would validate their interests and desires by sharing them from his Olympian height (...) He was supposed to be interested in what interested his people, and he was supposed to be dignified. He was not supposed to leap up and show his appreciation for a [[panegyric]] that it was delivered, as Julian had done on January 3, when Libanius was speaking, and ignore the chariot races.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', pp. 515–516&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then tried to address public criticism and mocking of him by issuing a satire ostensibly on himself, called [[Misopogon]] or &quot;Beard Hater&quot;. There he blames the people of Antioch for preferring that their ruler have his virtues in the face rather than in the soul.

Even Julian's intellectual friends and fellow pagans were of a divided mind about this habit of talking to his subjects on an equal footing: Ammianus Marcellinus saw in that only the foolish vanity of someone &quot;excessively anxious for empty distinction&quot;, whose &quot;desire for popularity often led him to converse with unworthy persons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.7.1, 25.4.17 (Commented by Veyne, ''L&quot;Empire Gréco-Romain'', p.77)&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving Antioch he appointed Alexander of Heliopolis as governor, a violent and cruel man whom the Antiochene [[Libanius]], a friend of the emperor, admits on first thought was a &quot;dishonourable&quot; appointment. Julian himself described the man as &quot;undeserving&quot; of the position, but appropriate &quot;for the avaricious and rebellious people of Antioch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/libanius_02_16_letters_to_julian.htm#C10 Letter 622] by Libanius: &quot;That Alexander was appointed to the government at first, I confess, gave me some concern, as the principal persons among us were dissatisfied.  I thought it dishonourable, injurious, and unbecoming a prince; and that repeated fines would rather weaken than improve the city....&quot; and the translator's note upon it: &quot;This is the Alexander of whom Ammianus says (23.2), &quot;When Julian was going to leave Antioch, he made one Alexander of Heliopolis, governor of Syria, a turbulent and severe man, saying that 'undeserving as he was, such a ruler suited the avaricious and contumellious Antiochians'.&quot;  As the letter makes clear, Julian handed the city over to be looted by a man he himself regarded as unworthy, and the Christian inhabitants, who had dared to oppose his attempt to restore paganism, to be forced to attend and applaud pagan ceremonies at sword-point; and be 'urged' to cheer more loudly.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Persian campaign===
{{Campaignbox Julian's Persian War}}
Julian's rise to Augustus was the result of military insurrection eased by Constantius's sudden death. This meant that, while he could count on the wholehearted support of the Western army which had aided his rise, the Eastern army was an unknown quantity originally loyal to the Emperor he had risen against, and he had tried to woo it through the [[Chalcedon Tribunal]]. However, to solidify his position in the eyes of the eastern army, he needed to lead its soldiers to victory and a campaign against the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid Persians]] offered such an opportunity.

An audacious plan was formulated whose goal was to lay siege on the Sassanid capital city of [[Ctesiphon]] and definitively secure the eastern border. Yet the full motivation for this ambitious operation is, at best, unclear. There was no direct necessity for an invasion, as the Sassanids sent envoys in the hope of settling matters peacefully. Julian rejected this offer.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, Oration 12, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Ammianus states that Julian longed for revenge on the Persians and that a certain desire for combat and glory also played a role in his decision to go to war.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.12.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Death of Julian - manuscript.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration from ''The Fall of Princes'' by [[John Lydgate]] (which is a translation of ''De Casibus Virorum Illustribus'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) depicting &quot;the skyn of Julyan&quot;. There is no evidence that Julian's corpse was skinned and displayed, and it is likely that the illustrator simply confused the fate of Julian's body with that of Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]].]]

====Into enemy territory====
On 5 March 363, despite a series of omens against the campaign, Julian [[Julian's Persian War|departed from Antioch]] with about 65,000–83,000,&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', book 3, chapter 12. Zosimus' text is ambiguous and refers to a smaller force of 18,000 under Procopius and a larger force of 65,000 under Julian himself; it's unclear if the second figure includes the first.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elton, Hugh, ''Warfare in Roman Europe AD 350–425'', p. 210, using the higher estimate of 83,000.&lt;/ref&gt; or 80,000–90,000 men,&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Julian the Apostate'', p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; and headed north toward the [[Euphrates]]. En route he was met by embassies from various small powers offering assistance, none of which he accepted. He did order the Armenian king [[Arshak II|Arsaces]] to muster an army and await instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.2.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; He crossed the Euphrates near [[Manbij|Hierapolis]] and moved eastward to [[Harran|Carrhae]], giving the impression that his chosen route into Persian territory was down the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Notes, p.318.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it seems he sent a force of 30,000 soldiers under [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] and Sebastianus further eastward to devastate [[Media (region)|Media]] in conjunction with Armenian forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersock, p.110&quot;&gt;Bowersock, ''Julian the Apostate'', p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; This was where two earlier Roman campaigns had concentrated and where the main Persian forces were soon directed.&lt;ref name=&quot;David S p.517&quot;&gt;David S, Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p.517.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's strategy lay elsewhere, however. He had had a fleet built of over 1,000 ships at [[Samosata]] in order to supply his army for a march down the Euphrates and of 50 pontoon ships to facilitate river crossings. Procopius and the Armenians would march down the Tigris to meet Julian near Ctesiphon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersock, p.110&quot;/&gt; Julian's ultimate aim seems to have been &quot;regime change&quot; by replacing king [[Shapur II]] with his brother [[Hormizd (Constantinople)|Hormisdas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;David S p.517&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Epistulae'', 1402.2&lt;/ref&gt;

After feigning a march further eastward, Julian's army turned south to [[Circesium]] at the confluence of the [[Khabur River|Abora]] (Khabur) and the Euphrates arriving at the beginning of April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersock, p.110&quot;/&gt; Passing [[Dura-Europos|Dura]] on April 6, the army made good progress, bypassing towns after negotiations or besieging those which chose to oppose him. At the end of April the Romans captured the fortress of [[Anbar (town)|Pirisabora]], which guarded the canal approach from the Euphrates to Ctesiphon on the Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgeon &amp; Lieu, ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars'', p.203.&lt;/ref&gt; As the army marched toward the Persian capital, the Sassanids broke the dikes which crossed the land, turning it into [[marshland]], slowing the progress of the Roman army.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 24.3.10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ctesiphon====
By mid-May, the army had reached the vicinity of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgeon &amp; Lieu, ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars'', p.204.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans [[battle of Ctesiphon (363)|gained a tactical victory]] over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Ancient History, p.75&quot;&gt;Cambridge Ancient History, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Persian capital was not taken, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworth, ''How Rome fell''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-300-13719-4 , page 232&lt;/ref&gt; In the council of war which followed, Julian's generals persuaded him not to mount a [[siege]] against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 24.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Ancient History, p.75&quot;/&gt; This proved to be a hasty decision, for they were on the wrong side of the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans' path. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], but northward to [[Corduene]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 24.8.1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon p.205&quot;&gt;Dodgeon &amp; Lieu, ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the withdrawal, Julian's forces suffered several attacks from Sassanid forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon p.205&quot;/&gt; In one such engagement on 26 June 363, the indecisive [[Battle of Samarra]] near Maranga, Julian was wounded when the Sassanid army raided his column. In the haste of pursuing the retreating enemy, Julian chose speed rather than caution, taking only his sword and leaving his coat of mail.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 25.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; He received a wound from a spear that reportedly pierced the lower lobe of his liver, the peritoneum and [[intestine]]s. The wound was not immediately deadly. Julian was treated by his personal physician, [[Oribasius]] of Pergamum, who seems to have made every attempt to treat the wound. This probably included the irrigation of the wound with a dark [[wine]], and a procedure known as ''gastrorrhaphy'', the suturing of the damaged intestine. On the third day a major hemorrhage occurred and the emperor died during the night.&lt;ref&gt;Lascaratos, John and Dionysios Voros. 2000 Fatal Wounding of the Byzantine Emperor Julian the Apostate (361–363 A.D.): Approach to the Contribution of Ancient Surgery. World Journal of Surgery 24: 615–619. See p.618.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that Ammianus Marcellinus (''Res Gestae'', 25.3.6 &amp; 23) is of the view that Julian died the night of the same day that he was wounded.&lt;/ref&gt; As Julian wished, his body was buried outside [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], though it was later removed to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael. ''The Roman Emperors.'' (New York: Barnes and Noble Books, 1997), pp. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 364, Libanius stated that Julian was assassinated by a Christian who was one of his own soldiers;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'', 18.274&lt;/ref&gt; this charge is not corroborated by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] or other contemporary historians. [[John Malalas]] reports that the supposed assassination was commanded by [[Basil of Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Joannes Malalas, Chronographia, 333–334. Patrologia Graeca XCII, col. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen years later, Libanius said that Julian was killed by a Saracen ([[Lakhmid]]) and this may have been confirmed by Julian's doctor Oribasius who, having examined the wound, said that it was from a spear used by a group of Lakhmid auxiliaries in Persian service.&lt;ref&gt;evidence preserved by [[Philostorgius]], see David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay AD&amp;nbsp;180–395'', p.518&lt;/ref&gt; Later Christian historians propagated the tradition that Julian was killed by [[Saint Mercurius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sozomenus]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 6.2&lt;/ref&gt; Julian was succeeded by the short-lived Emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] who reestablished Christianity's privileged position throughout the Empire.

Libanius says in his epitaph of the deceased emperor (18.304) that &quot;I have mentioned representations (of Julian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honour him as they do the gods. Already a blessing has been besought of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from him themselves.&quot; However, no similar action was taken by the Roman central government, which would be more and more dominated by Christians in the ensuing decades.

Considered apocryphal is the report that his dying words were {{lang|grc|''νενίκηκάς με, Γαλιλαῖε''}}, or {{lang|la|''Vicisti, Galilaee''}} (&quot;You have won, [[Jesus|Galilean]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;First recorded by [[Theodoret]], (''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 3.25) in the 5th century.&lt;/ref&gt; supposedly expressing his recognition that, with his death, [[Christianity]] would become the Empire's state religion. The phrase introduces the 1866 poem ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'', which was [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s elaboration of what a philosophic pagan might have felt at the triumph of Christianity. It also ends the Polish Romantic play ''The Undivine comedy'' written in 1833 by [[Zygmunt Krasiński]].

===Tomb===
[[Image:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Sarcofagi imperiali bizantini - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Porphyry sarcophagi outside the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. Julian's is the left-hand one.]]

As he had requested, Julian's body was buried in Tarsus.  It lay in a tomb outside the city, across a road from that of Maximinus Daia.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, ''Oration'' 18, 306; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] 23, 2.5 and 25, 5.1.  References from G. Downey,''The tombs of the Byzantine emperors at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople'', Journal of Hellenic Studies 79 (1959) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

However, chronicler [[Zonaras]] says that at some &quot;later&quot; date his body was exhumed and reburied in or near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, where Constantine and the rest of his family lay.&lt;ref&gt;Downey gives the text: '...later the body was transferred to the imperial city' (xiii 13, 25)&lt;/ref&gt;  His sarcophagus is listed as standing in a &quot;stoa&quot; there by [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]].&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Downey, ''The tombs of the Byzantine emperors at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople'', Journal of Hellenic Studies 79 (1959) 27–51.  On p. 34 he states that the ''Book of Ceremonies'' of Constantine Porphyrogenitus gives a list of tombs, ending with: &quot;43. In this ''stoa'', which is to the north, lies a cylindrically-shaped sarcophagus, in which lies the cursed and wretched body of the apostate Julian, porphyry or Roman in colour. 44 Another sarcophagus, porphyry, or Roman, in which lies the body of Jovian, who ruled after Julian.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The church was demolished by the Ottoman Turks after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  Today a sarcophagus of porphyry, identified as Julian's, stands in the grounds of the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul.

==Julian and religious issues==

===Beliefs===
Julian's personal religion was both pagan and philosophical; he viewed the traditional myths as allegories, in which the ancient gods were aspects of [[Neoplatonism#The One|a philosophical divinity]]. The chief surviving sources are his works ''To King [[Helios]]'' and ''To the [[Cybele|Mother of the Gods]]'', which were written as [[panegyric]]s, not theological treatises.

While there are clear resemblances to other forms of Late Antique religion, it is controversial as to which variety it is most similar. He learned [[theurgy]] from [[Maximus of Ephesus]], a student of [[Iamblichus]];&lt;ref&gt;The emperor's study of Iamblichus and of theurgy are a source of criticism from his primary chronicler, Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.13.6–8 and 25.2.5&lt;/ref&gt; his system bears some resemblance to the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]];  Polymnia Athanassiadi has brought new attention to his relations with [[Mithraism]], although whether he was initiated into it remains debatable; and certain aspects of his thought (such as his reorganization of [[paganism]] under High Priests, and his fundamental [[monotheism]]) may show Christian influence. Some of these potential sources have not come down to us, and all of them influenced each other, which adds to the difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shaun |last=Tougher |title=Julian the Apostate |page=27ff, 58f |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780748618873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory (that of [[Glen Bowersock|G.W. Bowersock]] in particular), Julian's paganism was highly eccentric and atypical because it was heavily influenced by an esoteric approach to Platonic [[philosophy]] sometimes identified as ''theurgy'' and also ''Neoplatonism''. Others (Rowland Smith, in particular) have argued that Julian's philosophical perspective was nothing unusual for a &quot;cultured&quot; pagan of his time, and, at any rate, that Julian's paganism was not limited to philosophy alone, and that he was deeply devoted to the same gods and goddesses as other pagans of his day.

Because of his Neoplatonist background Julian accepted the creation of humanity as described in Plato's ''Timaeus''. Julian writes, &quot;when Zeus was setting all things in order there fell from him drops of sacred blood, and from them, as they say, arose the race of men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julian, &quot;Letter to a Priest&quot;, 292. Transl. W.C. Wright, v.2, p.307.&lt;/ref&gt; Further he writes, &quot;they who had the power to create one man and one woman only, were able to create many men and women at once...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;As above. Wright, v.2, p.305.&lt;/ref&gt; His view contrasts with the Christian belief that humanity is derived from the one pair, Adam and Eve. Elsewhere he argues against the single pair origin, indicating his disbelief, noting for example, &quot;how very different in their bodies are the Germans and Scythians from the Libyans and Ethiopians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julian, &quot;[[Libri tres contra Galileos|Against the Galilaeans]]&quot;, 143. Transl. W.C. Wright, v.3, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Gossett, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'',  1963 (Southern Methodist University Press) /1997 (Oxford University Press, USA), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]] was of the opinion that Julian believed himself to be [[Alexander the Great]] &quot;in another body&quot; via [[reincarnation|transmigration]] of [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, &quot;in accordance with the teachings of [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', iii, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diet of Julian is said to have been predominantly vegetable-based.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of Paganism as state religion===
[[Image:Edward Armitage - Julian the Apostate presiding at a conference of sectarian - 1875.jpg|thumb|200px|''Julian the Apostate presiding at a conference of sectarians'', by [[Edward Armitage]], 1875]]
{{See also|henosis|henotheism}}
After gaining the purple, Julian started a religious reformation of the state, which was intended to restore the lost strength of the Roman state. He supported the restoration of [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic]] polytheism as the state religion. His laws tended to target wealthy and educated Christians, and his aim was not to destroy Christianity but to drive the religion out of &quot;the governing classes of the empire&amp;nbsp;— much as [[Buddhism]] was driven back into the lower classes by a revived [[Confucian]] mandarinate in [[Culture of the Song Dynasty|13th century China]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;Brown, Peter, ''The World of Late Antiquity'', W. W. Norton, New York, 1971, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

He restored pagan temples which had been confiscated since Constantine's time, or simply appropriated by wealthy citizens; he repealed the stipends that Constantine had awarded to Christian bishops, and removed their other privileges, including a right to be consulted on appointments and to act as private courts. He also reversed some favors that had previously been given to Christians.  For example, he reversed Constantine's declaration that Majuma, the port of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], was a separate [[polis|city]]. Majuma had a large Christian congregation while Gaza was still predominantly pagan.

On 4 February 362, Julian promulgated an edict to guarantee freedom of religion. This edict proclaimed that all the religions were equal before the law, and that the Roman Empire had to return to its original religious eclecticism, according to which the Roman state did not impose any religion on its provinces.  Practically however, it had as its purpose the restoration of paganism at the expense of Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Image:Saint Mercurius killing Iulian.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Copt]]ic [[icon]] showing [[Saint Mercurius]] killing Julian. According to a tradition, [[Saint Basil]] (an old school-mate of Julian) had been imprisoned at the start of Julian's Sassanid campaign. Basil prayed to Mercurius to help him, and the saint appeared in a vision to Basil, claiming to have speared Julian to death.]]

Since the persecution of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian's actions were designed to harass and undermine the ability of Christians to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Persecution&quot;&gt;Julian, ''Epistulae'', 52.436A ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus' theurgy seems to have convinced him that it was right to outlaw the practice of the Christian view of theurgy and demand the suppression of the Christian set of Mysteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theurgy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Julian%27s+preference+for+a+non-Christian+and+non-philosophical+view+of+Iamblichus%27+theurgy|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|author=Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman|year=1992|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''School Edict'' Julian required that all public teachers be approved by the Emperor; the state paid or supplemented much of their salaries. Ammianus Marcellinus explains this as intending to prevent Christian teachers from using pagan texts (such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was widely regarded as divinely inspired) that formed the core of classical education: &quot;If they want to learn literature, they have [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]: Let them go back to their churches and expound on them&quot;, the edict says.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; This was an attempt to remove some of the power of the Christian schools which at that time and later used ancient Greek literature in their teachings in their effort to present the Christian religion as being superior to paganism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  The edict was also a severe financial blow, because it deprived Christian scholars, tutors and teachers of many students.

In his ''Tolerance Edict'' of 362, Julian decreed the reopening of pagan temples, the restitution of confiscated temple properties, and the return from exile of dissident Christian bishops. The latter was an instance of tolerance of different religious views, but it may also have been seen as an attempt by Julian to foster schisms and divisions between different Christian sects, since conflict between rival Christian sects was quite fierce.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.5.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

His care in the institution of a pagan hierarchy in opposition to that of the Christians was due to his wish to create a society in which every aspect of the life of the citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor&amp;nbsp;— the final provider for all the needs of his people.

====Paganism's shift under Julian====
During Julian’s brief reign from 361–363 CE, his popularity among the people and the army indicated that he might have brought paganism back to the fore of Roman public and private life.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Murdoch, The Last Pagan (UK: Sutton Publishing Limited, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, during his lifetime, neither pagan nor Christian ideology reigned supreme, and the greatest thinkers of the day argued about the merits and rationality of each religion.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Murdoch, The Last Pagan (UK: Sutton Publishing Limited, 2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly for the pagan cause, though, Rome was still a predominantly pagan empire that had not wholly accepted Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Bradbury, &quot;Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice,&quot; Phoenix 49 (1995), 331.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Even so, Julian’s short reign did not stem the tide of Christianity. The emperor’s ultimate failure can arguably be attributed {{according to whom|date=January 2015}} to the manifold religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one ‘pagan religion.’ Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians to lump together the believers of a system they opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Bradbury, &quot;Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice,&quot; Phoenix 49 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, there was no Roman religion, as modern observers would recognize it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Kirsch 2004&quot;&gt;Jonathan Kirsch, God against the Gods (New York: Penguin Group, 2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, paganism came from a system of observances that one historian has characterized as “no more than a spongy mass of tolerance and tradition.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Kirsch 2004&quot;/&gt;

This system of tradition had already shifted dramatically by the time Julian came to power; gone were the days of massive sacrifices honoring the gods. The communal festivals that involved sacrifice and feasting, which once united communities, now tore them apart—Christian against pagan.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Bradbury, &quot;Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice,&quot; Phoenix 49 (1995): 333.&lt;/ref&gt;  Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds)  had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott Bradbury 1995&quot;&gt;Scott Bradbury, &quot;Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice,&quot; Phoenix 49 (1995): 352.&lt;/ref&gt;  In all, Julian’s short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past.  Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation to rock the boat by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Bradbury, &quot;Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice,&quot; Phoenix 49 (1995): 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

After witnessing the reign of two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, it is understandable that{{OR|date=June 2015}} pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian’s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion with some of the same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Mattingly, “The Later Paganism,” The Harvard Theological Review 35 (1942): 178.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott Bradbury 1995&quot;/&gt; Yet Julian’s attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism’s system of tradition.

Indeed, this development of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Mattingly, “The Later Paganism,” The Harvard Theological Review 35 (1942): 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Julian’s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;James O’Donnell, “The Demise of Paganism,” Traditio 35 (1979): 53, accessed September 23, 2014, http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/stable/27831060.&lt;/ref&gt; In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally changed the nature of pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had been only a system of tradition.

====Juventinus and Maximus====
Despite the emperor's attempts to reconcile Christianity and paganism, many of the Church fathers viewed him with hostility, and told stories of his supposed wickedness after his death.  A sermon by Saint [[John Chrysostom]], entitled ''On Saints [[Juventinus and Maximinus]],'' tells the story of two of Julian's soldiers at Antioch, who were overheard at a drinking party, criticizing the emperor's religious policies, and taken into custody.  According to John, the emperor had made a deliberate effort to avoid creating martyrs of those who disagreed with his reforms; but Juventinus and Maximinus admitted to being Christians, and refused to moderate their stance.  John asserts that the emperor forbade anyone from having contact with the men, but that nobody obeyed his orders; so he had the two men executed in the middle of the night.  John urges his audience to visit the tomb of these martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;St. [[John Chrysostom]], ''The Cult of the Saints'' (select homilies and letters), Wendy Mayer &amp; Bronwen Neil, eds., St. Vladimir's Seminary Press (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charity====
Because Christian [[Charitable organization|charities]] were open to all, including pagans, it put this aspect of the Roman citizens lives out of the control of the Imperial authority and under that of the Church.  Thus Julian envisioned the institution of a Roman philanthropic system, and cared for the behaviour and the morality of the pagan priests, in the hope that it would mitigate the reliance of pagans on Christian charity, saying: ''&quot;These impious Galileans not only feed their own poor, but ours also; welcoming them into their [[Agape feast|agapae]], they attract them, as children are attracted, with cakes.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in :

===Attempt to rebuild the Jewish Temple===
In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Persia, in keeping with his effort to foster religions other than Christianity, he ordered the Temple rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  A personal friend of his, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], wrote this about the effort:

{{quote|text=Julian thought to rebuild at an extravagant expense the proud Temple once at Jerusalem, and committed this task to [[Alypius of Antioch]]. Alypius set vigorously to work, and was seconded by the [[Roman governor|governor of the province]]; when fearful balls of fire, breaking out near the foundations, continued their attacks, till the workmen, after repeated scorchings, could approach no more: and he gave up the attempt.}}

The failure to rebuild the Temple has been ascribed to the [[Galilee earthquake of 363]], and to the [[Jew]]s' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire.  Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html &quot;Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE&quot;] (Fordham University, The Jesuit University of New York) and [http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html &quot;Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's support of [[Judaism|Jews]] caused Jews to call him &quot;Julian the [[Names of the Greeks#Hellene comes to mean .22pagan.22|Hellene]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, [[Avner Falk]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious works contain involved philosophical speculations, and the [[panegyrics]] to Constantius are formulaic and elaborate in style.

The ''[[Misopogon]]'' (or &quot;Beard Hater&quot;) is a light-hearted account of his clash with the inhabitants of Antioch after he was mocked for his beard and generally scruffy appearance for an Emperor. ''The Caesars'' is a humorous tale of a contest between some of the most notable Roman Emperors: [[Julius Caesar]], [[Augustus]], [[Trajan]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], Constantine, and also interestingly [[Alexander the Great]]. This was a satiric attack upon the recent Constantine, whose worth, both as a Christian and as the leader of the Roman Empire, Julian severely questions.

One of the most important of his lost works is his ''Against the Galileans'', intended to refute the Christian religion. The only parts of this work which survive are those excerpted by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who gives extracts from the three first books in his refutation of Julian, ''Contra Julianum''. These extracts do not give an adequate idea of the work: Cyril confesses that he had not ventured to copy several of the weightiest arguments.

These have been edited and translated several times since the Renaissance, most often separately; but all are translated in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition of 1913, edited by Wilmer Cave Wright.

==In fiction==
* In 1847, the controversial German theologian [[David Friedrich Strauss]] published in [[Mannheim]] the pamphlet ''Der Romantiker auf dem Thron der Cäsaren'' (&quot;A Romantic on the Throne of the Caesars&quot;), in which Julian was satirised as &quot;an unworldly dreamer, a man who turned nostalgia for the ancients into a way of life and whose eyes were closed to the pressing needs of the present&quot;. In fact, this was a veiled criticism of the contemporary King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]], known for his romantic dreams of restoring the supposed glories of feudal Medieval society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Clark]], &quot;Iron Kingdom&quot;, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;
* Julian's life inspired the play ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]].
* Julian's life and reign were the subject of the novel ''[[The Death of the Gods]] (Julian the Apostate)'' (1895) in the trilogy of historical novels entitled &quot;Christ and Antichrist&quot; (1895–1904) by the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] poet, novelist and literary theoretician [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky|Dmitrii S. Merezhkovskii]].
* The opera ''Der Apostat'' (1924) by the composer and conductor [[Felix Weingartner]] is about Julian.
* In 1945 [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] authored the tragedy ''Julian the Apostate'' in which the emperor is depicted as an existentialist hero committed to a struggle which he knows will be in vain. It was first staged in Paris in 1948.
* Julian was the subject of a novel, ''[[Julian (historical novel)|Julian]]'' (1964), by [[Gore Vidal]], describing his life and times. It is notable for, among other things, its scathing critique of Christianity.
* Julian appeared in ''Gods and Legions'', by [[Michael Curtis Ford]] (2002). Julian's tale was told by his closest companion, the Christian saint [[Caesarius of Nazianzus|Caesarius]], and accounts for the transition from a Christian philosophy student in Athens to a pagan Roman Augustus of the old nature.
* Julian's letters are an important part of the symbolism of [[Michel Butor]]'s novel ''[[La Modification]]''.
* The fantasy [[alternate history]] ''[[The Dragon Waiting]]'' by [[John M. Ford]], while set in the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]], uses the reign of Julian as its [[point of divergence]]. His reign not being cut short, he was successful in disestablishing Christianity and restoring a religiously eclectic societal order which survived the fall of Rome and into the [[Renaissance]] Characters in the novel refer to him as &quot;Julian the Wise&quot;.
*The [[dystopian]] [[speculative fiction]] novel ''[[Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America]]'' parallels the life of Julian, with the title character as the hereditary president of an oligarchic future United States of America who tries to restore science and combat the fundamentalist Christianity that has taken over the country.

[[File:Carinus RIC 157c obv.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Antoninianus]] of Emperor Carinus]]
'''Carinus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Carinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Carinus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS CARINVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; died 285) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 282 to 285. The elder son of emperor [[Carus]], he was first appointed ''Caesar'' and in the beginning of 283 co-emperor of the western portion of the empire by his father.  Official accounts of his character and career have been filtered through the propaganda of his successful opponent, [[Diocletian]].

==Reign==
He fought with success against the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribes,&lt;ref name =&quot;leadbetter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Carinus (283–285 A.D.) |last= Leadbetter|first= William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=|publisher= |location= |isbn= |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/carinus.htm |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon left the defence of the Upper [[Rhine]] to his legates and returned to [[Rome]], where the surviving accounts, which demonize him, assert that he abandoned himself to all kinds of debauchery and excess. More certainly, he celebrated the annual ''[[ludi Romani]]'' on a scale of unexampled magnificence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Christianity and Paganism |last= Spence|first= H. Donald M.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7661-3068-1 |url= |pages=391–392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After the death of Carus, the army in the east demanded to return to Europe, and [[Numerian]], the younger son of Carus, was forced to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine |last= Southern|first= Pat|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001|publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-23944-3|url= |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a halt at [[Chalcedon]], Numerian was found dead. [[Diocletian]], commander of the body-guards, claimed that Numerian had been assassinated, and he was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Constantine|last= Pohlsander|first=Hans A.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location= |isbn=0-415-31938-2|url= |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Carinus left Rome at once and set out for the east to meet Diocletian. On his way through Pannonia he put down the usurper [[Sabinus Iulianus]] and in July 285 he encountered the army of Diocletian at the Margus River in [[Moesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leadbetter&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

=== Death in 285 ===

Historians differ on what then ensued. At the [[Battle of the Margus|Battle of the Margus River]] ([[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava]]), according to one account, the valour of his troops had gained the day, but Carinus was assassinated by a tribune whose wife he had seduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;leadbetter&quot;/&gt; Another account represents the battle as resulting in a complete victory for Diocletian, and Carinus' army deserted him. This account may be confirmed by the fact that Diocletian kept in service Carinus' [[Praetorian Guard]] commander, [[Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leadbetter&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

=== Character ===

Carinus has a reputation as one of the worst Roman emperors. This infamy may have been supported by Diocletian himself. For example, the (unreliable) ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' has Carinus marrying nine wives, while neglecting to mention his only real wife, [[Magnia Urbica]], by whom he had a son, Marcus Aurelius Nigrinianus.

After his death, Carinus' memory was officially condemned in the Roman proceeding known as [[Damnatio Memoriae]]. His name, along with that of his wife, was erased from inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mutilation and Transformation : Damnatio Memoriae and Roman Imperial Portraiture |last= Varner|first= Eric R.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004|publisher= [[Brill Academic Publishers]] |location= |isbn= 90-04-13577-4|url=|page= 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Numerian''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Numerius Numerianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Numerian's name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS NVMERIVS NVMERIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; died November 284) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 282 to 284 with his older brother [[Carinus]]. They were sons of [[Carus]], a general raised to the office of [[praetorian prefect]] under Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] in 282.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leadbetter, Carus.&quot;&gt;Leadbetter, &quot;Carus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
In 282, the legions of the upper Danube in [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] proclaimed as emperor Numerian's father, the [[praetorian prefect]] Marcus Aurelius [[Carus]], beginning a rebellion against the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Carus&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Southern, ''Severus to Constantine'', p. 132; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Probus' army, stationed in [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]), decided they did not wish to fight Carus and assassinated Probus instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Southern, ''Severus to Constantine'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Carus, already sixty, wished to establish a dynasty&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Southern, ''Severus to Constantine'', p. 132; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately elevated Carinus and Numerian to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 283, Carus left Carinus in charge of the West and moved with Numerian and his praetorian prefect [[Arrius Aper]] to the East to wage war against the [[Sassanid Empire]]. The Sassanids had been embroiled in a succession dispute since the death of Shapur and were in no position to oppose Carus' advance.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, &quot;Carus&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], and [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], Carus won a major victory against the Persians, taking [[Seleucia]] and the Sassanid capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (near modern [[Al-Mada'in]], [[Iraq]]), cities on opposite banks of the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12.30; Eutropius, 9.14.1; Festus, 24; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Carus&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 279; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In celebration, Numerian, Carus, and Carinus all took the [[Victory title#Roman victory titles|title]] ''Persici maximi''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Carus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Carus died in July or early August of 283,&lt;ref name=&quot;Leadbetter, Carus.&quot;/&gt; possibly due to a strike of lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Carus&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Southern, ''Severus to Constantine'', p. 133; Williams, ''Diocletian'', pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numerian and Carinus as Augusti ===
The death of Carus left Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from Gaul, arriving in January 284, while Numerian lingered in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNSCE4&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman retreat from Persia was orderly and unopposed, for the Persian King, [[Bahram II]], was still struggling to establish his authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSC133&quot;&gt;Southern, ''Severus to Constantine'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa ([[Homs]]) in [[Syria]]; by November, only [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health, as he issued the only extant [[rescript]] in his name there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' 5.52.2; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus&quot;; Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Coins were issued in his name in [[Cyzicus]] at some time before the end of 284, but it is impossible to know whether he was still in the public eye by that point.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 5.2 Numerian no. 462; Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', pp. 279–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

After Emesa, Numerian's staff, including the prefect Aper, reported that Numerian suffered from an inflammation of the eyes and had to travel in a closed coach.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When the army reached [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BNSCE4&quot;/&gt; some of Numerian's soldiers smelled an odor reminiscent of a decaying corpse emanating from the coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSC133&quot;/&gt; They opened its curtains and found Numerian dead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', p. 39; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Numerian's death ===
Aper officially broke the news of Numerian's death in [[Nicomedia]] ([[İzmit]]) in November 284.&lt;ref name = &quot;P280&quot;/&gt; Numerian's generals and tribunes called a council for the succession and chose as emperor [[Diocletian]], commander of the cavalry arm of the imperial bodyguard,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 4; Barnes, ''New Empire'', p. 31; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian&quot;, p. 68; Mathisen, &quot;Diocletian&quot;; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 33, 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; despite Aper's attempts to garner support.&lt;ref name=&quot;P280&quot;&gt;Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The army of the east gathered on a hill outside of Nicomedia&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, pp. 4&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', pp. 4–5; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', pp. 39–40; Williams, ''Diocletian'', pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  and unanimously saluted their new Augustus. Diocletian accepted the purple imperial vestments and raised his sword to the light of the sun, swearing an oath denying responsibility for Numerian's death. He asserted that Aper had killed Numerian and concealed the deed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, pp. 4&quot;/&gt; In full view of the army, turned and killed Aper.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', pp. 4–5; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerian&quot;; Odahl, ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', pp. 39–40; Williams, ''Diocletian'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character ==
According to the unreliable ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', Numerian was a man of considerable literary attainments, remarkably amiable, and known as a great orator and poet. No other sources, however, report anything about his personality.

'''Diocletian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|k|l|iː|ʃ|ən}}; {{lang-la|Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus Augustus}}), born '''Diocles''' (245–311),&lt;ref name=DEATH&gt;Barnes, &quot;Lactantius and Constantine&quot;, 32–35; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Empire'', 30, 46; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman emperor]] from 284 to 305. Born to a family of low status in the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor [[Carus]]. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]]. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286.

Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or &quot;rule of four&quot;, each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favorable peace. 

Diocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Antioch]], and [[Trier]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.

Not all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and [[Constantine I|Constantine]], sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of [[Christianity]], did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324 Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]].

In spite of these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another hundred years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].

==Early life==
[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]
Diocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.&lt;ref name=BIRTH/&gt; His parents named him Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate. Other historians are not so certain.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 30; Williams, 237–38; cf. Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 86: &quot;We do not even know when he was born ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Diocles' parents were of low status, and writers critical of him claimed that his father was a [[scribe]] or a [[freedman]] of the senator Anullinus, or even that Diocles was a freedman himself. The first forty years of his life are mostly obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 68; Potter, 280; Williams, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chronicler [[John Zonaras]] states that he was ''[[Dux]] [[Moesia]]e'',&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12.31; Southern, 331; Williams, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; a commander of forces on the lower [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathisen, &quot;Diocletian&quot;; Williams, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The often-unreliable ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' states that he served in Gaul, but this account is not corroborated by other sources and is ignored by modern historians of the period.&lt;ref&gt;''SHA'', ''Vita Carini'' 14–15; Williams, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Diocletian's whereabouts are accurately established, in 282, he was made by the newly Emperor [[Carus]] commander of the ''Protectores domestici'', the élite cavalry force directly attached to the Imperial household – a post that earned him the honor of a consulship in 283.&lt;ref&gt;Williams,33&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he took part in Carus' subsequent Persian campaign.

===Death of Numerian===
Carus's death, amid a successful war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; – he was believed (perhaps as a result of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mommsen, ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''. London: Routledge, 1999, page 348. Mommsen offers a general remark on the political history of the Third Century Rome: &quot;Those accounts we do possess stem from outsiders who in fact know nothing&quot; – 346. A modern historian like  Jill Harries, ''Imperial Rome AD 284 to 363: The New Empire'',Edinburgh University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-7486-2052-4 , page 27, calls Carus's death account, outrightly, a &quot;story&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new ''Augusti''. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East.&lt;ref name=BNSCE4&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed.&lt;ref name=SSC133&gt;Southern, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sassanid]] king [[Bahram II]] could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached [[Homs|Emesa (Homs)]] in [[Syria]]; by November, only Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant [[rescript]] in his name there,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' 5.52.2; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus&quot;; Potter, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Coins are issued in his name in [[Cyzicus]] at some time before the end of 284, but it is impossible to know whether he was still in the public eye by that point.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 5.2 Numerian no. 462; Potter, 279–80.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage)&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Flavius Aper|Aper]], reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When the army reached [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref name=BNSCE4/&gt; some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach.&lt;ref name=SSC133/&gt; They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerianus&quot;; Odahl, 39; Williams, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and [[Aurelius Victor]] describe Numerian's death as a murder.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Breviarium'', 9.19; Aurelius Victor, ''Book of the Caesars'', 39.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aper officially broke the news in [[Nicomedia]] ([[İzmit]]) in November.&lt;ref name=P280/&gt; Numerianus' generals and tribunes called a council for the succession, and chose Diocles as Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (''CAH''), 68; Williams, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of Aper's attempts to garner support.&lt;ref name=P280/&gt; On 20 November 284, the army of the east gathered on a hill {{convert|5|km|mi}} outside Nicomedia. The army unanimously saluted Diocles as their new augustus, and he accepted the purple imperial vestments. He raised his sword to the light of the sun and swore an oath disclaiming responsibility for Numerian's death. He asserted that Aper had killed Numerian and concealed it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4–5; Odahl, 39–40; Williams, 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In full view of the army, Diocles drew his sword and killed Aper.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 4–5; Leadbetter, &quot;Numerian&quot;; Odahl, 39–40; Williams, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Historia Augusta'', he quoted from [[Virgil]] while doing so.&lt;ref&gt;''SHA'', ''Vita Cari'' 13, cited in Averil Cameron, ''The Later Roman Empire'' (Glasgow: Fontana, 1993), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Aper's death, Diocles changed his name to the more Latinate &quot;Diocletianus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; in full Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 31; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 68–69; Potter, 280; Southern, 134; Williams, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Carinus===
[[File:Montemartini - Carino 1030439.JPG|thumb|upright|Head of [[Carinus]] at the [[Centrale Montemartini]]]]
After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus&lt;ref&gt;Fully, L. Caesonius Ovinius Manlius Rufinianus Bassus.&lt;/ref&gt; were named as consuls and assumed the ''[[fasces]]'' in place of Carinus and Numerianus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Potter, 280; Southern, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassus was a member of a [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] family from [[Campania]], a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction.&lt;ref name=BNSCE5/&gt; He was skilled in areas of government where Diocletian presumably had no experience.&lt;ref name=P280/&gt; Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, his refusal to accept second-tier status to any other emperor,&lt;ref name=BNSCE5/&gt; and his willingness to continue the long-standing collaboration between the empire's senatorial and military aristocracies.&lt;ref name=P280/&gt; It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.&lt;ref name=BNSCE5/&gt;

Diocletian was not the only challenger to Carinus' rule: the usurper [[Sabinus Iulianus|M. Aurelius Julianus]], Carinus' ''corrector Venetiae'', took control of northern [[Italy]] and [[Pannonia]] after Diocletian's accession.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus&quot;; Southern, 134–35; Williams, 38. See also Banchich.&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus minted coins from the mint at Siscia ([[Sisak]], Croatia) declaring himself as emperor and promising freedom. It was all good publicity for Diocletian, and it aided in his portrayal of Carinus as a cruel and oppressive tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 134–5; Williams, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus' forces were weak, however, and were handily dispersed when Carinus' armies moved from Britain to northern Italy. As leader of the united East, Diocletian was clearly the greater threat.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Over the winter of 284–85, Diocletian advanced west across the [[Balkans]]. In the spring, some time before the end of May,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Potter, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; his armies met Carinus' across the river Margus ([[Great Morava]]) in [[Moesia]]. In modern accounts, the site has been located between the Mons Aureus (Seone, west of [[Smederevo]]) and [[Viminacium]],&lt;ref name=BNSCE5&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; near modern [[Belgrade]], Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Odahl, 40; Southern, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having the stronger, more powerful army, Carinus held the weaker position. His rule was unpopular, and it was later alleged that he had mistreated the Senate and seduced his officers' wives.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Williams, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], the governor of Dalmatia and Diocletian's associate in the household guard, had already defected to Diocletian in the early spring.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 280; Williams, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Battle of the Margus]] began, Carinus' prefect [[Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus|Aristobulus]] also defected.&lt;ref name=P280/&gt; In the course of the battle, Carinus was killed by his own men. Following Diocletian's victory, both the western and the eastern armies acclaimed him augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Odahl, 40; Williams, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian exacted an oath of allegiance from the defeated army and departed for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 135; Williams, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early rule==
Diocletian may have become involved in battles against the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] immediately after the Battle of the Margus. He eventually made his way to northern Italy and made an imperial government, but it is not known whether he visited the city of Rome at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a contemporary issue of coins suggestive of an imperial ''[[adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' (arrival) for the city,&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 5.2.241 no. 203–04; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5, 287; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt; but some modern historians state that Diocletian avoided the city, and that he did so on principle, as the city and its Senate were no longer politically relevant to the affairs of the empire and needed to be taught as much. Diocletian dated his reign from his elevation by the army, not the date of his ratification by the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; following the practice established by Carus, who had declared the Senate's ratification a useless formality.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''De Cesaribus'', 37.5, quoted in Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 654&lt;/ref&gt; However, Diocletian was to offer proof of his deference towards the Senate by retaining Aristobulus as ordinary consul and colleague for 285 (one of the few instances during the Late Empire in which an emperor admitted a ''privatus'' as his colleague)&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality''. [[Cornell University Press]], 1998, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and by creating senior senators Vettius Aqulinus and Junius Maximus ordinary consuls for the following year – for Maximus, it was his second consulship.&lt;ref&gt;William Lewis     Leadbetter, ''Galerius and the Will of Diocletian''. Abingdon: 2011, n.p.g. (e-book)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, if Diocletian ever did enter Rome shortly after his accession, he did not stay long;&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 135, 331.&lt;/ref&gt; he is attested back in the Balkans by 2 November 285, on campaign against the [[Sarmatians]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian replaced the [[Praefectus urbis|prefect]] of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials who had served under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5–6; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 113; Williams, 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In an act of ''clementia'' denoted by the epitomator [[Aurelius Victor]] as unusual,&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, 39.15, qtd. in Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Two Senators,&quot; 46; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5–6; Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus&quot;; Southern, 135; Williams, 41&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Two Senators,&quot; 46; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5–6; Leadbetter, &quot;Carinus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximian made co-emperor===
[[File:IMP MAXIMIANVS P AVG.gif|thumb|Maximian's consistent loyalty to Diocletian proved an important component of the tetrarchy's early successes.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The assassinations of [[Aurelian]] and Probus demonstrated that sole rulership was dangerous to the stability of the empire.&lt;ref name=P280&gt;Potter, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the lower Danube. It was too much for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Southern, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; At some time in 285 at [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]),{{refn|Barnes and Bowman argue for 21 July,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; ''New Empire'', 4; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Potter for 25 July.&lt;ref&gt;''The Roman Empire at Bay'', 280–81.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=notes}} Diocletian raised his fellow-officer [[Maximian]] to the office of [[Caesar (title)|caesar]], making him co-emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Bleckmann; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Potter, 280–81; Williams, 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of dual rulership was nothing new to the Roman Empire. [[Augustus]], the first Emperor, had nominally shared power with his colleagues, and more formal offices of Co-Emperor had existed from [[Marcus Aurelius]] on.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40. See also: Williams, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Emperor Carus and his sons had ruled together, albeit unsuccessfully. Diocletian was in a less comfortable position than most of his predecessors, as he had a daughter, Valeria, but no sons. His co-ruler had to be from outside his family, raising the question of trust.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 280; Southern, 136; Williams, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians state that Diocletian adopted Maximian as his ''filius Augusti'', his &quot;Augustan son&quot;, upon his appointment to the throne, following the precedent of some previous Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Odahl, 42–43; Southern, 136; Williams, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has not been universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Southern, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Diocletian and Maximian was quickly couched in religious terms. Around 287 Diocletian assumed the title ''Iovius'', and Maximian assumed the title ''Herculius''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 70–71; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Liebeschuetz, 235–52, 240–43; Odahl, 43–44; Williams, 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles were probably meant to convey certain characteristics of their associated leaders. Diocletian, in [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jovian]] style, would take on the dominating roles of planning and commanding; Maximian, in [[Hercules|Herculian]] mode, would act as Jupiter's [[hero]]ic subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11–12; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 70–71; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Odahl, 43; Southern, 136–37; Williams, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; For all their religious connotations, the emperors were not &quot;gods&quot; in the tradition of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]—although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial [[panegyric]]s. Instead, they were seen as the gods' representatives, effecting their will on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11; Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from military acclamation to divine sanctification took the power to appoint emperors away from the army. Religious legitimization elevated Diocletian and Maximian above potential rivals in a way military power and dynastic claims could not.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 58–59. See also: Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Sarmatia and Persia===
After his acclamation, Maximian was dispatched to fight the rebel [[Bagaudae]], insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Southern, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2 November, he had only reached Citivas Iovia (Botivo, near [[Ptuj]], [[Slovenia]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 4.48.5; ''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 297; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 50; Potter, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of [[Sarmatians]] who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, but was unable to secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the [[European Plain]] remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 143; Williams, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian wintered in [[Nicomedia]].{{refn|He is placed there by a rescript dated 3 March 286.&lt;ref&gt;''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 275; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Potter, 281, 649.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} There may have been a revolt in the eastern provinces at this time, as he brought settlers from [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] to populate emptied farmlands in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5)21.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited [[Syria Palaestina]] the following spring, {{refn|He is attested there in a rescript dated 31 May 287.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 4.10.3; 1.51.1; 5.17.3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 50–51; Potter, 281, 649.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Midrash suggests that Diocletian resided at Panias (present-day Banias) in the northern Golan Heights.&lt;ref&gt;Bereishis Rabbah, Ed. Vilna, Parashas Toledos 63:8.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} His stay in the East saw diplomatic success in the conflict with Persia: in 287, [[Bahram II]] granted him precious gifts, declared open friendship with the Empire, and invited Diocletian to visit him.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Millar, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman sources insist that the act was entirely voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, perhaps in 287,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 51; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Persia relinquished claims on [[Armenia]] and recognized Roman authority over territory to the west and south of the Tigris. The western portion of Armenia was incorporated into the empire and made a province. [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] claimant to the Armenian throne and Roman client, had been disinherited and forced to take refuge in the empire after the Persian conquest of 252–53. In 287, he returned to lay claim to the eastern half of his ancestral domain and encountered no opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 73; Potter, 292, 651; Southern, 143; Williams, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Bahram II's gifts were widely recognized as symbolic of a victory in the ongoing [[Roman-Persian Wars|conflict with Persia]], and Diocletian was hailed as the &quot;founder of eternal peace&quot;. The events might have represented a formal end to Carus' eastern campaign, which probably ended without an acknowledged peace.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 242, 360–61.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of discussions with the Persians, Diocletian re-organized the Mesopotamian frontier and fortified the city of [[Circesium]] (Buseire, Syria) on the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 73; Millar, 180–81; Southern, 143; Williams, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximian made Augustus===
Maximian's campaigns were not proceeding as smoothly. The Bagaudae had been easily suppressed, but [[Carausius]], the man he had put in charge of operations against [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Piracy|pirates]] on the [[Saxon Shore]], had, according to literary sources, begun keeping the goods seized from the pirates for himself. Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul into open revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6–7; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 70–71; Potter, 283–84; Southern, 137–41; Williams, 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more probable, according to the archaeological evidence available, is that Carausius probably had held some important military post in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 138&lt;/ref&gt; and had already a firm basis of power on both Britain and Northern Gaul (a coin hoard found in [[Rouen]] proves that he was in control of that mainland area at the beginning of his rebellion) and that he profited from the lack of legitimacy of the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 284&lt;/ref&gt; Carausius strove at having his legitimacy as a junior emperor acknowledged by Diocletian: in his coinage (of far better quality than the official one, especially his silver pieces) he extolled the &quot;concord&quot; between him and the central power (PAX AVGGG, &quot;the Peace of the three Augusti&quot;, read one 290 bronze piece, displaying, on the other side, Carausius together with Diocletian and Maximian, with the caption CARAVSIVS ET FRATRES SVI, &quot;Carausius &amp; his brothers&quot; [http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/empires2.htm] ).&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 138 &amp; 140&lt;/ref&gt; However, Diocletian could not allow elbow room to a breakaway regional usurper following on [[Postumus]]'s footprints to enter, solely on his own accord, the imperial college.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 61/62&lt;/ref&gt; So Carausius had to go.

Spurred by the crisis, on 1 April 286,&lt;ref name=AUGGGG&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6–7; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; Potter, 282; Southern, 141–42; Williams, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The chronology of Maximian's appointment as augustus is somewhat uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Southern, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that Maximian was appointed augustus from the beginning of his imperial career, without ever holding the office of caesar;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 281; Southern, 142; following ''De Caesaribus'' 39.17.&lt;/ref&gt; others date the assumption of the Augustan title to 1 March 286.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 69; following ''BGU'' 4.1090.34.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 April 286 is the most common date used in modern histories of the period.&lt;ref name=AUGGGG/&gt;|group=notes}} Maximian took up the title of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bleckmann; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Potter, 282; Southern, 141–42; Williams, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment is unusual in that it was impossible for Diocletian to have been present to witness the event. It has even been suggested that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 649.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian to act with a certain amount of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 282; Williams, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian closer to him, by making him his empowered associate, in order to avoid the possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoninianus Carausius leg4-RIC 0069v.jpg|thumb|left|Carausius, rebel emperor of [[Roman Britain]]. Most of the evidence for Carausius' reign comes from his coinage, which was of generally fine quality.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress the rogue commander, so in 287 he campaigned solely against tribes beyond the [[Rhine]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 71; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; As Carausius was allied to the Franks, Maximian's campaigns could be seen as an effort to deny the separatist emperor in Britain a basis of support on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 62&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, as Maximian prepared a fleet for an expedition against Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East to meet Maximian. The two emperors agreed on a joint campaign against the [[Alamanni]]. Diocletian invaded Germania through Raetia while Maximian progressed from Mainz. Each emperor burned crops and food supplies as he went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31; Southern, 142–43; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men added territory to the empire and allowed Maximian to continue preparations against Carausius without further disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Southern, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to the East, Diocletian managed what was probably another rapid campaign against the resurgent Sarmatians. No details survive, but surviving inscriptions indicate that Diocletian took the title ''Sarmaticus Maximus'' after 289.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 255; Southern, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, Diocletian engaged in diplomacy with desert tribes in the regions between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] [[sphere of influence]],&lt;ref name=ubdeze&gt;Potter, 285.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; No details survive for these events.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably in the early spring of 290. The [[panegyric|panegyrist]] who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5)12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7, 288; Potter, 284–85, 650; Southern, 143; Williams, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; but this might simply have been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 143; Williams, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290,&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 9.41.9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 51; Potter, 285, 650.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 6.30.6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 52; Potter, 285, 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian met Maximian in Milan in the winter of 290–91, either in late December 290 or January 291.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 52; Potter, 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was undertaken with a sense of solemn pageantry. The emperors spent most of their time in public appearances. It has been surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague.&lt;ref name=ubdeze/&gt; A deputation from the Roman Senate met with the emperors, renewing its infrequent contact with the Imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)2.4, 8.1, 11.3–4, 12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8, 288; Potter, 285, 650; Williams, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of Milan over Rome further snubbed the capital's pride. But then it was already a long established practice that Rome itself was only a ceremonial capital, as the actual seat of the Imperial administration was determined by the needs of defense. Long before Diocletian, [[Gallienus]] (r. 253–68) had chosen Milan as the seat of his headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsner, Imperial Rome, 73&quot;&gt;Elsner, ''Imperial Rome'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; If the panegyric detailing the ceremony implied that the true center of the empire was not Rome, but where the emperor sat (&quot;...the capital of the empire appeared to be there, where the two emperors met&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)12, qtd. in Williams, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; it simply echoed what had already been stated by the historian [[Herodian]] in the early third century: &quot;Rome is where the emperor is&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsner, Imperial Rome, 73&quot;/&gt; During the meeting, decisions on matters of politics and war were probably made in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Potter, 285, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The Augusti would not meet again until 303.&lt;ref name=ubdeze/&gt;

==Tetrarchy==
{{see also|Tetrarchy}}

===Foundation of the Tetrarchy===
[[File:Tetrarchy map3.jpg|thumb|thumb|Map of the Roman Empire under the tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four tetrarchs' zones of influence.]]
[[File:Sbeitla 10.jpg|thumb|Triumphal arch of the tetrarchy, [[Sbeitla]], [[Tunisia]]]]
Some time after his return, and before 293, Diocletian transferred command of the war against Carausius from Maximian to [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], a former Governor of Dalmatia and a man of military experience stretching back to [[Aurelian]]'s campaigns against [[Zenobia]] (272–73). He was Maximian's praetorian prefect in Gaul, and the husband to Maximian's daughter, [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]]. On 1 March 293 at Milan, Maximian gave Constantius the office of caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 36–37; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 293, in either Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]) or Sirmium, Diocletian would do the same for [[Galerius]], husband to Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and perhaps Diocletian's Praetorian Prefect.{{refn|The suggested dates for Galerius' appointment are 1 March and 21 May. There is no consensus on which is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 38; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Constantius was assigned Gaul and Britain. Galerius was assigned Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and responsibility for the eastern borderlands.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Williams, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

This arrangement is called the tetrarchy, from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term meaning &quot;rulership by four&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tetrarchic Emperors were more or less sovereign in their own lands, and they travelled with their own imperial courts, administrators, secretaries, and armies.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 45–46; Williams, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by blood and marriage; Diocletian and Maximian now styled themselves as brothers. The senior Co-Emperors formally adopted Galerius and Constantius as sons in 293. These relationships implied a line of succession. Galerius and Constantius would become Augusti after the departure of Diocletian and Maximian. Maximian's son [[Maxentius]] and Constantius' son [[Constantine I|Constantine]] would then become Caesars. In preparation for their future roles, Constantine and Maxentius were taken to Diocletian's court in Nicomedia.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demise of Carausius' breakaway Roman Empire===

Just before his creation as Caesar, Constantius proceed to cut Carausius from his base of support in Gaul, recovering Boulogne after a hotly fought siege, a success that would result in Carausius being murdered and replaced by his aide [[Allectus]], who would hold out in his Britain stronghold for a further three years&lt;ref&gt;Jill Harries, &quot;Imperial Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; until a two-pronged naval invasion resulted in Allectus' defeat and death at the hands of Constantius' pretorian prefect [[Julius Asclepiodotus]], during  a land battle somewhere  near [[Farnham]]. Constantius himself, after disembarking in the south east, delivered London from a looting party of Frankish deserters in Allectus' pay, something that allowed him to assume the role of liberator of Britain. A famous commemorative medallion depicts a personification of London supplying the victorious Constantius on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 74&lt;/ref&gt; with the legend &lt;small&gt;REDDITOR LUCIS AETERNAE&lt;/small&gt; (''Restorer of the eternal light''). The suppression of this threat to the Tetrarchs' legitimacy allowed both Constantius and Maximian to concentrate on outside threats: by 297 Constantius was back on the Rhine and Maximian engaged in a full-scale African campaign against Frankish pirates and nomads, eventually making a triumphal entry into [[Carthage]] on 10 March 298.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maximian's failure to deal with Carausius and Allectus on his own had jeopardized the position of Maxentius as putative heir to his father's post as Augustus of the West, with Constantius' son Constantine appearing as a rival claimant&lt;ref&gt;Jill Harris, &quot;Imperial Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict in the Balkans and Egypt===
[[File:Philae, Trajan's Kiosk, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|A [[Trajan]]ic temple on the island of [[Philae]], the newly established border between the [[Nobatae]] and [[Blemmyes]] and [[Roman Egypt]]&lt;ref name=BNCE1718/&gt;]]
Diocletian spent the spring of 293 traveling with Galerius from Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]) to [[Byzantium]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]). Diocletian then returned to Sirmium, where he would remain for the following winter and spring. He campaigned against the Sarmatians again in 294, probably in the autumn,&lt;ref name=pymwoj&gt;Odahl, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and won a victory against them. The Sarmatians' defeat kept them from the Danube provinces for a long time. Meanwhile, Diocletian built forts north of the Danube,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17; Williams, 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Aquincum]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), Bononia ([[Vidin]], Bulgaria), Ulcisia Vetera, Castra Florentium, Intercisa ([[Dunaújváros]], Hungary), and Onagrinum ([[Begeč]], Serbia). The new forts became part of a new defensive line called the ''Ripa Sarmatica''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 295 and 296 Diocletian campaigned in the region again, and won a victory over the Carpi in the summer of 296.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17; Odahl, 59; Southern, 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Later during both 299 and 302, as Diocletian was then residing in the East, it was Galerius' turn to campaign victoriously on the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his reign, Diocletian had secured the entire length of the Danube, provided it with forts, bridgeheads, highways, and walled towns, and sent fifteen or more legions to patrol the region; an inscription at [[Sexaginta Prista]] on the Lower Danube extolled restored ''tranquilitas'' at the region.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 164&lt;/ref&gt; The defense came at a heavy cost, but was a significant achievement in an area difficult to defend.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galerius, meanwhile, was engaged during 291–293 in disputes in [[Upper Egypt]], where he suppressed a regional uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 163&lt;/ref&gt; He would return to Syria in 295 to fight the revanchist Persian empire.&lt;ref name=BNSCE17/&gt; Diocletian's attempts to bring the Egyptian tax system in line with Imperial standards stirred discontent, and a revolt swept the region after Galerius' departure.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17. See also Southern, 160, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; The usurper [[Domitius Domitianus|L. Domitius Domitianus]] declared himself Augustus in July or August 297. Much of Egypt, including [[Alexandria]], recognized his rule.&lt;ref name=BNSCE17&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian moved into Egypt to suppress him, first putting down rebels in the [[Thebaid]] in the autumn of 297,&lt;ref name=pymwoj/&gt; then moving on to besiege Alexandria. Domitianus died in December 297,&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio, &quot;Domitius&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; by which time Diocletian had secured control of the Egyptian countryside. Alexandria, however, whose defense was organized under Domitianus' former ''[[Corrector#Roman Antiquity|corrector]]'' [[Achilleus (emperor)|Aurelius Achilleus]], was to hold out until a later date, probably March 298.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17; DiMaio, &quot;Domitius&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bureaucratic affairs were completed during Diocletian's stay:&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17–18; Southern, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, lost the ability to mint independently.&lt;ref name=mjhujr&gt;Southern, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of [[Septimius Severus]], brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Elephantine]].&lt;ref name=mjhujr/&gt; In Nubia, he made peace with the [[Nobatae]] and [[Blemmyes]] tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to [[Philae]] and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met up with Galerius in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=BNCE1718&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Persia===
{{see also|Roman relations with the Parthians and Sassanids|Roman–Persian Wars}}

====Invasion, counterinvasion====
[[File:Diocletianus.jpg|thumb|Military issue coin of Diocletian]]
In 294, [[Narseh]], a son of Shapur who had been passed over for the Sassanid succession, came to power in Persia. Narseh eliminated [[Bahram III]], a young man installed in the wake of Bahram II's death in 293.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 292; Williams, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 294, Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts between the empires, and Diocletian responded with an exchange of ambassadors. Within Persia, however, Narseh was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike kings [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]] (r. 226–41) and [[Shapur I]] (r. 241–72), who had sacked Roman Antioch and skinned the Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] (r. 253–260) to decorate his war temple.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narseh declared war on Rome in 295 or 296.

In a public ceremony at Antioch, the official version of events was clear: Galerius was responsible for the defeat; Diocletian was not. Diocletian publicly humiliated Galerius, forcing him to walk for a mile at the head of the Imperial caravan, still clad in the purple robes of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius 9.24–25; Theophanes, ''anno'' 5793; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 17; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 81; Potter, 292–93.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|It is possible that Galerius' position at the head of the caravan was merely the conventional organization of an imperial progression, designed to show a caesar's deference to his augustus, and not an attempt to humiliate him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

Galerius was reinforced, probably in the spring of 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's Danubian holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 18; Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 81; Millar, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Narseh did not advance from Armenia and Mesopotamia, leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, 178; Potter, ''Roman Empire at Bay'', 293.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Faustus of Byzantium]]'s history refers to a battle that took place after Galerius set up base at [[Satala]] (Sadak, Turkey) in [[Armenia Minor]], when Narseh advanced from his base at Oskha to attack him.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, &quot;Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy&quot; (CAH), 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Other histories of the period do not note these events.|group=notes}} It is unclear if Diocletian was present to assist the campaign; he might have returned to Egypt or Syria.{{refn|Lactantius criticizes Diocletian for his absence from the front,&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 9.6.&lt;/ref&gt; but Southern, dating Diocletian's African campaigns one year earlier than Barnes, places Diocletian on Galerius' southern flank.&lt;ref&gt;''Severus to Constantine'', 151, 335–36.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius' force, to Narseh's disadvantage; the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. In two battles, Galerius won major victories over Narseh. During the [[Battle of Satala (298)|second encounter]], Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 18; Potter, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius continued moving down the Tigris, and took the Persian capital Ctesiphon before returning to Roman territory along the Euphrates.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 18; Millar, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peace negotiations====
Narseh sent an ambassador to Galerius to plead for the return of his wives and children in the course of the war, but Galerius dismissed him.&lt;ref name=BNSCE18/&gt; Serious peace negotiations began in the spring of 299. The ''magister memoriae'' (secretary) of Diocletian and Galerius, Sicorius Probus, was sent to Narseh to present terms.&lt;ref name=BNSCE18&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions of the resulting [[Peace of Nisibis]] were heavy:&lt;ref name=P293&gt;Potter, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; [[Caucasian Iberia]] would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene ([[Sophene]]), Arzanene ([[Aghdznik]]), [[Corduene]] (Carduene), and Zabdicene (near modern [[Hakkâri]], Turkey). These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains|Anti-Taurus]] range; the [[Bitlis]] pass, the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia; and access to the [[Tur Abdin]] plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, 178–79; Potter, ''Roman Empire at Bay'', 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A stretch of land containing the later strategic strongholds of Amida ([[Diyarbakır]], Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman military occupation.&lt;ref name=M178&gt;Millar, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; With these territories, Rome would have an advance station north of Ctesiphon, and would be able to slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region.&lt;ref name=P293/&gt; Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including [[Tigranocerta|Tigranokert]], [[Siirt|Saird]], [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Martyropolis]], [[Bitlis|Balalesa]], [[Bakhchisaray|Moxos]], [[Duhok, Iraq|Daudia]], and Arzan&amp;nbsp;– though under what status is unclear.&lt;ref name=M178/&gt; At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim.&lt;ref name=BNSCE18/&gt; Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of [[Syriac Christianity]] from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.&lt;ref name=P293/&gt;

==Religious persecutions==
{{further|Diocletianic Persecution}}

===Early persecutions===
At the conclusion of the [[Peace of Nisibis]], Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of [[sacrifice]] and [[divination]] in an attempt to predict the future. The [[haruspex|haruspices]] were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.1–5; Barnes, &quot;Sossianus Hierocles&quot;, 245; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 18–19; Burgess, &quot;Date of the Persecution&quot;, 157–58; Helgeland, &quot;Christians and the Roman Army&quot;, 159; Liebeschuetz, 246–8; Odahl, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 51; Odahl, 54–56, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Lactantius]] and [[Constantine I|Constantine]] state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.6, 31.1; Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' 8, a1, 3; Constantine, ''Oratio ad Coetum Sanctum'' 22; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 19, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.&lt;ref name=BCE19&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioch was Diocletian's primary residence from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped places with his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 49; Carrié &amp; Roussele, ''L'Empire Romain'', 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=BCE19/&gt; Following some public disputes with [[Manichaeism|Manicheans]], Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus ([[Marmara Island]], Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 660; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 33.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20; Williams, 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 78–79, 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Persecution===
Diocletian returned to Antioch in the autumn of 302. He ordered that the [[deacon]] [[Romanus of Caesarea]] have his tongue removed for defying the order of the courts and interrupting official sacrifices. Romanus was then sent to prison, where he was executed on 17 November 303. Diocletian believed that Romanus of Caesarea was arrogant, and he left the city for Nicomedia in the winter, accompanied by Galerius.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lactantius, Diocletian and Galerius entered into an argument over imperial policy towards Christians while wintering at Nicomedia in 302. Diocletian argued that forbidding Christians from the bureaucracy and military would be sufficient to appease the gods, but Galerius pushed for extermination. The two men sought the advice of the [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]].&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.6–11; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Odahl, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The oracle responded that the impious on Earth hindered Apollo's ability to provide advice. Rhetorically Eusebius records the Oracle as saying &quot;The just on Earth...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 2.50.&lt;/ref&gt; These impious, Diocletian was informed by members of the court, could only refer to the Christians of the empire. At the behest of his court, Diocletian acceded to demands for universal persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Odahl, 67; Potter, 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 303, Diocletian ordered that the newly built church at Nicomedia be razed. He demanded that its scriptures be burned, and seized its precious stores for the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337; Southern, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Diocletian's first &quot;Edict against the Christians&quot; was published.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Williams, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict ordered the destruction of Christian scriptures and places of worship across the empire, and prohibited Christians from assembling for worship.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Liebeschuetz, 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of February, a fire destroyed part of the Imperial palace.&lt;ref name=B24S168&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24; Southern, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius convinced Diocletian that the culprits were Christians, conspirators who had plotted with the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] of the palace. An investigation was commissioned, but no responsible party was found. Executions followed anyway, and the palace eunuchs Dorotheus and [[Gorgonius]] were executed. One individual, [[Peter Cubicularius]], was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was [[Boiling to death|slowly boiled]] over an open flame. The executions continued until at least 24 April 303, when six individuals, including the [[bishop]] [[Anthimus of Nicomedia|Anthimus]], were [[decapitation|decapitated]].&lt;ref name=BCE24&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A second fire occurred sixteen days after the first. Galerius left the city for Rome, declaring Nicomedia unsafe.&lt;ref name=B24S168/&gt; Diocletian would soon follow.&lt;ref name=BCE24/&gt;

Although further persecutionary edicts followed, compelling the arrest of the Christian clergy and universal acts of sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; the persecutionary edicts were ultimately unsuccessful; most Christians escaped punishment, and pagans too were generally unsympathetic to the persecution. The [[martyr]]s' sufferings strengthened the resolve of their fellow Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius and Maximian did not apply the later persecutionary edicts, and left the Christians of the West unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius rescinded the edict in 311, announcing that the persecution had failed to bring Christians back to traditional religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary apostasy of some Christians, and the surrendering of scriptures, during the persecution played a major role in the subsequent [[Donatist]] controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Tilley, xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Within twenty-five years of the persecution's inauguration, the Christian Emperor Constantine would rule the empire alone. He would reverse the consequences of the edicts, and return all confiscated property to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 48–49, 208–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Constantine's rule, Christianity would become the empire's preferred religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 208–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian was demonized by his Christian successors: Lactantius intimated that Diocletian's ascendancy heralded the apocalypse,&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Divinae Institutiones'' 7.16–17; cf. Daniel 7:23–25; Digeser, 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Serbian mythology]], Diocletian is remembered as [[Dukljan]], the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Š. Kulišić, P. Ž. Petrović, and N. Pantelić, Српски митолошки речник (Belgrade: Nolit, 1970), 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian entered the city of Rome in the early winter of 303. On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign (''vicennalia''), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls &quot;licentious familiarity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,&lt;ref name=tkuqen&gt;Potter, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius' account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius' company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.&lt;ref name=tkuqen/&gt; He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304–5 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumors alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, he seemed to have finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it was only retrieved by public declarations of his survival. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1–7; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine,&quot; 60; Odahl, 69–72; Potter, 341–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2–6; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximin]] were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine,&quot; 60–61; Odahl, 72–74; Southern, 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and death===

[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|300px|Diocletian in Retirement.]]

Diocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].

Maximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31–32; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's reply: &quot;If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'' 39.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived on for three more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 311.&lt;ref name=DEATH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==

===Tetrarchic and ideological===
[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace, Split (11908116224).jpg|thumb|Modern view of the [[Peristyle]] in [[Diocletian's Palace]] ([[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]])]]
Diocletian saw his work as that of a restorer, a figure of authority whose duty it was to return the empire to peace, to recreate stability and justice where barbarian hordes had destroyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He arrogated, regimented and centralized political authority on a massive scale. In his policies, he enforced an Imperial system of values on diverse and often unreceptive provincial audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Imperial propaganda from the period, recent history was perverted and minimized in the service of the theme of the tetrarchs as &quot;restorers&quot;. Aurelian's achievements were ignored, the revolt of Carausius was backdated to the reign of Gallienus, and it was implied that the tetrarchs engineered Aurelian's defeat of the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrenes]]; the period between Gallienus and Diocletian was effectively erased. The history of the empire before the tetrarchy was portrayed as a time of civil war, savage despotism, and imperial collapse.&lt;ref name=oqujbw&gt;Potter, 296–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In those inscriptions that bear their names, Diocletian and his companions are referred to as &quot;restorers of the whole world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 617, qtd. in Potter, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; men who succeeded in &quot;defeating the nations of the barbarians, and confirming the tranquility of their world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 641, qtd. in Potter, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian was written up as the &quot;founder of eternal peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 618, qtd. in Potter, 296. See also Millar, 182, on tetrarchic triumphalism in the Near East.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of restoration was conjoined to an emphasis on the uniqueness and accomplishments of the tetrarchs themselves.&lt;ref name=oqujbw/&gt;

The cities where emperors lived frequently in this period—Milan, [[Trier]], [[Arles]], Sirmium, [[Serdica]], [[Thessaloniki]], Nicomedia, and [[Antioch]]—were treated as alternate imperial seats, to the exclusion of Rome and its senatorial elite.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' ''[[primus inter pares]]'' were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of [[Tyrian purple|purple cloth]] to all but the emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 43; Potter, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (''adoratio''); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (''[[proskynesis]]'', προσκύνησις).&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 171–72; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 43; Liebeschuetz, 235–52, 240–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; His every appearance was stage-managed.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 153–54, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with his move from an ideology of republicanism to one of autocracy, Diocletian's council of advisers, his ''consilium'', differed from those of earlier emperors. He destroyed the Augustan illusion of imperial government as a cooperative affair between emperor, army, and senate.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; In its place he established an effectively autocratic structure, a shift later epitomized in the institution's name: it would be called a ''consistorium'' (&quot;[[wikt:consistory|consistory]]&quot;), not a council.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 171–72; Southern, 162–63; Williams, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The term ''consistorium'' was already in use for the room where council meetings took place.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 172, citing the ''Codex Justinianus'' 9.47.12.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Diocletian regulated his court by distinguishing separate departments (''scrina'') for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 162–63; Williams, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; From this structure came the offices of different ''magistri'', like the ''Magister officiorum'' (&quot;Master of offices&quot;), and associated secretariats. These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect – although a prefect like Asclepiodotus, the conqueror of the British Empire, was still a trained general&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 107/108&lt;/ref&gt; – but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.&lt;ref name=civil&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist [[Roger S. Bagnall|Roger Bagnall]] estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5–10,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (no one knows the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50–65 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per diocese depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13–15,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their comitatus, with the praetorian prefects, with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall, ''Egypt in Late Antiquity'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), 66, and A.H.M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1964), 594, cited in Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid the possibility of local usurpations,&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rouselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 678&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate a more efficient collection of taxes and supplies, and to ease the enforcement of the law, Diocletian doubled the number of [[Roman province|provinces]] from fifty to almost one hundred.&lt;ref&gt;As taken from the ''[[Laterculus Veronensis]]'' or ''Verona List'', reproduced in Barnes, ''New Empire'', chs. 12–13 (with corrections in T.D. Barnes, &quot;Emperors, panegyrics, prefects, provinces and palaces (284–317)&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 9 (1996): 539–42). See also: Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9; Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 179; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The provinces were grouped into twelve [[Roman diocese|dioceses]], each governed by an appointed official called a ''[[vicarius]]'', or &quot;deputy of the praetorian prefects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the provincial divisions required revision, and were modified either soon after 293 or early in the fourth century.&lt;ref name=hcwmwc&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome herself (including her environs, as defined by a {{convert|100|mi|km}}-[[radius]] [[perimeter]] around the city itself) was not under the authority of the praetorian prefect, as she was to be administered by a city prefect of senatorial rank&amp;nbsp;– the sole prestigious post with actual power reserved exclusively for senators, except for some governors in Italy with the titles of corrector and the proconsuls of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 655/666&lt;/ref&gt; The dissemination of imperial law to the provinces was facilitated under Diocletian's reign, because Diocletian's reform of the Empire's provincial structure meant that there were now a greater number of governors (''[[Praeses|praesides]]'') ruling over smaller regions and smaller populations.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's reforms shifted the governors' main function to that of the presiding official in the lower courts:&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 53–54; Potter, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the early Empire military and judicial functions were the function of governor, and [[Promagistrate|procurators]] had supervised taxation; under the new system ''vicarii'' and governors were responsible for justice and taxation, and a new class of ''[[Dux|duces]]'' (&quot;[[duke]]s&quot;), acting independently of the civil service, had military command.&lt;ref&gt;Although there were still some governors – like Arpagius, the 298 governor of [[Britannia Secunda]] – who still busied themselves with military affairs in strained circumstances: Williams, 107&lt;/ref&gt; These dukes sometimes administered two or three of the new provinces created by Diocletian, and had forces ranging from two thousand to more than twenty thousand men.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9–10; Treadgold, 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their roles as judges and tax collectors, governors were expected to maintain the postal service (''[[cursus publicus]]'') and ensure that town councils fulfilled their duties.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 25, citing Simon Corcoran, ''The Empire of the Tetrarchs: Imperial Pronouncements and Government A.D. 284–324'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 234–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

This curtailment of governors' powers as the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the political dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, but it also severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman,''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire''. Harvard University Press, 2009, ISBN 0-674-00641-0 , page 31&lt;/ref&gt; – specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence.&lt;ref&gt;Inge Mennen, ''Power and Status in the Roman Empire, AD 193–284''. Leiden: Brill, 2011, ISBN 978-90-04-20359-4 , page 77&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of treading on the toes of the local magnates of senatorial rank.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 2.13.1, qtd. by Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''l&quot;Empire Romain'', 678.&lt;/ref&gt; If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt these pressures, one can imagine the difficulties faced by a mere ''praeses''.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Roussele, ''L'Empire Romain'', 678&lt;/ref&gt; That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in [[Seleucia Pieria]] and [[Antioch]] made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, '' Galerius and the Will of Diocletian''; [[Paul Veyne]], ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4, page 64, footnote 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===
[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1581 reprint of the ''Digestorum'' from [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' (527–534). The ''Corpus'' drew on the codices of [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorius]] and [[Codex Hermogenianus|Hermogenian]], drafted and published under Diocletian's reign.]]
As with most emperors, much of Diocletian's daily routine rotated around legal affairs—responding to appeals and petitions, and delivering decisions on disputed matters. Rescripts, authoritative interpretations issued by the emperor in response to demands from disputants in both public and private cases, were a common duty of second- and third-century emperors. Diocletian was awash in paperwork, and was nearly incapable of delegating his duties. It would have been seen as a dereliction of duty to ignore them. In the &quot;nomadic&quot; imperial courts of the later Empire, one can track the progress of the imperial retinue through the locations from whence particular rescripts were issued – the presence of the Emperor was what allowed the system to function.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Connolly, ''Lives behind the Laws: The World of the Codex Hermogenianus''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-253-35401-3 , page 61&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever the imperial court would settle in one of the capitals, there was a glut in petitions, as in late 294 in Nicomedia, where Diocletian kept winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Radner, ed., ''State Correspondence in the Ancient World: From New Kingdom Egypt to the Roman Empire''. Oxford University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-19-935477-1, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and [[Hermogenian|Aurelius Hermogenianus]]—aided in regulating the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 53–54, 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts in his name still surviving, and these probably represent only a small portion of the total issue.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, &quot;Epiclassical Law&quot; (CAH), 201; Williams, ''Diocletian''. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 296, 652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the governance of the [[jurist]]s Gregorius, Aurelius Arcadius Charisius, and Hermogenianus, the imperial government began issuing official books of [[precedent]], collecting and listing all the rescripts that had been issued from the reign of [[Hadrian]] (r. 117–38) to the reign of Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 14–15; Potter, 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Codex Gregorianus]] includes rescripts up to 292, which the [[Codex Hermogenianus]] updated with a comprehensive collection of rescripts issued by Diocletian in 293 and 294.&lt;ref name=hcwmwc/&gt; Although the very act of codification was a radical innovation, given the precedent-based design of the Roman legal system,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt; the jurists were generally conservative, and constantly looked to past Roman practice and theory for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 21, 29–30; Potter, 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt; They were probably given more free rein over their codes than the later compilers of the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (438) and ''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' (529) would have. Gregorius and Hermogenianus' codices lack the rigid structuring of later codes,&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not published in the name of the emperor, but in the names of their compilers.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Their official character, however, was clear in that both collections were subsequently acknowledged by courts as authoritative records of imperial legislation up to the date of their publication and regularly updated.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''Fundamentals of Roman Private Law''. Berlin: Springer, 2012, ISBN 978-3-642-29310-8 , page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

After Diocletian's reform of the provinces, governors were called ''iudex'', or [[judge]]. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, as well as to the more distant office of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of [[appeal]], Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, &quot;Epiclassical Law&quot; (CAH), 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{See also|Late Roman army#Diocletian|l1=Late Roman army: Diocletian}}
It is archaeologically difficult to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] along the [[Lake Constance]]-[[Basel]] and the Rhine–[[Iller]]–Danube line),&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 166&lt;/ref&gt; on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river, the ''Ripa Sarmatica'', was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses&lt;ref&gt;Edward Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire''. Baltimore: JHU Press, 1979, ISBN 0-8018-2158-4, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, 167; Campbell, &quot;The Army&quot; (CAH), 124–26; Southern, 154–55. See also: Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 19–20; Williams, 91–101.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been:&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 171; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lactantius criticized Diocletian for an excessive increase in troop sizes, declaring that &quot;each of the four [tetrarchs] strove to have a far larger number of troops than previous emperors had when they were governing the state alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.2, qtd. in Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth-century pagan [[Zosimus]], by contrast, praised Diocletian for keeping troops on the borders, rather than keeping them in the cities, as Constantine was held to have done.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2.34 qtd. in Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Both these views had some truth to them, despite the biases of their authors: Diocletian and the tetrarchs did greatly expand the army, and the growth was mostly in frontier regions, where the increased effectives of the new Diocletianic legions seem to have been mostly spread across a network of strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, &quot;Rome et son empire&quot; 241&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish the precise details of these shifts given the weakness of the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 157; Treadgold, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The army expanded to about 580,000 men from a 285 strength of 390,000, of which 310,000 men were stationed in the East, most of whom manned the Persian frontier. The navy's forces increased from approximately 45,000 men to approximately 65,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Byzantine author [[Joannes Laurentius Lydus|John Lydus]] provides extraordinarily precise troop numbers: 389,704 in the army and 45,562 in the navy.&lt;ref&gt;''De Mensibus'' 1.27.&lt;/ref&gt; His precision has polarized modern historians. Some believe that Lydus found these figures in official documents, and that they are therefore broadly accurate; others believe that he fabricated them.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

Diocletian's expansion of the army and civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 158; Treadgold, 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs.&lt;ref name=lpnxzn&gt;Southern, 159; Treadgold, 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries.&lt;ref name=SSC159&gt;Southern, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.&lt;ref name=lpnxzn/&gt;

===Economic===

====Taxation====
In the early empire (30 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 235) the Roman government paid for what it needed in gold and silver. The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235–285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') – with one iugerum equal to approximately .65 acres – and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make city-wide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.&lt;ref name=TBSS20&gt;Treadgold, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.&lt;ref name=SSC159/&gt; Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.&lt;ref name=TBSS20/&gt;{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]''). When a ''capitulum'' extended across many farms, farmers provided the funds to compensate the neighbor who had supplied the recruit. Landowners of senatorial were able to commute the tax with a payment in gold (the ''aurum tironicum'').&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 173. See also: Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

Most taxes were due on each year on 1 September, and levied from individual landowners by ''[[Decurion (administrative)|decuriones]]'' (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect.&lt;ref name=sfirim&gt;Southern, 160; Treadgold, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's reforms also increased the number of financial officials in the provinces: more ''rationales'' and ''magistri privatae'' are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes in gold, and the Imperial properties.&lt;ref name=hcwmwc/&gt; Fluctuations in the value of the currency made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although these could be converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account.&lt;ref name=TBSS20/&gt; In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy, which had long been exempt from taxes, was included in the tax system from 290/291 as other provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9, 288; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 28–29; Southern, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Rome itself, however, remained exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''l&quot;Empire Romain'', 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian's edicts emphasized the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of ''decurion'', member of the city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall in the amount of tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.&lt;ref name=sfirim/&gt;

====Currency and inflation====
[[File:Edict on Maximum Prices Diocletian piece in Berlin.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (301), on display in [[Berlin]]]]
[[File:Prices edict Greek.jpg|thumb|Part of the prices edict in Greek in its original area built into a medieval church, Geraki, Greece]]
Aurelian's attempt to reform the currency had failed; the denarius was dead.&lt;ref name=SSC160&gt;Southern, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces.&lt;ref name=POTBAY392&gt;Potter, 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The new system consisted of five coins: the ''aureus''/''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the ''[[argenteus]]'', a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the ''[[follis]]'', sometimes referred to as the ''laureatus'' A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the ''radiatus'', a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the ''laureatus'' B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 392–93.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The ''[[denarius]]'' was dropped from the Imperial mints,&lt;ref name=SSC160/&gt; but the values of new coins continued to be measured in reference to it.&lt;ref name=POTBAY392/&gt;|group=notes}} Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).&lt;ref name=CAS76&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 301, however, the system was in trouble, strained by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his ''Edict on Coinage'', an act re-tariffing all debts so that the ''[[nummus]]'', the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 334, 393; Southern, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In the edict, preserved in an inscription from the city of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]] (near [[Geyre]], Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards.&lt;ref name=POTBAY33435&gt;Potter, 334–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 393.&lt;/ref&gt; This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,&lt;ref name=SSC160/&gt; somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.&lt;ref name=POTBAY33435/&gt; The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 160, 339.&lt;/ref&gt; In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 177–78; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was &quot;an act of economic lunacy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics – perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, &quot;Diocletian and the Tetrarchy&quot;, 42 and 44&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, &quot;Diocletian and the Tetrarchy&quot;,44&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 336; Southern, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6–7, cited in Cascio, &quot;The New State of Diocletian and Constantine&quot; (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 336; Williams, 131–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social and professional mobility====
Partly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Late Antinquity&quot; by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that &quot;It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 228–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 196–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 207–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine would claim to have the same close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed to have with Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.

The ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: '''anno Diocletiani'''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, 767&lt;/ref&gt; The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.

'''Maximian''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus Herculius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Maximian's name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS VALERIVS MAXIMIANVS HERCVLIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 250 – c. July 310&lt;ref name=&quot;BNNE32&quot;/&gt;) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 286 to 305. He was ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;CAESDATEa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAESDATEb&quot;/&gt; from 285 to 286, then ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' from 286&lt;ref name=&quot;AUGDATE&quot;/&gt; to 305.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNE4&quot;/&gt; He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, [[Diocletian]], whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at [[Trier]] but spent most of his time on campaign. In the late summer of 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the [[Bagaudae]]. From 285 to 288, he fought against [[Germanic tribes]] along the [[Rhine]] frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a [[scorched earth]] campaign deep into [[Alamanni]]c territory in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion.

The man he appointed to police the [[English Channel|Channel]] shores, [[Carausius]], rebelled in 286, causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius, and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximian's subordinate, [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]], campaigned against Carausius' successor, [[Allectus]], while Maximian held the [[Limes Germanicus|Rhine frontier]]. The rebel leader was ousted in 296, and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near [[Hispania]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] incursions in [[Mauretania]]. When these campaigns concluded in 298, he departed for Italy, where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletian's behest, Maximian abdicated on May 1, 305, gave the Augustan office to Constantius, and retired to southern Italy.

In late 306, Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son [[Maxentius]]' rebellion in Italy. In April 307, he attempted to depose his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantius' successor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]] (who was both Maximian's step-grandson and also his son-in-law), in Trier. At the Council of [[Carnuntum]] in November 308, Diocletian and his successor, [[Galerius]], forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310, Maximian attempted to seize Constantine's title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him, and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian committed suicide in the summer of 310 on Constantine's orders. During Constantine's war with Maxentius, Maximian's image was purged from all public places. However, after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius, Maximian's image was rehabilitated, and he was deified.

==Early life==
[[File:Coin of Maximian.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Antoninianus]] of Maximian]]
Maximian was born near [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]) in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Pannonia]], around 250 into a  family of [[shopkeeper]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' 40.10, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Williams, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohlsander1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlsander|first=Hans A.|title=The Emperor Constantine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXq0vaxe7mQC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-13178-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, the ancient sources contain vague allusions to [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] as his homeland,&lt;ref&gt;Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'' 39.26, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; to his Pannonian virtues,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegrici Latini'' 10(2).2.2ff, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and to his harsh upbringing along the war-torn [[Danube]] frontier.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegrici Latini'' 10(2).2.4, quoted in Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian joined the army, serving with Diocletian under the emperors [[Aurelian]] (r. 270–275) and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] (r. 276–282). He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of [[Carus]] in 283 and attended Diocletian's election as emperor on November 20, 284 at [[Nicomedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32–33; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian's swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian [[Timothy Barnes]] to mean that the two men were longterm allies, that their respective roles were pre-agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against [[Carinus]] (r. 283–285) but there is no direct evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Williams, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his great energy, firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel, Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourth-century historian [[Aurelius Victor]] described Maximian as &quot;a colleague trustworthy in friendship, if somewhat boorish, and of great military talents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'' 39, quoted in Williams, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his other qualities, Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The [[Panegyrici Latini|panegyric]] of 289, after comparing his actions to [[Scipio Africanus]]' victories over [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], suggested that Maximian had never heard of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2), quoted in Williams, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His ambitions were purely military; he left politics to Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Lactantius]] suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian's basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes, and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators' daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust, though Lactantius' credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 8, quoted in Williams, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian had two children with his [[Syria]]n wife, [[Eutropia]]: [[Maxentius]] and [[Fausta]]. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius' birth year have varied from c. 277 to 287, and most date Fausta's birth to c. 289 or 290.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34. Barnes dates Maxentius' birth to circa 283, when Maximian was in Syria, and Fausta's birth to 289 or 290 (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]], the wife of Constantius Chlorus, is often called Maximian's stepdaughter by ancient sources, leading to claims by [[Otto Seeck]] and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''de Caesaribus'' 39.25; Eutropius, ''Breviaria'' 9.22; Jerome, ''Chronicle'' 225&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.2, 40.12, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes challenges this view, saying that all &quot;stepdaughter&quot; sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte|Kaisergeschichte]]'', while other, more reliable sources, refer to her as Maximian's natural daughter.&lt;ref&gt;''Origo Constantini'' 2; [[Philostorgius]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 2.16&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33. See also ''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2)11.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c. 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus' daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment as Caesar==
[[File:Aureus à l'effigie de Maximien Hercule.jpg|thumb|Maximian]]
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Diocleziano (284-305 d.C.) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|Diocletian, Maximian's senior colleague and Augustus in the east]]
&lt;!-- I'd be happier if the reasons why came first but I can't think of a neat way of doing this at the moment.--&gt;

At [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]) in July 285,&lt;ref&gt;The event has been dated to both July 21 (Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4; Bowman, 69) and July 25 (Potter, 280–81).&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian proclaimed Maximian as his co-ruler, or Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4; Bowman, 69; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Potter, 280–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the Empire, from Gaul to Syria, from Egypt to the lower Danube, Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Southern, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons, just a daughter, Valeria, who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a co-ruler from outside his family and that co-ruler had to be someone he trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 280; Southern, 136; Williams, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; (The historian William Seston has argued that Diocletian, like heirless emperors before him, adopted Maximian as his ''filius Augusti'' (&quot;Augustan son&quot;) upon his appointment to the office. Some agree, but the historian [[Frank Kolb]] has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 69; Odahl, 42–43; Southern, 136, 331; Williams, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian did take Diocletian's ''[[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]]'' ([[family name]]) Valerius, however.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Finally, Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess, both sole-emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power.&lt;ref name=&quot;P280&quot;&gt;Potter, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, just a few years earlier, the emperor [[Carus]] and his sons had ruled jointly, albeit not for long. Even the first emperor, [[Augustus]], (r. 27 BC–AD 19), had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co-emperor had existed from [[Marcus Aurelius]] (r. 161–180) on.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dual system evidently worked well. About 287, the two rulers' relationship was re-defined in religious terms, with Diocletian assuming the title ''Iovius'' and Maximian ''Herculius''.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Liebeschuetz, ''Continuity and Change'', 235–52, 240–43; Odahl, 43–44; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles were pregnant with symbolism: Diocletian-[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] had the dominant role of planning and commanding; Maximian-[[Hercules]] the [[hero]]ic role of completing assigned tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11–12; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Odahl, 43; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 32–33, 39, 42–52; Southern, 136–37; Williams, 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet despite the symbolism, the emperors were not &quot;gods&quot; in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] (although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics). Instead, they were the gods' instruments, imposing the gods' will on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the rituals were over, Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Southern, 137; Williams, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early campaigns in Gaul and Germany==
The [[Bagaudae]] of Gaul are obscure figures, appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources, with their 285 uprising being their first appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth-century historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] described them as rural people under the leadership of [[Aelianus (rebel)|Amandus and Aelianus]], while Aurelius Victor called them bandits.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Brev''. 9.20; Aurelius Victor, ''de Caesaribus'', 39.17, quoted in Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants, seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus (a native of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], in what would become southern [[France]]): in this case, they would be defecting imperial troops, not brigands.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Although poorly equipped, led and trained – and therefore a poor match for Roman legions – Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 10; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Southern, 137; Williams, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian traveled to Gaul, engaging the Bagaudae late in the summer of 285.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Bowman, 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail: the historical sources dwell only on Maximian's virtues and victories. The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency.&lt;ref name=&quot;S137&quot;&gt;Southern, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; As the campaign was against the Empire's own citizens, and therefore distasteful, it went unrecorded in [[Victory title|titles]] and official [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]. Indeed, Maximian's panegyrist declares: &quot;I pass quickly over this episode, for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2), quoted in Williams, 46; Southern, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the revolt had significantly abated, and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier, heralding a period of stability.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 139–138; Williams, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In the autumn of 285, two barbarian armies – one of [[Burgundians]] and Alamanni, the other of Chaibones and [[Heruli]] – forded the Rhine and entered Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Bowman, 71; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The first army was left to die of disease and hunger, while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; either at Moguntiacum ([[Mainz]], [[Germany]]), Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany), or Colonia Agrippina ([[Cologne]], Germany).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 282–83. Potter and Barnes (''New Empire'', 56) favor Trier; Williams (''Diocletian'', 46) favors Mainz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carausius==
{{See also|Carausius|Carausian Revolt}}
[[File:romanantefix.jpg|thumb|right|A Roman [[Ante-fixae|antefix]] roof tile showing the badge and standard of [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]], one of the legions that joined Carausius' rebellion]]

Although most of Gaul was pacified, regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[piracy]]. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the [[Saxon Shore]], but much remained to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 138; Williams, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at [[Dover]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] during 270–285.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the pirate problem, Maximian appointed Mausaeus [[Carausius]], a [[Menapii|Menapian]] from [[Germania Inferior]] (southern and western [[Netherlands]]) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Carausius fared well,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 71; Southern, 138; Williams, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 138; Williams, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6–7; Bowman, 71; Potter, 283–84; Southern, 137–41; Williams, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian ordered Carausius' arrest and execution, prompting him to flee to Britain. Carausius' support among the British was strong, and at least two British legions ([[Legio II Augusta|II Augusta]] and XX Valeria Victrix) defected to him, as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne (probably [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix|XXX Ulpia Victrix]]).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 284; Southern, 139–40; Williams, 47. Most of the information for the legions under Carausius' control comes from his coinage. Strangely, [[Legio VI Victrix]] from [[Eboracum]] ([[York]], United Kingdom), which, for geographical regions, should have been included in the legions Carausius had control over, generally is not (Southern, 332). The ''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(4)12.1 admits one continental legion joined him, probably the XXX Ulpia Victrix (Potter, 650).&lt;/ref&gt; Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;W47&quot;&gt;Williams, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet – he had given it to Carausius – and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks. Meanwhile, Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet, enlisting Frankish mercenaries, and paying his troops well.&lt;ref name=&quot;W47&quot;/&gt; By the autumn of 286, Britain, much of northwestern Gaul, and the entire Channel coast, was under his control.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bowman, 71; Southern, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state, an ''Imperium Britanniarum'' and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian, earning the support of British and Gallic merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Maximian's troops were vulnerable to Carausius' influence and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 284; Williams, 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximian appointed Augustus==
Spurred by the crisis with Carausius, on April 1, 286,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUGDATE&quot;/&gt; Maximian took the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bleckmann; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Potter, 282; Southern, 141–42; Williams, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him the same status as Carausius – so the clash was between two Augusti, rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar – and, in Imperial propaganda, Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian's brother, his equal in authority and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian's appointment,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 282, 649. Diocletian would have been somewhere between [[Byzantium]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]), where he is attested for March 22, 286 and [[Tiberias]], where he is attested from May 31, 286 through August 31 (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 50–51; Potter, 282, 649).&lt;/ref&gt; causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support, and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 282, 649.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the physical distance between the emperors, Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers, and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 282; Williams, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium. Though divisions did take place – each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences – these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a ''patrimonium indivisum''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 70; Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: &quot;So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two [[Heracleidae]], the [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan Kings]], had done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2)9.4, quoted in Potter, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors' names, and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian's province of Africa; Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletian's territory.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns against Rhenish tribes==

===Campaigns in 286 and 287===
Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bowman, 71; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 141; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maximian had many enemies along the river, they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;W50&quot;&gt;Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Few clear dates survive for Maximian's campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 142. Barnes' ''New Empire'' records five dates for the period: the first, February 10, 286 at Milan (''Codex Justinianus'' 8.53(54).6; ''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 282); June 21, 286 at Mainz (''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 271); January 1, 287 Trier or Cologne or Mainz (date of consular assumption, ''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2).6.2 ff.); and 287, his &quot;expedition across the Rhine&quot; (''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2).7.1ff.) (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57).&lt;/ref&gt; 
While receiving the consular ''[[fasces]]'' on January 1, 287, Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor, he marched against the barbarians and, although they were not entirely dispersed, he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bowman, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the [[Moselle]]-[[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] region to be the greatest threat, so he targeted them first. He campaigned using scorched earth tactics, laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni, Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person, riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies weakened from starvation,&lt;ref name=&quot;W50&quot;/&gt; Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved deep into Germanic territory, bringing destruction to his enemies' homelands&lt;ref name=&quot;W50&quot;/&gt; and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCE7&quot;/&gt; By the winter of 287, he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;W50&quot;/&gt; Maximian's panegyrist declared: &quot;All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2).7.7, translated by Nixon in Nixon and Rodgers, quoted in Bowman, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Const.chlorus02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|right|Flavius Constantius, Maximian's [[praetorian prefect]] and husband to his daughter Theodora]]

===Joint campaign against the Alamanni===
The following spring, as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Southern, 142–43; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors met that year, but neither date nor place is known with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31; Southern, 142–43; Williams, 50. Barnes (''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7) dates the meeting to after the campaign against the Alamanni.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, Maximian led a surprise invasion of the [[Agri Decumates]] – a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory – while Diocletian invaded Germany via [[Raetia]]. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 142–43; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximian's build-up to proceed without further disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot;, 40; Southern, 143; Williams, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the war, towns along the Rhine were rebuilt, bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne, and a military frontier was established, comprising forts, roads, and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum ([[Tournai]], [[Belgium]]), Bavacum ([[Bavay]], France), Atuatuca Tungrorum ([[Tongeren]], Belgium), Mosae Trajectum ([[Maastricht]], Netherlands), and Cologne connected points along the frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;W5051&quot;&gt;Williams, 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constantius, Gennobaudes, and resettlement===
In early 288, Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect [[Constantius Chlorus]], husband of Maximian's daughter Theodora, to lead a campaign against Carausius' Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine [[estuary|estuaries]], thwarting sea-attacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory, wreaking havoc, and reaching the [[North Sea]]. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes&quot;/&gt; Gennobaudes became Maximian's vassal and, with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes, Roman regional dominance was assured.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bowman, 72; Williams, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximian allowed a settlement of [[Frisii]], [[Salian Franks]], [[Chamavi]] and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory, either between the Rhine and [[Waal (river)|Waal]] rivers from Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]], Netherlands) to [[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]], (Utrecht, Netherlands)&lt;ref name=&quot;W5051&quot;/&gt; or near Trier.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCE7&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes, giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;W5051&quot;/&gt;

==Later campaigns in Britain and Gaul==

===Failed expedition against Carausius===
[[File:Antoninianus Carausius leg4-RIC 0069v.jpg|thumb|right|Carausius, rebel emperor of [[Roman Britain]]]]

By 289, Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius' Britain, but for some reason the plan failed. Maximian's panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign's prospects, but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius' panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5)12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7, 288; Bowman, 72–73; Potter, 284–85, 650; Southern, 143; Williams, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 143; Williams, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after, perhaps on learning of Maximian's failure.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 285; Southern, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian returned in haste to the West, reaching Emesa by May 10, 290,&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 9.41.9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 51; Potter, 285, 650.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sirmium on the Danube by July 1, 290.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 6.30.6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 52; Potter, 285, 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Potter, 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds gathered to witness the event, and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)10, quoted in Williams, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Potter, among others, has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Potter, 285, 288; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors (the [[Tetrarchy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 285; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)2.4, 8.1, 11.3–4, 12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8, 288; Potter, 285, 650.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors would not meet again until 303.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Maximian's failure to invade in 289, an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius' rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part, Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 55–56, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian, however, would not tolerate this affront to his rule. Faced with Carausius' secession and further challenges on the Egyptian, Syrian, and Danubian borders, he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 293 at Milan, Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 36–37; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; On either the same day or a month later, Diocletian did the same for [[Galerius]], thus establishing the &quot;Tetrarchy&quot;, or &quot;rule of four&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 38; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8, 15; Williams, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign against Allectus===
[[File:Quinarius Allectus galley-RIC 0128.2.jpg|thumb|right|Allectus, Carausius' successor]]

Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year, Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer, [[Allectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15; Potter, 288; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 99; Southern, 149–50; Williams, 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius' Frankish allies, taking the title ''Germanicus maximus''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15–16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 255.&lt;/ref&gt; His sights now set on Britain, Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15–16; Southern, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian, still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius, was apprised of the invasion plans and, in the summer of 296, returned to Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius' Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Southern, 150; Williams, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Allectus was killed on the [[North Downs]] in battle with Constantius' praetorian prefect, [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]]. Constantius himself had landed near [[Dubris]] (Dover) and marched on [[Roman London|Londinium]] ([[London]]), whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 150; Williams, 73–74; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns in North Africa==
With Constantius' victorious return, Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania ([[Northwest Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Southern, 150; Williams, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman authority weakened during the third century, nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289, the governor of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] (roughly modern [[Algeria]]) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and [[Quinquegentiani]], but the raiders soon returned. In 296, Maximian raised an army, from [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian cohorts]], [[Aquileia]]n, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]], and [[Thracian]] recruits, advancing through Spain that autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Williams, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have defended the region against raiding [[Moors]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes_2&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; before crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into [[Mauretania Tingitana]] (roughly modern [[Morocco]]) to protect the area from Frankish pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;W75&quot;&gt;Williams, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 297, Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy, and Maximian spent the winter of 297–298 resting in [[Carthage]] before returning to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the [[Atlas Mountains]] – from which they could continue to wage war – Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable, and the Berbers were skilled at [[guerrilla warfare]], but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes, he devastated previously secure land, killed as many as he could, and drove the remainder back into the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODHW&quot;&gt;Odahl, 58; Williams, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was concluded by the spring of 298 and, on March 10, he made a triumphal entry into Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Odahl, 58; Williams, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions there record the people's gratitude to Maximian, hailing him – as Constantius had been on his entry to London – as ''redditor lucis aeternae'' (&quot;restorer of the eternal light&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODHW&quot;/&gt; Maximian returned to Italy in 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Odahl, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure and retirement==
After his Mauretanian campaign, Maximian returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius, and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators, to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several, including the prefect of Rome in 301/2.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''DMP'' 8.4; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 – while Maximian was resting in Italy – continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes_2&quot;/&gt;

Maximian was only disturbed from his rest in 303 by Diocletian's ''vicennalia'', the 20-year anniversary of his reign, in Rome. Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together, passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius ''DMP'' 20.4; Potter, 340; Southern, 152, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably Maximian's son [[Maxentius]] and Constantius' son [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] – children raised in [[Nicomedia]] together – would then become the new Caesars. While Maximian might not have wished to retire, Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement, Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the [[Secular Games]] in 304.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 340.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AE silvered follis of Maximianus.jpg|thumb|right|silvered [[follis]] struck in [[Aquileia]] 305-306 AD commemorating Maximian's abdication]]
On May 1, 305, in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia, Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go entirely to Maximian's liking: perhaps because of Galerius' influence, [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were appointed Caesar, thus excluding Maxentius. Both the newly appointed Caesars had had long military careers and were close to Galerius: Maximinus was his nephew and Severus a former army comrade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Williams, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy, which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held.  Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as Caesar, within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son's rebellion against the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Potter, 341–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian retired to the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] he had built in his homeland, Dalmatia near Salona on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. Maximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]], where he lived a life of ease and luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Although far from the political centers of the Empire, Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maxentius' rebellion==
After the death of Constantius on July 25, 306, Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius, who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted. The title of Augustus then went to Severus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27–28; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 5; Lenski, 61–62; Odahl, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius was jealous of Constantine's power, and on October 28, 306, he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him as Augustus. Uncomfortable with sole leadership, Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as &quot;Augustus for the second time&quot;, offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus' soldiers had served under Maximian, and had taken Maxentius' bribes, most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to [[Ravenna]], which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms, which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome, where he was kept as a hostage. In the autumn of 307, Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome, and retreated north with his army mostly intact.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30–31; Elliott, 41–42; Lenski, 62–63; Odahl, 86–87; Potter, 348–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maxentius02 pushkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Dresden bust of Maxentius]]

While Maxentius built up Rome's defenses, Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximian's younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius' secessionist regime.  In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and support Maxentius' cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in the late summer of 307, at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 87–88; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Recasting may might require redistribution of refs.--&gt;

Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–8 but soon fell out with his son and in the spring of 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Rome's sickly government, disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it, and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius' shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius, and Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 89, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 308, to resolve the political instability, Galerius called Diocletian (out of retirement) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube. There, Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar, with Maximinus the Caesar in the east. [[Licinius]], a loyal military companion to Galerius, was appointed Augustus of the West&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32–34; Elliott, 42–43; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90–91; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349–50; Treadgold, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul, the only court that would still accept him.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of ''Sons of the Augusti'', they were promoted in early 310, with the result that there were now four Augusti.&lt;ref&gt;Cary and Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p522&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion against Constantine==
In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the [[Tyrian purple|imperial purple]]. Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave the city. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia ([[Marseille]]). The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34–35; Elliott, 43; Lenski, 65–66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the earlier rupture in relations, after Maximian's suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father's devoted son.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 43; Lenski, 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He minted coins bearing his father's deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34; Elliott, 45; Lenski, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''DMP'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40–41, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine defeated Maxentius at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] on October 28, 312. Maxentius died, and Italy came under Constantine's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eutropia]] swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian's son, and Maximian's memory was rehabilitated. His [[apotheosis]] under Maxentius was declared null and void, and he was re-consecrated as a god, probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantine's coinage as ''divus'', or divine, by 318, together with the deified Constantius and [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The three were hailed as Constantine's forbears. They were called &quot;the best of emperors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his daughters Fausta and Flavia, Maximian was grandfather or great-grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

G. and J. Robinson|page=69|quote=Constantius, who from his pale complexion had acquired the denomination of Chlorus}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of [[Constantine the Great]] and founder of the [[Constantinian dynasty]].

As ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', he defeated the usurper [[Allectus]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and campaigned extensively along the [[Limes Germanicus|Rhine frontier]], defeating the [[Alamanni]] and [[Franks]]. Upon becoming ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' in 305, Constantius launched a successful punitive campaign against the [[Picts]] beyond the [[Antonine Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hanson [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_109/109_140_150.pdf &quot;Roman campaigns north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus: the evidence of the temporary camps&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Constantius died suddenly in [[Eburacum]] ([[York]]) the following year. His death sparked the collapse of the [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchic]] system of government inaugurated by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Diocletian]].

==Life==

===Early career===
Born in [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], Constantius was the son of Eutropius, whom the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' claimed to be a [[nobility|nobleman]] from northern [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], in the province of [[Moesia Superior]], and Claudia, a niece of the emperors [[Claudius II]] and [[Quintillus]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''Life of Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Claudius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians suspect this maternal connection to be a genealogical [[Lie#Fabrication|fabrication]] created by his son [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]],&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 172&lt;/ref&gt; and that his family were of humble origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 227&quot;&gt;Martindale, pg. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, however, might have been the uncle of [[Eutropia]], wife of [[Maximian]].

Constantius was a member of the ''[[Protectores Augusti Nostri]]'' under the emperor [[Aurelian]] and fought in the east against the secessionist [[Palmyrene Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 288&quot;&gt;Potter, pg. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  While the claim that he had been made a ''[[dux]]'' under the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] is probably a fabrication,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 228&quot;&gt;Martindale, pg. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''Life of Probus'' 22:3&lt;/ref&gt; he certainly attained the rank of ''[[tribunus]]'' within the army, and during the reign of [[Carus]] he was raised to the position of ''[[Praeses]]'', or governor, of the province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, Charles Matson. Constantine and the Christian Empire. New York: Routledge, 2004. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been conjectured that he switched allegiances to support the claims of the future emperor [[Diocletian]] just before Diocletian defeated [[Carinus]], the son of Carus, at the [[Battle of the Margus]] in July 285.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

In 286, Diocletian elevated a military colleague, [[Maximian]], to the throne as co-emperor of the western provinces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 142&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt; while Diocletian took over the eastern provinces, beginning the process that would eventually see the division of the [[Roman Empire]] into two halves, a [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and an [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]] portion.  By 288, his period as governor now over, Constantius had been made [[Praetorian Prefect]] in the west under Maximian.&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio, ''Constantine I Chlorus''; Canduci, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout 287 and into 288, Constantius, under the command of Maximian, was involved in a war against the [[Alamanni]], carrying out attacks on the territory of the barbarian tribes across the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 142&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  To strengthen the ties between the emperor and his powerful military servant, in 289 Constantius divorced his wife (or concubine) [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], and married the emperor Maximian’s daughter, [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 288; Canduci, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elevation as Caesar===
[[File:Argenteus-Constantius I-antioch RIC 033a.jpg|300px|left|thumb|On the reverse of this [[argenteus]] struck in [[Antioch]] under Constantius Chlorus, the [[tetrarchy|tetrarchs]] are sacrificing to celebrate a victory against the [[Sarmatia]]ns.]]
By 293, Diocletian, conscious of the ambitions of his co-emperor for his new son-in-law, allowed Maximian to promote Constantius in a new power sharing arrangement known as the [[Tetrarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 145&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt;  Diocletian divided the administration of the [[Roman Empire]] into two halves, a [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and an [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]] portion. Each would be ruled by an [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], supported by a [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]. Both Caesars had the right of succession once the ruling Augustus died.

At [[Milan]] on March 1, 293, Constantius was formally appointed as Maximian’s Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 382&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the names Flavius Valerius&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 147&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and was given command of [[Gaul]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and possibly [[Hispania]]. Diocletian, the eastern Augustus, in order to keep the balance of power in the imperium&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 145&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; elevated [[Galerius]] as his Caesar, possibly on May 21, 293 at [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 288&quot;/&gt;  Constantius was the more senior of the two Caesars, and on official documents he always took precedence, being mentioned before Galerius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 147&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantius’ capital was to be located at [[Augusta Treverorum]].

Constantius’ first task on becoming Caesar was to deal with the [[Roman usurper]] [[Carausius]] who had declared himself emperor in Britannia and northern [[Gaul]] in 286.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, pg. 288&quot;/&gt;  In late 293, Constantius defeated the forces of Carausius in Gaul, capturing [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Bononia]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 385&lt;/ref&gt;  This precipitated the assassination of Carausius by his ''[[rationalis]]'' [[Allectus]], who assumed command of the British provinces until his death in 296.

Constantius spent the next two years neutralising the threat of the [[Franks]] who were the allies of Allectus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; as northern Gaul remained under the control of the British usurper until at least 295.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 387&lt;/ref&gt;  He also battled against the [[Alamanni]], achieving some victories at the mouth of the [[Rhine]] in 295.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pgs. 385-386&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrative concerns meant he made at least one trip to Italy during this time as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Only when he felt ready (and only when Maximian finally came to relieve him at the Rhine frontier&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;) did he assemble two invasion fleets with the intent of crossing the [[English Channel]]. The first was entrusted to [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]], Constantius’ long-serving [[Praetorian prefect]], who sailed from the mouth of the [[Seine]], while the other, under the command of Constantius himself, was launched from his base at Bononia.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt;  The fleet under Asclepiodotus landed near the [[Isle of Wight]], and his army encountered the forces of Allectus, resulting in the defeat and death of the usurper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''Liber de Caesaribus'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39]&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantius in the meantime occupied [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 292&lt;/ref&gt; saving the city from an attack by [[Franks|Frankish]] mercenaries who were now roaming the province without a paymaster. Constantius massacred all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius remained in Britannia for a few months, replaced most of Allectus’ officers, and the British provinces were probably at this time subdivided along the lines of Diocletian’s other administrative reforms of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the division of Upper Britannia into [[Maxima Caesariensis]] and [[Britannia Prima]], while [[Flavia Caesariensis]] and [[Britannia Secunda]] were carved out of Lower Britannia. He also restored [[Hadrian’s Wall]] and its forts.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 298, Constantius fought in the [[Battle of Lingones]] ([[Langres]]) against the [[Alamanni]]. He was shut up in the city, but was relieved by his army after six hours and defeated the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Breviarum'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#23 9.23]&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated them again at [[Battle of Vindonissa|Vindonissa]] ([[Windisch]], [[Switzerland]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrv.com/military/battles-of-the-third-century.php UNRV History: Battle of the Third Century AD]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby strengthening the defenses of the [[Rhine]] frontier.  In 300, he fought against the [[Franks]] on the Rhine frontier,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 152&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of his overall strategy to buttress the frontier, Constantius settled the Franks in the deserted parts of [[Gaul]] to repopulate the devastated areas.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, over the next three years the Rhine frontier continued to occupy Constantius’ attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 152&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In 303, Constantius was confronted with the imperial edicts instituted by Diocletian dealing with the [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution of Christians]]. The campaign was avidly pursued by [[Galerius]], who noticed that Constantius was well-disposed towards the [[Christians]], and who saw it as a method of advancing his career prospects with the aging Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 338&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the four Tetrarchs, Constantius made the least effort to implement the decrees in the western provinces that were under his direct authority,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 339; Southern, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; limiting himself to knocking down a handful of churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiMaio, Constantine I Chlorus&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constantine I Chlorus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accession as Augustus and death===
[[File:Constantius I capturing London after defeating Allectus Beaurains hoard.jpg|thumb|Medal of Constantius I capturing [[Londinium]] (inscribed as LON) after defeating [[Allectus]]. [[Beaurains hoard]].]]

Between 303 and 305, Galerius began maneuvering to ensure that he would be in a position to take power from Constantius after the passing of Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  In 304, Maximian met with Galerius, probably to discuss the succession issue and Constantius either was not invited or could not make it due to the situation on the Rhine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 152&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  Although prior to 303 there appeared to be tacit agreement between the Tetrarchs that Constantius’s son, [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maximian’s son [[Maxentius]] were to be promoted to the rank of Caesar once Diocletian and Maximian had resigned the purple,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of 304 Galerius had convinced Diocletian (who in turn convinced Maximian) to appoint Galerius’s nominees [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus Daia]] as Caesars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 152&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian and Maximian stepped down as co-emperors on May 1, 305, possibly due to Diocletian's poor health.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiMaio, Constantine I Chlorus&quot;/&gt;  Before the assembled armies at [[Milan]], Maximian removed his purple cloak and handed it to Severus, the new ''Caesar'', and proclaimed Constantius as ''Augustus''. The same scene played out at [[Nicomedia]] under the authority of Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a Caesar, fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 169; Canduci, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, just as he was preparing to campaign in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 170; Eutropius, ''Breviarum'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans10.html#1 10.1]; Aurelius Victor, ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm 39]; Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus02_book2.htm 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 305 Constantius crossed over into Britain, travelled to the far north of the island and launched a military expedition against the [[Picts]], claiming a victory against them and the title ''Britannicus Maximus II'' by 7 January 306.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 406&lt;/ref&gt;  After retiring to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) for the winter, Constantius had planned to continue the campaign, but on 25 July 306, he died. As he was dying, Constantius recommended his son to the army as his successor;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pg. 346&lt;/ref&gt; consequently Constantine was declared emperor by the legions at York.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Breviarum'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans10.html#1 10.1–2]; Canduci, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Constantius was either married to, or was in concubinage with, [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], who was probably from [[Nicomedia]] in Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Breviarum'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#22 9.22]; [[Zosimus]], ''Historia Nova'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus02_book2.htm 2]; ''Exerpta Valesiana'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Excerpta_Valesiana/1*.html#2a 1.2]&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son: [[Constantine I|Constantine]].

In 289 political developments forced him to divorce Helena. He married [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]], [[Maximian]]'s daughter. They had six children:&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale, pg. 228&quot;/&gt;

==Legend==

===Christian legends===
As the father of Constantine, a number of Christian legends have grown up around Constantius. [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]'s ''Life of Constantine'' claims that Constantius was himself a Christian, although he pretended to be a pagan, and while Caesar under Diocletian, took no part in the Emperor's persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''Vita Constantini'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.i.xiii.html 1.13–18]&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], claimed to find the [[True Cross]].

===British legends===
Constantius's activities in Britain were remembered in [[Welsh legends|medieval Welsh legend]], which frequently confused his family with that of [[Magnus Maximus]], who also was said to have wed a [[Saint Elen]] and sired a son named Constantine while in Britain. [[Henry of Huntingdon]]'s ''History of the English'' identified ''Constantius's'' wife Helen as British&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry of Huntingdon]], ''Historia Anglorum'' [[s:History of the English/Book 1#37|1.37]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] repeated the claim in his 1136 ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]''. Geoffrey related that Constantius was sent to Britain by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] after [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]] (here a British king) was overthrown by [[King Cole|Coel]] of [[Camulodunum|Colchester]]. Coel submitted to Constantius and agreed to pay tribute to Rome, but died only eight days later. Constantius married his daughter Helena and became [[king of Britain]]. He and Helena had a son, Constantine, who succeeded to the throne of Britain when his father died at [[Eboracum|York]] eleven years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5#6|5.6]]&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts have no historical validity: Constantius had divorced Helena before he went to Britain.

Similarly, the ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'' traditionally ascribed to [[Nennius]]&lt;ref name=mommy&gt;[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}). [[s:la:Historia Brittonum|''Historia Brittonum''.]] Composed after {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;830. {{la icon}} Hosted at [[s:la:Main Page|Latin Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the inscribed tomb of &quot;Constantius the Emperor&quot; was still present in the 9th century in [[Segontium]] (near present-day [[Caernarfon]], [[Wales]]).&lt;ref name=shusher&gt;Newman, John Henry &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. [http://www.mocavo.co.uk/Lives-of-the-English-Saints-St-Gilbert-Prior-of-Sempringham-Volume-3/527392/459 ''Lives of the English Saints: St. German, Bishop of Auxerre'', Ch.&amp;nbsp;X: &quot;Britain in 429, A.&amp;nbsp;D.&quot;,&lt;!--sic--&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;92.] James Toovey (London), 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Nash Ford|Ford]] credited the monument to Constantine, the supposed son of Magnus Maximus and Elen, who was said to have ruled over the area prior to the [[Irish invasions of Wales|Irish invasions]].&lt;ref name=nashford&gt;Ford, David Nash. &quot;[http://www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html The 28 Cities of Britain]&quot; at Britannia. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lactantius is commenting on Diocletian and the place where Diocletian was acclaimed, and that the &quot;Maximianus&quot; in the text is therefore a later gloss; the Paschal Chronicle is not authoritative for this period for events outside Egypt, and may simply be commenting on the day when the laureled image of the new emperors arrived in Alexandria. Potter (2004, 650) agrees that locating the acclamation to Nicomedia is false, but believes that Seston's other evidence makes a strong case for a temporal lag between the two Caesars' acclamations.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 May 305 (as [[Caesar (title)#Tetrarchy|Caesar]], under [[Diocletian]])&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes, New Empire, p. 4&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 May 305&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;late April or early May 311 (as [[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augustus]] alongside [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] (until July 25, 306) then [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] (until spring 307) then [[Constantine I|Constantine]] (from ''ca''.

'''Galerius''' ({{lang-la|Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Galerius' name would be inscribed as GAIVS GALERIVS VALERIVS MAXIMIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 260 – April or May 311), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 305 to 311.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canduci Triumph&quot;&gt;{{citation |last = Canduci |title = Triumph &amp; Tragedy}}.{{rp |119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his reign he campaigned, aided by [[Diocletian]], against the [[Sassanid Empire]], sacking their capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 299.  He also campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], defeating them in 297 and 300. Although he was a staunch opponent of [[Christianity]], Galerius ended the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] when he issued an [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|edict of toleration]] in 311.

==Early life==
Galerius was born in [[Sofia|Serdica]],&lt;ref&gt;“Maximianus Galerius in Dacia haud longe a Serdica natus”, Eutropii Breviarum IX. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; though some modern scholars consider the strategic site where he later built his palace named after his mother –  [[Gamzigrad|Felix Romuliana]] ([[Gamzigrad]]) – his birth and funeral place.&lt;ref name= &quot;Barnes, New Empire, p. 37&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''New Empire'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Thracians|Thracian]] and his mother Romula was a [[Dacians|Dacian]] woman, who left [[Dacia]] because of the [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpians]]' attacks.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lactantius Persecutorum&quot;&gt;{{citation |last = Lactantius |title = de Mortibus Persecutorum}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |19}}  He originally followed his father's occupation, that of a herdsman, where he got his surname of Armentarius ([[Latin]]: ''armentum'', herd).

He served with distinction as a soldier under Emperors [[Aurelian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]], and in 293 at the establishment of the [[Tetrarchy]], was designated ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' along with [[Constantius Chlorus]], receiving in marriage [[Diocletian]]'s daughter Valeria (later known as Galeria Valeria), and at the same time being entrusted with the care of the [[Illyria]]n provinces. After a few years campaigning against [[Sarmatians]] and [[Goths]] on the [[Danube]], he received command of the legions on the eastern Imperial limits. Soon after his appointment, Galerius would be dispatched to Egypt to fight the rebellious cities [[Busiris]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=March 2015}} and [[Qift|Coptos]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', p. 14, citing William Leadbetter, &quot;Galerius and the Revolt of the Thebaid, 293/4,&quot; ''Antichthon'' 34 (2000) 82–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Persia==
{{See also|Roman relations with the Parthians and Sassanids|Roman-Persian Wars}}

===Invasion, counterinvasion===
In 294, [[Narseh]], a son of [[Shapur I]] who had been passed over for the Sassanid succession, came into power in Persia. Narseh probably moved to eliminate [[Bahram III]], a young man installed by a noble named Vahunam in the wake of Bahram II's death in 293.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter Empire&quot;/&gt;{{rp |292}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams Diocletian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |69}}  In early 294, Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts, but within Persia he was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors, erasing their names from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike reigns of [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]] (r. 226–41) and [[Shapur I|Shapur]] (r. 241–72), who had sacked Roman Antioch and captured Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams Diocletian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |69–70}}

In 295 or 296, Narseh declared war on Rome. He appears to have first invaded western Armenia, retaking the lands delivered to Tiridates in the peace of 287. He would occupy the lands there until the following year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Potter Empire&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Southern Severus&quot; /&gt;{{rp |149}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes Constantine 17&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |292}}&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus 23.5.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The late historian Ammianus Marcellinus is the only source detailing the initial invasion of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Potter |year = 2004 |pages = 651–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern (1999, 149) dates the invasion to 295; Barnes (1982, 17, 293) mentions an earlier, unsuccessful invasion by Narseh based on the fact that the title ''Persici Maximi'' was given to all four emperors; Odahl (2004, 59) concurs with Barnes and suggests that Saracen princes in the Syrian desert collaborated with Narseh's invasion.  Narseh then moved south into Roman Mesopotamia, where he inflicted a severe defeat on Galerius, then commander of the Eastern forces, in the region between Carrhae ([[Harran]], Turkey) and Callinicum ([[Ar-Raqqah]], Syria).&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes Constantine 17&quot; /&gt;  Diocletian may or may not have been present at the battle,&lt;ref name = &quot;Potter Empire&quot; /&gt;{{rp |652}} but would present himself soon afterwards at Antioch, where the official version of events was made clear: Galerius was to take all the blame for the affair.  In Antioch, Diocletian forced Galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperor.&lt;ref name = &quot;Potter Empire&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes Constantine 17&quot; /&gt;{{rp |292–3}}  The message conveyed was clear: the loss at Carrhae was not due to the failings of the empire's soldiers, but due to the failings of their commander, and Galerius' failures would not be accepted.&lt;ref name= &quot;P293&quot;&gt;Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that Galerius' position at the head of the caravan was merely the conventional organization of an imperial progression, designed to show a Caesar's deference to his Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arch-of-Galerius-1.jpg|right|thumb|Detail of Galerius attacking [[Narseh]] on the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius#Arch of Galerius|Arch of Galerius]] at [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], the city where Galerius carried out most of his administrative actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern Severus&quot; /&gt;{{rp |151}}]]

Galerius had been reinforced, probably in the spring of 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's Danubian holdings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Narseh did not advance from Armenia and Mesopotamia, leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia.&lt;ref name = &quot;P293&quot; /&gt; Diocletian may or may not have been present to assist the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius (''DMP'' 9.6) derides Diocletian for his absence from the front; Southern (1999, 151, 335–36), on the basis of a dating of the African campaigns one year earlier than that given by Barnes, places him at Galerius' southern flank.  Southern sees the Persian campaign progressing along the lines of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' (r. 161–80) earlier, unsuccessful [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–66|Parthian campaign]], which also had an emperor manning the southern flank.&lt;/ref&gt; Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius' force, to Narseh's disadvantage: the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces, and, in two successive battles, Galerius secured victories over Narseh.&lt;ref name = &quot;P293&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot;/&gt;

During the second encounter, the [[Battle of Satala (298)|Battle of Satala]] in 298, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife.&lt;ref name = &quot;P293&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot; /&gt;  Narseh's wife would live out the remainder of the war in Daphne, a suburb of Antioch, serving as a constant reminder to the Persians of the Roman victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;P293&quot;/&gt; Galerius advanced into [[Medes|Media]] and [[Adiabene]], winning continuous victories, most prominently near [[Erzurum|Theodosiopolis]] (Erzurum),&lt;ref name= &quot;Southern Severus&quot; /&gt;{{rp |151}} and securing [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] (Nusaybin) before 1 October  298. He moved down the [[Tigris]], taking [[Ctesiphon]], and gazing onwards to the ruins of [[Babylon]] before returning to Roman territory via the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot; /&gt; No source ever specifically claims that Ctesiphon was sacked, but it is assumed to have been, primarily due to the seizure of Narseh's wife and harem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern Severus&quot;/&gt;{{rp |150}}

===Peace negotiations===
Narseh had previously sent an ambassador to Galerius to plead for the return of his wife and children, but Galerius had dismissed this ambassador, reminding him of how Shapur had treated Valerian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot;/&gt; The Romans, in any case, treated Narseh's captured family with tact, perhaps seeking to evoke comparisons to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and his beneficent conduct towards the family of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P293&quot;/&gt; Peace negotiations began in the spring of 299, with both Diocletian and Galerius presiding. Their ''magister memoriae'' (secretary) Sicorius Probus was sent to Narseh to present terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot;/&gt;

The conditions of the [[Peace of Nisibis]] were heavy:&lt;ref name=&quot;P293&quot;/&gt; Persia would give up territory to Rome, making the Tigris the boundary between the two empires.  Further terms specified that Armenia was returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; [[Caucasian Iberia]] would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: [[Ingilene]], Sophanene ([[Sophene]]), Arzanene ([[Aghdznik]]), [[Corduene]], and [[Zabdicene]] (near modern [[Hakkâri]], Turkey). These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains|Anti-Taurus]] range; the [[Bitlis]] pass, the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia; and access to the [[Tur Abdin]] plateau. With these territories, Rome would have an advance station north of Ctesiphon, and would be able to slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region.&lt;ref&gt;The acceptance of these terms by the Persians also meant that Syriac culture would earn long-term influence in the region on both sides of the Tigris. With the heavily Christian Syriac peoples so near their border, Armenia would also become susceptible to Christian influence in later years, leading to its eventual conversion under Tiridates. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the peace Tiridates would regain both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim, and Rome would secure a wide zone of cultural influence in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, p. 18&quot;/&gt; The fact that the empire was able to sustain such constant warfare on so many fronts has been taken as a sign of the essential efficacy of the Diocletianic system and the goodwill of the army towards the tetrarchic enterprise.&lt;ref name = &quot;Southern Severus&quot; /&gt;{{rp |150}}

==Persecution of Christians==
{{Main|Diocletian Persecution}}

[[File:Thessaloniki-Arch of Galerius (detail).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Arch of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]].]]

Christians had lived in peace during most of the rule of Diocletian. The persecutions that began with an edict of February 24, 303, were credited by Christians to Galerius' work, as he was a fierce advocate of the old ways and old gods.  Christian houses of assembly were destroyed, for fear of sedition in secret gatherings.

[[Diocletian]] was not anti-Christian during the first part of his reign, and historians have claimed that Galerius decided to prod him into persecuting them by secretly burning the Imperial Palace and blaming it on Christian saboteurs. Regardless of who was at fault for the fire, Diocletian's rage was aroused and he began one of the last and greatest Christian persecutions in the history of the [[Roman Empire]].

It was at the insistence of Galerius that the last edicts of persecution against the [[Christian]]s were published, beginning on February 24, 303, and this policy of repression was maintained by him until the appearance of the general edict of toleration, issued from [[Nicomedia]] in April 311, apparently during his last bout of illness (see ''[[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]]''). Initially one of the leading figures in the persecutions, Galerius later admitted that the policy of trying to eradicate Christianity had failed, saying:  &quot;wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the republic may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.&quot; [[Lactantius]] gives the text of the edict in his moralized chronicle of the bad ends to which all the persecutors came, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Lactantius |title = De Mortibus Persecutorum |trans_title = On the Deaths of the Persecutors |chapter = 34, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of official persecution of Christians. Christianity was officially legalized in the [[Roman Empire]] two years later in 313 by Constantine and [[Licinius]] in the [[Edict of Milan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Canduci Triumph&quot; /&gt;{{rp |125}}

==Rule as Augustus==
[[File:Galerius RIC Alexandria 79 obv.jpg|thumb|Follis of Galerius]]

After the elevation of [[Constantius I]] and Galerius to the rank of Augusti, two new Caesars were required to supply their place, and to complete the system of the Imperial government.  The two persons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Caesar were very much Galerius' creatures, and he hoped to enhance his authority throughout the empire with their elevation.&lt;ref name = &quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{citation |last = Gibbon |first = Edward |title = Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter = 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

First was [[Maximinus II|Maximinus Daia]], whose mother was Galerius' sister. An inexperienced youth with little formal education, he was invested with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Caesar, and assigned the command of Egypt and Syria. Second was [[Severus II|Severus]], Galerius' comrade in arms; he was sent to [[Milan]] to receive the possession of Italy and Africa. According to the forms of the constitution, Severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western emperor; but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius, who, reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of Italy to those of Syria, firmly established his power over three quarters of the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

His hopes were dashed when his colleague Constantius died at [[York]] in 306 and the legions elevated his son [[Constantine I|Constantine]] to the position of Augustus. Galerius only discovered this when he received a letter from Constantine, who informed him of his father's death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession, and respectfully lamented that the enthusiastic violence of his troops had not allowed him to obtain the Imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner. The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise, disappointment, and rage; and, as he could seldom restrain his passions, he threatened to burn both the letter and the messenger.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''CE'', 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

But when he had time to reconsider his position, he inevitably saw that his chances of winning a war against Constantine was doubtful at best, especially given that he was well aware of Constantine’s strengths as Constantine had been his guest for some time at [[Nicomedia]], not to mention the attachment of the troops to him.&lt;ref name = &quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;  Therefore, without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the ruler of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite Severus.

The ambitious spirit of Galerius was only just over this disappointment when he beheld the unexpected loss of Italy to [[Maxentius]], who was married to his daughter [[Valeria Maximilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/maxentiu.htm |title=Maxentius (306-312 A.D.) |last=DiMaio, Jr. |first=Michael |work=De Imperatoribus Romanis: An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Rulers and Their Families |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius’ need for additional revenue had persuaded him to make a very strict and rigorous examination of the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation. A very minute survey was taken of their real estates and, wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment, torture was used to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth. Italy had traditionally been exempt from any form of taxation, but Galerius ignored this precedent, and the officers of the revenue already began to number the Roman people, and to settle the proportion of the new taxes. Italy began to murmur against this indignity and Maxentius used this sentiment to declare himself emperor in Italy, to the fury of Galerius. Therefore, Galerius ordered his colleague Severus to immediately march to Rome, in the full confidence that, by his unexpected arrival, he would easily suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Severus was captured after his troops deserted to their old commander [[Maximian]], who had once again been elevated to the rank of co-emperor, this time by his son Maxentius. Severus was later executed.

The importance of the occasion needed the presence and abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army collected from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and the East, he entered Italy, determined to avenge Severus and to punish the rebellious Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci Triumph&quot;/&gt;{{rp |122}}  But due to the skill of Maximian, Galerius found every place hostile, fortified, and inaccessible; and though he forced his way as far as [[Narni]], within sixty miles of Rome, his control in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp.

Seeing that he was facing ever-greater difficulties, Galerius made the first advances towards reconciliation, and dispatched two officers to tempt the Romans by the offer of a conference, and the declaration of his paternal regard for Maxentius, reminding them that they would obtain much more from his willing generosity than anything that might have been obtained through a military campaign.  The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness, his friendship refused, and it was not long before he discovered that unless he retreated, he might have succumbed to the fate of Severus. It was not a moment too soon; large monetary gifts from Maxentius to his soldiers had corrupted the fidelity of the Illyrian legions. When Galerius finally began his withdrawal from Italy, it was only with great difficulty that he managed to stop his veterans deserting him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In frustration, Galerius allowed his legions to ravage the countryside as they passed northwards. Maxentius declined to make a general engagement.

With so many emperors now in existence, in 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the now active Maximian, called an imperial 'conference' at [[Carnuntum]] on the River Danube to rectify the situation and bring some order back into the imperial government.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canduci Triumph&quot; /&gt;{{rp |120}}  Here it was agreed that Galerius’ long-time friend and military companion [[Licinius]], who had been entrusted by Galerius with the defense of the Danube while Galerius was in Italy, would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper.

Galerius’ plan soon failed. The news of Licinius’ promotion was no sooner carried into the East, than Maximinus, who governed the provinces of Egypt and Syria, rejected his position as Caesar, and, notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius, exacted the equal title of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; For the first, and indeed for the last time, six emperors administered the Roman world. And though the opposition of interest, and the memory of a recent war, divided the empire into two great hostile powers, their mutual fears and the fading authority of Galerius produced an apparent tranquility in the imperial government.

The last years of Galerius saw him relinquishing his aspirations towards being the supreme emperor of the empire, though he managed to retain the position of first among equals. He spent the remainder of his years enjoying himself and ordering some important public works, such as discharging into the [[Danube]] the superfluous waters of [[Lake Pelso]], and cutting down the immense forests that encompassed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
Galerius died in late April or early May 311&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Corcoran |first = Simon |title = The empire of the tetrarchs: imperial pronouncements and government, AD 284–324 |page = 187}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from a horribly gruesome disease described by [[Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'' 352-356&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lactantius]],&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorem'' 33&lt;/ref&gt; possibly some form of [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]], [[gangrene]] or [[Fournier gangrene]].

Galerius was buried in his [[mausoleum]] at [[Gamzigrad-Romuliana]], which was part of the palace he built at his birthplace, today's [[Zaječar]] in [[Serbia]]. The entire site has been inscribed into the [[World Heritage List]] in June 2007.

==Anti-Roman accusations==
According to [[Lactantius]], Galerius affirmed his Dacian identity and avowed himself the enemy of the Roman name once made emperor, even proposing that the empire should be called, not the Roman, but the Dacian Empire, much to the horror of the patricians and senators. He exhibited anti-Roman attitude as soon as he had attained the highest power, treating the Roman citizens with ruthless cruelty, like the conquerors treated the conquered, all in the name of the same treatment that the victorious [[Trajan]] had applied to the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|conquered Dacians]], forefathers of Galerius, two centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;Lactanius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcus Aurelius Mausaeus Valerius Carausius''' (died 293) was a military commander of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 3rd century. He was a [[Menapii|Menapian]] from [[Gallia Belgica|Belgic Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carausius, Marcus Aurelius}}&lt;/ref&gt; who [[Roman usurper|usurped]] power in 286, during the [[Carausian Revolt]], declaring himself emperor in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and northern [[Gaul]]. He did this only 13 years after the [[Gallic Empire]] of the [[Batavii|Batavian]] [[Postumus]] was ended in 273. He held power for seven years, before being assassinated by his finance minister [[Allectus]].

==History==
Carausius was of humble origin, a [[Menapii|Menapian]] who distinguished himself during [[Maximian]]'s campaign against the [[Bagaudae]] rebels in northern [[Gaul]] in 286. This success, and his former occupation as a [[Harbour pilot|pilot]], led to his appointment to command the ''[[Classis Britannica]]'', a fleet based in the [[English Channel]], with the responsibility of eliminating [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] pirates who had been raiding the coasts of [[Armorica]] and [[Belgica]]. He was suspected of keeping captured treasure for himself, and of allowing pirates to carry out raids and enrich themselves before taking action against them, and Maximian ordered his execution. In late 286 or early 287 Carausius learned of this sentence and responded by declaring himself Emperor in Britain and northern Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. V. Nixon &amp; Barbara Saylor Rodgers (ed &amp; trans), ''In Praise of Later Roman Emperors: The [[Panegyrici Latini]]'', University of California Press, 1994, 8:6; [[Aurelius Victor]], ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39:20-21]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21]; [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'' [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7:25.2-4]&lt;/ref&gt; His forces comprised not only his fleet, augmented by new ships he had built, and the three [[Roman legion|legions]] stationed in Britain, but a legion he had seized in Gaul, a number of foreign [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units, a levy of Gaulish merchant ships, and barbarian mercenaries attracted by the prospect of booty.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8:12&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian and archaeologist [[Sheppard Frere]] wonders how Carausius was able to win support from the army when his command had been sea-based, and speculates that he had perhaps been involved in an unrecorded victory in Britain, connected with [[Diocletian]]'s assumption of the title ''Britannicus Maximus'' in 285, and signs of destruction in Romano-British towns at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: a History of Roman Britain'', third edition, Pimlico, 1987, pp. 326-327&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign against the [[Bagaudae]], however, was evidently land-based, and may have been responsible for Carausius's popularity with the army. Equally, if the accusations of larceny are true, he could perhaps have afforded to buy their loyalty.

Maximian prepared an invasion of Britain in 288 or 289 to oust him,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 10:12.1&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed. A [[Panegyrici Latini|panegyric]] delivered to [[Constantius Chlorus]] attributes this failure to bad weather, but notes that Carausius claimed a military victory.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8:12.2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] says that hostilities were in vain thanks to Carausius's military skill, and peace was agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#22 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Carausius began to entertain visions of legitimacy and official recognition. He minted his own coins and brought their value into line with Roman issues as well as acknowledging and honouring Maximian and then [[Diocletian]]. Coinage is the main source of information about the rogue emperor; his issues were initially crude but soon became more elaborate and were issued from mints in [[Roman London|Londinium]], [[Rouen|Rotomagus]] and a third site, possibly [[Camulodunum|Colonia Claudia Victricensis]]. 

Carausius appears to have appealed to native British dissatisfaction with Roman rule; he issued coins with legends such as ''Restitutor Britanniae'' (Restorer of Britain) and ''Genius Britanniae'' (Spirit of Britain). He also used coins for more sophisticated propaganda. He issued the first proper silver coins that had appeared in the [[Roman Empire]] for generations, knowing that good quality bullion coinage would enhance his legitimacy and make him look more successful than [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]]. Some of these silver coins bear the legend ''Expectate veni'', 'Come long-awaited one', recognised to allude to a line in the [[Aeneid]] by the Augustan poet [[Virgil]], written more than 300 years previously. He was trying to suggest that not only was he, Carausius, a kind of messianic new ruler, but was also showing his association with Roman culture rather than any kind of remote provincial culture. 

Some of the silver coins bear the legend RSR in the [[exergue]] (an area on a coin below the legend). This was considered a mystery for some time. Two Carausian medallions, now in the [[British Museum]] have also been found. One has RSR in the exergue; the other has INPCDA. Since 1998 these letters have been recognised as representing the sixth and seventh lines of the Fourth [[Eclogue]] of Virgil, which reads ''Redeunt Saturnia Regna, Iam Nova Progenies Caelo Demittitur Alto'', meaning 'The Golden Ages are back, now a new generation is let down from Heaven above'. This poem was as famous in the Roman world as [[Shakespeare]]'s works are today, so any educated reader would certainly have realized what the initials stood for (it was commonplace in antiquity to reduce slogans and phrases to abbreviations).&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy de la Bédoyère]], 'Carausius and the Marks RSR and INPCDA' in ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 158 (1998), pp. 79-88&lt;/ref&gt; No other Roman emperor in history ever made such an explicit reference to famous Roman literature. It is quite extraordinary that in a remote province like Britain a rebel emperor should utilise such a method to appeal to his public. He was claiming to represent a revival of traditional Roman virtues and the great traditions of the Empire as established by [[Augustus]] in the last decades of the first century BC, not in [[Rome]] but in Britain.

A milestone from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] with his name on it suggests that the whole of [[Roman Britain]] was in Carausius's grasp.&lt;ref&gt;Frere, ''Britannia'', p. 327-328&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription reads (with expansions in square brackets) &quot;IMP[eratori] C[aesari] M[arco] |AVR[elio] MAVS[aeo] |CARAVSIO P[io] F[elici] |INVICTO AVG[usto]&quot;, this translates as &quot;For the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Mausaeus Carausius Pius Felix Invictus Augustus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIB 2291. Milestone of Carausius&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=RIB 2291. Milestone of Carausius|url=http://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/2291|website=http://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org|publisher=Roman Inscriptions of Britain|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title indicates he considered himself equal to the [[Tetrarchy]]'s ''senior'' emperors (''[[augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]''), rather than their subordinate junior emperors (''[[caesar (title)|Caesares]]''). The milestone was reused in about 306, burying the first inscription and adding a new one at the other end, which translates as &quot;For Flavius Valerius Constantinus, most noble Caesar&quot; and refers to [[Constantius Chlorus|Marcus Flavius Valerius Constantius Herculius Augustus]] (Constantius I).&lt;ref name=&quot;RIB 2292.

It has also been suggested that Carausius may have been responsible for the series of fortifications on both sides of the [[English Channel]] known as the [[Saxon Shore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D A White&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Donald A|title=Litus Saxonicum: the British Saxon Shore in Scholarship and History.|date=1961|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fields&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fields|first1=Nic|title=Rome's Saxon Shore - Coastal Defences of Roman Britain AD 250-500 (Fortress 56)|date=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-094-9|pages=42-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation continued until 293, when [[Constantius Chlorus]] (Constantius I), now the western Caesar, marched into Gaul and reclaimed it for the empire. He isolated Carausius by besieging the port of [[Gesoriacum]] ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]), and invading [[Batavia (region)|Batavia]] in the Rhine delta, securing his rear against Carausius's [[Franks|Frankish]] allies. He could not yet mount an invasion of Britain until a suitable fleet could be built.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6:5, 8.6-8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Carausius's grip on power was fatally undermined. [[Allectus]], whom he had put in charge of his treasury, assassinated him and assumed power himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8:12; Aurelius Victor, ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39.40]; Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#22 22]; Orosius, ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'' [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7:25.6]&lt;/ref&gt; His reign would last only three years, after which he was defeated and killed by Constantius' subordinate [[Julius Asclepiodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#22 9.22]; Aurelius Victor, ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39.42]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Geograph-1839339-by-Richard-Hoare.jpg|thumb|left|Carausius Stone in Penmachno]]
A stone slab bearing his name in the Latin inscription &quot;CARAVSIVS HIC IACIT IN HOC CONGERIES LAPIDVM&quot; (translation: &quot;Carausius lies here in this lump/heap of stones&quot;) with the [[Chi Rho]] symbol was found in 1856 when a derelict church was being dismantled in [[Penmachno]], an early Christian settlement; it is now in the church built on the same site.&lt;ref name=PMCH1/1&gt;{{cite web|title=PMCH1/1|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/pmch1_1.html|website=http://www.ucl.ac.uk|publisher=University College London|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested this slab was his grave stone or was placed on top of his cairn/mound. 

In April 2010 a large [[Frome Hoard|hoard of coins]] was unearthed near [[Frome]], [[Somerset]], [[United Kingdom]], which includes the largest group of coins issued during Carausius's reign ever found; 760 coins from his reign were found in a group of 52,500 Roman coins that also included 5 rare silver denarii. The find was equivalent to four years' pay for a Roman legionary and dates from later than his reign, however, as it includes coins struck at a later date.&lt;ref name=pas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finds.org.uk/blogs/fromehoard/ |title=The Frome Hoard |publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
In [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s legendary ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (1136) Carausius is a Briton of humble birth, who by his courage persuades the [[Roman Senate]] to give him command of a fleet to defend Britain from barbarian attack. Once given the fleet, however, he sails around Britain stirring up unrest, and raises an army against [[Caracalla|Bassanius]], the historical Caracalla, here a king of Britain. Carausius defeats Bassanius by persuading his [[Pict]]ish allies to desert him in exchange for grants of land in Scotland, and sets himself up as king. Hearing of Carausius's treachery, the Romans send [[Allectus]] to Britain with three legions. Allectus defeats and kills Carausius and sets himself up as king in his place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5#3|5.3-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that he is the saint [[List of Welsh saints|Caron]] associated with [[Tregaron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint Caradoc - Caron&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llwyd|first1=Richard|last2=Wynne|first2=W|last3=Saint Caradoc of Llancarvan|title=The History of Wales|date=1832|publisher=John Eddowes|location=Shrewsbury|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in the translation from Welsh, rather than Latin &quot;there was a young man of the name of Caron, of a British family, but of low degree, who... went to Rome, and solicited the Senate to grant him permission and aid to protect the sea coasts of Britain... [He] proposed to the Britons that they should make him king... Allectus with three legions... overpowered him...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caron - Geoffrey of Monmouth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geoffrey of Monmouth|last2=Roberts|first2=Peter|title=The Chronicle of the Kings of Britain|date=1811|publisher=E Williams|location=London|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'A Topographical Dictionary of Wales' describes the origin of Tregaron's name as follows: &quot;It is said to derive its name from being the burial-place of Caron, a Welsh king, who, according to tradition, from a low situation in life, raised himself, by his bravery and generous deportment, to the sovereignty, which he held for seven years; after his death, he was canonized, and became the tutelar saint of the church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Samuel|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales|date=1849|location=London|pages=396-405|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/wales/pp396-405#h3-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-year rule of Allectus was oppressive and this was followed by [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution of the Christians]] by Carausius's enemy [[Diocletian]] from 303 during Asclepiodotus' rule, making Carausius something close to a martyr from the point of view of the Christians.

'''Allectus''' (died 296) was a [[Britannic Empire|Roman-Britannic]] [[Roman usurper|usurper]]-[[Roman emperors|emperor]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and northern [[Gaul]] from 293 to 296.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Schmitz |first = Leonhard |authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz |title = Allectus |editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume = 1 |pages = 132 |publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] |location = Boston |year = 1867 |url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Allectus was treasurer to [[Carausius]], a [[Menapii|Menapian]] officer in the Roman navy who had seized power in Britain and northern Gaul in 286. In 293 Carausius was isolated when the western [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], [[Constantius Chlorus]], retook some of his Gallic territories, particularly the crucial port of Bononia (modern [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]), and defeated his [[Franks|Frankish]] allies in [[Batavians|Batavia]]. Allectus assassinated [[Carausius]] and assumed command himself.
[[File:Constantius I capturing London after defeating Allectus Beaurains hoard.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Medal of [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius I]] capturing [[London]] (inscribed as LON) after defeating Allectus. [[Beaurains Treasure|Beaurains hoard]].]]
His reign has left little record, although his coin issues display a similar distribution to those of Carausius. They are found in north western Gaul, indicating that the recapture of Bononia did not spell the end of the rebel empire on that side of the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', third edition, 1987, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius launched an invasion to depose him in September 296. His forces sailed in several divisions. Constantius led one division from Bononia, but seems to have been delayed by bad weather. Another division, under the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]], took advantage of fog to avoid Allectus's ships stationed at the [[Isle of Wight]], and landed near [[Southampton Water]], where they burnt their ships. Allectus's forces were forced to retreat from the coast, but were cut off by another of Constantius's divisions and defeated. Allectus himself was killed in the battle, having removed all insignia in the hope that his body would not be identified. Archaeology suggests that [[Calleva Atrebatum]] ([[Silchester]]) was the site of his defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Frere, ''Britannia'' p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Roman troops, who had been separated from the main body by the fog during the channel crossing, caught up with the remnants of Allectus's men, mostly Franks, at Londinium ([[London]]), and massacred them. Constantius himself, it seems, did not reach Britain until it was all over, and his [[Panegyrici Latini|panegyrist]] claims he was welcomed by the Britons as a liberator.&lt;ref name=&quot;sources&quot;&gt;''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' 8:12-19; [[Aurelius Victor]], ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21-22]; [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'' [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7:25]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carausius had deliberately used his coinage for propaganda purposes, and some of his slogans, such as a claim to have restored 'liberty', were designed to appeal to British sentiment.  Constantius answered such claims in a famous medal struck on the morrow of his victory, in which he described himself as ''redditor lucis aeternae'', 'restorer of the eternal light (viz. of Rome).'

==Legend==
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] included Allectus in his legendary ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (ca. 1136). Here, Allectus is an officer sent with three legions by the Romans to depose [[Carausius]], a native British king. He does so, but his rule proves oppressive, and he is in turn deposed by Asclepiodotus, here the duke of Cornwall. The last of Allectus's troops are besieged in London, and surrender on the condition they are granted safe passage out of Britain. Asclepiodotus agrees, but the surrendering soldiers are massacred, and their heads thrown into the river [[Walbrook|Galobroc]], by his allies the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Venedoti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5#4|5.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucius Domitius Domitianus''' was a [[Roman usurper]] against [[Diocletian]], who seized power for a short time in [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Aegyptus]].

Domitianus revolted against Diocletian in 297 AD, but died in December of the same year, when Diocletian went to Aegyptus to quell with the revolt. Numismatic and papyrological evidence support Domitianus' claim for the purple. It is possible that the rebellion was sparked by a new tax edict, but this uncertain.

It is possible that Domitianus' ''[[corrector]]'', [[Aurelius Achilleus]], who was responsible for the defence of [[Alexandria]], succeeded Domitianus' claim for the purple; in fact, only in March 298 Diocletian re-conquered the city.

'''Severus II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valerius Severus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Severus' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS VALERIVS SEVERVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; died September 307), was a [[Western Roman Emperor]] from 306 to 307. After failing to besiege Rome, he fled to [[Ravenna]]. It is thought that he was killed here or executed near Rome.

== Officer in the Roman army ==
Severus was of humble birth, born in Northern [[Illyria]] around the middle of the third century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/severus.htm|author=Michael DiMalo|publisher=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|year=1998|title=Severus II|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abtcs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientrome.ru/antlitr/aur-vict/caesar-f.htm|language=Russian|title=Aurelius Victor, About Caesar|publisher=Ancient Rome|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to become a senior officer in the Roman army,&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;/&gt; and as an old friend of [[Galerius]], that emperor ordered that Severus be appointed ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' of the [[Western Roman Empire]], a post that he succeeded to on 1 May 305.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancrom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientrome.ru/antlitr/t.htm?a=1333303444|language=Russian|title=Biography of Emperor Constantine|publisher=Ancient Rome|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus served as deputy-emperor to [[Constantius I]] ([[Constantius Chlorus]]), ''[[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augustus]]'' of the western half of empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;/&gt;

== Augustus, 306–307 ==
On the death of Constantius I in Britain in the summer of 306, Severus was promoted to ''Augustus'' by [[Galerius]], in opposition to the acclamation of [[Constantine I]] (Constantius' son) by his own soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The New Empire of Diocletian and Constantine|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-7837-2221-4|pp=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lact1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://students.gf.nsu.ru/latin/lactanz.html|title=On the death of the persecutors|author=Lactantius|page=5|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Maxentius]], the son of the retired emperor [[Maximian]], revolted at [[Rome]], Galerius sent Severus to suppress the rebellion. Severus moved towards Rome from his capital, [[Mediolanum]], at the head of an army previously commanded by Maximian.&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;/&gt; Fearing the arrival of Severus, Maxentius offered Maximian the co-rule of the empire. Maximian accepted, and when Severus arrived under the walls of Rome and besieged it, his men deserted to Maximian, their old commander. Severus fled to [[Ravenna]], an impregnable position.&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;/&gt; Maximian offered to spare his life and treat him humanely if he surrendered peaceably, which he did in March or April 307. Despite Maximian's assurance, Severus was nonetheless displayed as a captive and later imprisoned at [[Tres Tabernae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dimalo&quot;/&gt; One belief is that when Galerius himself invaded Italy to suppress Maxentius and Maximian, the former ordered Severus's death, and that he was executed  (or forced to commit suicide) on 16 September 307 at ''Tres Tabernae'', near the current [[Cisterna di Latina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abtcs&quot;/&gt; Another belief is that Severus II was killed in Ravenna.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancrom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baronio, ''Annales Ecclesiastici'', vol. 1, pp. 769-770&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus was survived by his son [[Flavius Severianus]].

:''This article deals with this 4th-century Roman Emperor. For the 3rd-century Roman Emperor of the same name, see: [[Maximinus Thrax]]. For other uses of the name, see [[Maximin (disambiguation)|Maximin]].''
'''Maximinus II''' ({{lang-la|Gaius Valerius Galerius Maximinus Daia Augustus}}; c. 20 November 270 – July or August 313), also known as '''Maximinus Daia''' or '''Maximinus Daza''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 308 to 313. He became embroiled in the [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy]] between rival claimants for control of the empire, in which he was defeated by [[Licinius]]. A committed pagan, he engaged in one of the last [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecutions of Christians]].

==Early career==
He was born of [[Dacians|Dacian]] peasant stock to the sister of the emperor [[Galerius]] near their family lands around [[Felix Romuliana]], a rural area then in the Danubian region of [[Moesia]], now [[Eastern Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-colosseum.info/roman-emperors/maximinus-daza.htm Roman Colosseum, Maximinus Daza]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He rose to high distinction after joining the army.

In 305, his maternal uncle [[Galerius]] became the eastern Augustus and adopted Maximinus, raising him to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|caesar]] (in effect, the junior eastern Emperor), and granting him the government of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].

==Civil war==
In 308, after the elevation of [[Licinius]] to [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]], Maximinus and [[Constantine I|Constantine]] were declared ''filii Augustorum'' (&quot;sons of the Augusti&quot;), but Maximinus probably started styling himself after Augustus during a campaign against the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in 310. On the death of Galerius in 311, Maximinus divided the Eastern Empire between Licinius and himself. When Licinius and [[Constantine I|Constantine]] began to make common cause, Maximinus entered into a secret alliance with the usurper  Caesar [[Maxentius]], who controlled Italy. He came to an open rupture with Licinius in 313; he summoned an army of 70,000 men but sustained a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Tzirallum]] in the neighbourhood of [[Heraclea Perinthus]] on April 30. He fled, first to [[Nicomedia]] and afterwards to [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]], where he died the following August. His death was variously ascribed &quot;to despair, to poison, and to the divine justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Gibbon, Edward, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution of Christians==
Maximinus has a bad name in [[Christianity|Christian]] annals for renewing their persecution after the publication of the ''[[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]]'', acting in response to the demands of various urban authorities asking to expel Christians. In one [[rescript]] replying to a petition made by the inhabitants of [[Tyre,_Lebanon|Tyre]], transcribed by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]] , IX, 8-9 ; Eng. trans. available at [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250109.htm]. Accessed August 2 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Maximinus expounds an unusual pagan orthodoxy, explaining that it is through &quot;the kindly care of the gods&quot; that one could hope for good crops, health, and the peaceful sea, and that not being the case, one should blame &quot;the destructive error of the empty vanity of those impious men [that] weighed down the whole world with shame&quot;. In one extant inscription ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] III.12132, from [[Arycanda]]) from the cities of [[Lycia]] and [[Pamphylia]] asking for the interdiction of the Christians, Maximinus replied, in another inscription, by expressing his hope that &quot;may those [...] who, after being freed from [...] those by-ways [...] rejoice [as] snatched from a grave illness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook, ''The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco-Roman Paganism''. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000, ISBN 3-16-147195-4 , page 304, footnote 175&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the victory of Constantine over Maxentius, however, Maximinus wrote to the Praetorian Prefect Sabinus that it was better to &quot;recall our provincials to the worship of the gods rather by exhortations and flatteries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', IX, 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, on the eve of his clash with Licinius, he accepted Galerius' edict; after being defeated by Licinius, shortly before his death at Tarsus, he issued an edict of tolerance on his own, granting Christians the rights of assembling, of building churches, and the restoration of their confiscated properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', X, 7-11&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Eusebius on Maximinus==
The Christian writer [[Eusebius]] claims that Maximinus was consumed by avarice and superstition. He also allegedly lived a highly dissolute lifestyle: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;And he went to such an excess of folly and drunkenness that his mind was deranged and crazed in his carousals; and he gave commands when intoxicated of which he repented afterward when sober. He suffered no one to surpass him in debauchery and profligacy, but made himself an instructor in wickedness to those about him, both rulers and subjects. He urged on the army to live wantonly in every kind of revelry and intemperance, and encouraged the governors and generals to abuse their subjects with rapacity and covetousness, almost as if they were rulers with him.&lt;br&gt;
Why need we relate the licentious, shameless deeds of the man, or enumerate the multitude with whom he committed adultery? For he could not pass through a city without continually corrupting women and ravishing virgins.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', VIII, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eusebius, only Christians resisted him. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the men endured fire and sword and crucifixion and wild beasts and the depths of the sea, and cutting off of limbs, and burnings, and pricking and digging out of eyes, and mutilations of the entire body, and besides these, hunger and mines and bonds. In all they showed patience in behalf of religion rather than transfer to idols the reverence due to [[God]].
&lt;br&gt;
And the women were not less manly than the men in behalf of the teaching of the Divine Word, as they endured conflicts with the men, and bore away equal prizes of virtue. And when they were dragged away for corrupt purposes, they surrendered their lives to death rather than their bodies to impurity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He refers to one high-born Christian woman who rejected his advances. He exiled her and seized all of her wealth and assets.&lt;ref name=EncSanti&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/39650 Enciclopedia dei Santi: Santa Dorotea di Alessandria]&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius does not give the girl a name, but [[Tyrannius Rufinus]] calls her &quot;Dorothea,&quot; and writes that she fled to [[Arabia]]. This story may have evolved into the legend of [[Dorothea of Alexandria]]. [[Caesar Baronius]] identified the girl in Eusebius' account with [[Catherine of Alexandria]], but the [[Bollandists]] rejected this theory.&lt;ref name=EncSanti/&gt;

:''For the saint of the same name see [[Saint Maxentius]]''
'''Maxentius''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maxentius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Maxentius' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS VALERIVS MAXENTIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 278 – 28 October 312) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 306 to 312. He was the son of former Emperor [[Maximian]] and the son-in-law of Emperor [[Galerius]].

==Life==

===Birth and early life===
Maxentius' exact date of birth is unknown; it was probably around 278. He was the son of the Emperor [[Maximian]] and his wife [[Eutropia]].

As his father became emperor in 285, he was regarded as crown prince who would eventually follow his father on the throne. He seems not to have served, however, in any important military or administrative position during the reign of [[Diocletian]] and his father. The exact date of his marriage to [[Valeria Maximilla]], daughter of [[Galerius]], is unknown. He had two sons, [[Valerius Romulus]] (ca. 295 – 309) and an unknown one.

In 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated, and the former ''[[Caesar (title)|caesares]]'' [[Constantius I Chlorus|Constantius]] and [[Galerius]] became [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]. Although two sons of emperors were available, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and Maxentius, they were passed over for the new [[tetrarchy]], and [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus Daia]] were appointed Caesars. [[Lactantius]]' ''Epitome'' states that Galerius hated Maxentius and used his influence with Diocletian to see that Maxentius was ignored in the succession; perhaps Diocletian also thought Maxentius was not qualified for the military duties of the imperial office. Maxentius retired to an estate some miles from [[Rome]].

When Constantius died in 306, his son Constantine was crowned emperor on July 25 and subsequently accepted by Galerius into the [[tetrarchy]] as ''Caesar''. This set the precedent for Maxentius' accession later in the same year.

===Accession===
[[File:RomaBasilicaMassenzioDaPalatino.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The [[Basilica of Maxentius]] in the [[Roman Forum]]. Completed by his enemy Constantine, it was one of the most impressive edifices of ancient times.]]

When rumours reached the capital that the emperors tried to subject the Roman population to the capitation tax, like every other city of the empire, and wanted to dissolve the remains of the [[Praetorian Guard]] which were still stationed at Rome, riots broke out. A group of officers of the city's garrisons ([[Zosimus]] calls them Marcellianus, Marcellus and Lucianus) turned to Maxentius to accept the imperial purple, probably judging that the official recognition which was granted to Constantine would not be withheld from Maxentius, son of an emperor as well. Maxentius accepted the honour, promised donations to the city's troops, and was publicly acclaimed emperor on October 28, 306. The usurpation obviously went largely without bloodshed (Zosimus names only one victim); the prefect of Rome went over to Maxentius and retained his office. Apparently the conspirators turned to Maximian as well, who had retired to a palace in [[Lucania]], but he declined to resume power for the time being.

Maxentius managed to be recognized as emperor in central and southern Italy, the islands of [[Corsica et Sardinia|Corsica and Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], and the [[Roman Africa|Africa]]n provinces. Northern Italy remained under the control of the western Augustus [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]], who resided in [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]).

Maxentius refrained from using the titles Augustus or Caesar at first and styled himself ''princeps invictus'' (&quot;undefeated prince&quot;), in the hope of obtaining recognition of his reign by the senior emperor Galerius. However, the latter refused to do so. Apart from his alleged antipathy towards Maxentius, Galerius probably wanted to deter others from following the examples of Constantine and Maxentius and declaring themselves emperors. Constantine firmly controlled his father's army and territories, and Galerius could pretend that his accession was part of the regular succession in the [[tetrarchy]], but neither was the case with Maxentius: he would be the fifth emperor, and he had only few troops at his command. Galerius reckoned that it would be not too difficult to quell the usurpation, and early in 307, the Augustus Severus marched on Rome with a large army.

The majority of this army consisted of soldiers who had fought under Maxentius' father [[Maximian]] for years, and as Severus reached Rome, the majority of his army went over to Maxentius, rightful heir of their former commander, who dealt out a large amount of money. When Maximian himself finally left his retreat and returned to Rome to assume the imperial office once again and support his son, Severus with the rest of his army retreated to [[Ravenna]]. Shortly after he surrendered to Maximian, who promised that his life be spared.

After the defeat of Severus, Maxentius took possession of northern Italy up to the [[Alps]] and the [[Istria]]n peninsula to the east, and assumed the title of Augustus, which (in his eyes) had become vacant with the surrender of Severus.

===Emperor===
[[File:Follis-Maxentius-s3776.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Maxentius as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] on a ''[[follis]]''.]]

The joint rule of Maxentius and Maximian in Rome was tested further when Galerius himself marched to Italy in the summer of 307 with an even larger army. While negotiating with the invader, Maxentius could repeat what he did to Severus: by the promise of large sums of money, and the authority of Maximian, many soldiers of Galerius defected to him. Galerius was forced to withdraw, plundering Italy on his way. Some time during the invasion, Severus was put to death by Maxentius, probably at Tres Tabernae near Rome (the exact circumstances of his death are not certain). After the failed campaign of Galerius, Maxentius' reign over Italy and Africa was firmly established. Beginning in 307 already, he tried to arrange friendly contacts with Constantine, and in the summer of that year, Maximian traveled to [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], where Constantine married his daughter [[Fausta]] and was in turn appointed Augustus by the senior emperor. However, Constantine tried to avoid breaking with Galerius, and did not openly support Maxentius during the invasion.

In 308, probably April, Maximian tried to depose his son in an assembly of soldiers in Rome; surprisingly to him, the present troops remained faithful to his son, and he had to flee to Constantine. In the conference of [[Carnuntum]], in the autumn of that same year, Maxentius was once again denied recognition as legitimate emperor, and [[Licinius]] was appointed Augustus with the task of regaining the usurper's domain. Late in 308, [[Domitius Alexander]] was acclaimed emperor in [[Carthage]], and the African provinces seceded from Maxentian rule. This produced a dangerous situation for Maxentius, as  Africa was critical to [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|Rome's food supply]]. 

Maxentius' eldest son [[Valerius Romulus]] died in 309, at the age of about fourteen, was [[Apotheosis|deified]] and buried in a mausoleum in the [[Villa of Maxentius]] at the [[Via Appia]]. Nearby, Maxentius also constructed the [[Circus of Maxentius]]. After the death of Maximian in 309 or 310, relations with Constantine rapidly deteriorated, and Maxentius allied with [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] to counter an alliance between Constantine and Licinius. He allegedly tried to secure the province of [[Raetia]] north of the Alps, thereby dividing the realms of Constantine and Licinius (reported by Zosimus); the plan was not carried out, as Constantine acted first.

In 310, Maxentius lost [[Istria]] to Licinius, who could not continue the campaign, however, by the middle of 310 Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, 31–35; Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' 8.16. Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Jones, 66; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and he died soon after April 30, 311.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43–44; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius' death destabilized what remained of the Tetrarchic system.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing the news, Maximinus mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor before meeting Licinius on the Bosphorus to arrange terms for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Maxentius fortified northern Italy against potential invasions and sent a small army to Africa under the command of his [[praetorian prefect]] [[Gaius Caeionius Rufius Volusianus|Rufius Volusianus]] which defeated and executed the usurper Domitius Alexander in 310 or 311. Maxentius used the opportunity to seize the wealth of his supporters, and to bring large amounts of grain to Rome. He also strengthened his support among the Christians of Italy by allowing them to elect a new [[Bishop of Rome]], [[Pope Eusebius|Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maxentius was far from secure, however. His early support was dissolving into open protest;&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; by 312, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Without the revenues of the empire, Maxentius was forced to resume taxation in Italy to support his army and his building projects in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Odahl, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The election of a bishop did not aid much, either, as [[Persecution of Diocletian|Diocletian's persecution]] had split the Italian church into competing factions over the issue of [[apostasy]] (see [[Donatism]]). The Christians of Italy could easily see that Constantine was more sympathetic to their plight than Maxentius.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's &quot;murder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, in an attempt to prevent Maxentius from forming a hostile alliance with Licinius,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; forged his own alliance with the man over the winter of 311–12 by offering to him his sister [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] in marriage. Maximin considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for military support.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44–45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Two alliances, Maximin and Maxentius, Constantine and Licinius, lined up against one another.

{{Campaignbox Constantine Wars}}
{{See also|Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306-324 AD)}}
Maxentius expected an attack along his eastern flank from Licinius, and stationed an army in Verona.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine had smaller forces than his opponent: with his forces withdrawn from Africa, with the praetorian and Imperial Horse Guard, and with the troops he had taken from Severus, Maxentius had an army equal to approximately 100,000 soldiers to use against his opponents in the north.{{cn|date=September 2012}} Many of these he used to garrison fortified towns across the region, keeping most stationed with him in Verona. Against this, Constantine could only bring a force of between twenty-five and forty thousand men.{{cn|date=September 2012}} The bulk of his troops simply could not be withdrawn from the Rhine frontiers without negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; It was against the recommendations of his advisers and generals, against popular expectation, that Constantine anticipated Maxentius, and struck first.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

As early as weather permitted,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; late in the spring of 312,&lt;ref name=&quot;Odahl, 101&quot;&gt;Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine crossed the Alps with a quarter of his total army,{{cn|date=September 2012}} a force equivalent to something less than forty thousand men.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Having crossed the [[Cottian Alps]] at the [[Mont Cenis]] pass,&lt;ref name=&quot;Odahl, 101&quot;/&gt; he first came to Segusium ([[Susa (TO)|Susa]], [[Italy]]), a heavily fortified town containing a military garrison, which shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his forces to set its gates on fire and scale its walls, and took the town quickly. Constantine forbade the plunder of the town, and advanced into northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum ([[Turin]], Italy), Constantine encountered a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt; labeled ''[[clibanarii]]'' or ''[[cataphract]]i'' in the ancient sources. In the ensuing [[Battle of Turin (312)|battle]] Constantine spread his forces into a line, allowing Maxentius' cavalry to ride into the middle of his forces. As his forces broadly encircled the enemy cavalry, Constantine's own cavalry charged at the sides of the Maxentian cataphracts, beating them with iron-tipped clubs. Many Maxentian cavalrymen were dismounted, while most others were variously incapacitated by the blows. Constantine then commanded his foot soldiers to advance against the surviving Maxentian infantry, cutting them down as they fled.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9).5–6; 4(10).21–24; Odahl, 102, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory, the panegyrist who speaks of the events declares, came easily.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9).8.1; 4(10).25.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Turin refused to give refuge to the retreating forces of Maxentius. It opened its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain, recognizing Constantine's quick and clement victories, sent him embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. He resided there until the middle of the summer of 312 before moving on.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41–42; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raphael-Constantine at Milvian Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Battle of the Milvian Bridge (Giulio Romano)|The Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'' by [[Giulio Romano]]]]

It was expected that Maxentius would try the same strategy as against Severus and Galerius earlier; that is, remaining in the well-defended city of Rome, and sit out a siege which would cost his enemy much more. For somewhat uncertain reasons, he abandoned this plan, however, and offered battle to Constantine near the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge|Milvian Bridge]] on October 28, 312. Ancient sources usually attribute this action to superstition or (if pro-Constantinian) divine providence. Maxentius of course had consulted soothsayers before battle, as was customary practice, and it can be assumed that they reported favourable [[omen]]s, especially as the day of battle would be his ''dies imperii'', the day of his accession to the throne (which was October 28, 306). What else may have motivated him, is open to speculation.

The armies of Maxentius and Constantine met north of the city, some distance outside the walls, beyond the [[Tiber]] river on the [[Via Flaminia]]. Christian tradition, especially [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], claims that Constantine fought under the [[labarum]] in that battle, revealed to him in a dream. Of the battle itself, not much is known – Constantine's forces defeated Maxentius's troops, who retreated to the Tiber, and in the chaos of the fleeing army trying to cross the river, Maxentius fell into the water and drowned. His body was found the next day and paraded through the city, and later sent to Africa, as a sign that he had surely perished.

==Overview and legacy==

After Constantine's victory, Maxentius was systematically vilified and presented as a cruel, bloodthirsty and incompetent tyrant. While he was not counted under the persecutors of the Christians by early sources like [[Lactantius]], under the influence of the official propaganda later Christian tradition framed Maxentius as hostile to Christianity as well. This image has left its traces in all of our sources and has dominated the view of Maxentius well into the 20th century, when a more extensive use and analysis of non-literary sources like coins and inscriptions have led to a more balanced image. Maxentius was a prolific builder, whose achievements were overshadowed by Constantine's issue of a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' against him. Many buildings in Rome that are commonly associated with Constantine, such as the [[Basilica of Maxentius|great basilica]] in the [[forum Romanum]], were in fact built by Maxentius.&lt;ref&gt;Cullhed, M (1994) ''Conservator Urbis Suae'' Stockholm; Kerr, L (2001) ''A topography of death: the buildings of the emperor Maxentius on the Via Appia, Rome'' In M Carruthers et al (eds) ''Eleventh Annual Proceedings of the Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference'' pp.24–33 Oxford: Oxbow&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of Imperial insignia===
In December 2006, Italian archeologists announced that an excavation under a shrine near the [[Palatine Hill]] had unearthed several items in wooden boxes, which they identified as the imperial ''[[regalia]]'', possibly belonging to Maxentius.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/749781864&lt;/ref&gt; The items in these boxes, which were wrapped in linen and what appears to be silk, include 3 complete lances, 4 javelins, what appears to be a base for standards, and three glass and [[chalcedony]] spheres. The most important find was a scepter of a flower holding a blue-green globe, which is believed to have belonged to the Emperor himself because of its intricate workmanship, and has been dated to his rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=7022&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the only known imperial insignia so far recovered, which hitherto had only been known from representations on coins and in relief sculptures. Clementina Panella, the archaeologist who made the discovery states that &quot;These artifacts clearly belonged to the emperor, especially the scepter, which is very elaborated. It's not an item you would let someone else have.&quot; Panella notes that the insignia were likely hidden by Maxentius' supporters in an attempt to preserve the emperor's memory after he was defeated at the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]] by Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1303241.ece ''The Times'', online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The items have been restored and are on temporary display at the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]] at the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.

==In popular culture==
Maxentius is the main antagonist of the 1961 film ''[[Constantine and the Cross]]''. The character is played by [[Massimo Serato]].

In the 2014 film ''[[Katherine of Alexandria (film)|Katherine of Alexandria]]'', Maxentius was portrayed by [[Will Houston]].

'''Alexander''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|g|z|ˈ|æ|n|d|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|g|z|ˈ|ɑː|n|d|ər}}) is a common male first name, and less common [[Alexander (surname)|surname]] derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;Αλέξανδρος&quot; (Aléxandros). The most famous is [[Alexander the Great]], who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.

==Origin==
[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc-gre|Ἀλέξανδρος}} (Aléxandros), meaning &quot;Defender of the people&quot; or &quot;Defending men&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/candros|Ἀλέξανδρος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also, &quot;Protector of men&quot;, a compound of the verb {{lang|grc|ἀλέξειν}} ''alexein'', &quot;to ward off, to avert, to defend&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/cw|ἀλέξειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the noun {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}} ''anēr'', &quot;man&quot; (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}} ''andros'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nh/r|ἀνήρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing &quot;battle-prowess&quot;, in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy [[shield wall|battle line]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] feminine [[anthroponym]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀩𐀏𐀭𐀅𐀨}}, ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'' (transcribed as ''[[Alexandra]]''), written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;Tablet [[Mycenae|MY]] V 659 (61). {{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=217|title=The Linear B word a-re-ka-sa-da-ra|website=Palaeolexicon.

The name was one of the titles (&quot;epithets&quot;) given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to save warriors&quot;. In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*%29ale%2Fcandros Ἀλέξανδρος],
Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of [[Alexander the Great|King Alexander III, commonly known as &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;]]. Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

For most of his reign he was the colleague and rival of [[Constantine I]], with whom he co-authored the [[Edict of Milan]] that granted official toleration to Christians in the Roman Empire. He was finally defeated at the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]], before being executed on the orders of Constantine I.

==Early reign==

[[File:132 Licinius.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Licinius I.]]
Born to a [[Dacians|Dacian]]&lt;ref name=Jones509&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=A.H.M. |last2=Martindale |first2=J.R. |title=The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. I: AD260-395 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1971 |page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DiMaio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/licinius.htm |last=DiMaio |first=Michael, Jr. |title=Licinius (308–324 A.D.) |work=De Imperatoribus Romanis |date=February 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; peasant family in [[Moesia]] Superior, Licinius accompanied his close childhood friend, the future emperor [[Galerius]], on the Persian expedition in 298.&lt;ref name=Jones509 /&gt; He was trusted enough by Galerius that in 307 he was sent as an envoy to [[Maxentius]] in [[Italy]] to attempt to reach some agreement about the latter's illegitimate political position.&lt;ref name=Jones509 /&gt; Galerius then trusted the eastern provinces to Licinius when he went to deal with Maxentius personally after the death of [[Flavius Valerius Severus]].&lt;ref name=Gibbon&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=Vol. II |year=1776 |chapter=Chapter XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to the east Galerius elevated Licinius to the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus in the West]]  on November 11, 308. He received as his immediate command the provinces of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Thrace]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt; In 310 he took command of the war against the [[Sarmatians]], inflicting a severe defeat on them and emerging victorious.&lt;ref name=Lendering /&gt; On the death of Galerius in May 311, Licinius entered into an agreement with [[Maximinus II]] (Daia) to share the eastern provinces between them. By this point, not only was Licinius the official ''Augustus'' of the west but he also possessed part of the eastern provinces as well, as the [[Hellespont]] and the [[Bosporus]] became the dividing line, with Licinius taking the European provinces and Maximinus taking the Asian.&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt;

An alliance between Maximinus and Maxentius forced the two remaining emperors to enter into a formal agreement with each other.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; So in March 313 Licinius married [[Flavia Julia Constantia]], half-sister of [[Constantine I]],&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt; at Mediolanum (now [[Milan]]); they had a son, [[Licinius II|Licinius the Younger]], in 315. Their marriage was the occasion for the jointly-issued &quot;[[Edict of Milan]]&quot; that reissued Galerius' previous edict allowing [[Christianity]] to be professed in the Empire,&lt;ref name=DiMaio/&gt; with additional dispositions that restored confiscated properties to Christian congregations and exempted Christian clergy from municipal civic duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrié |first1=Jean-Michel |last2=Rousselle |first2=Aline |title=L'Empire Romain en mutation: des Sévères à Constantin, 192-337 |year=1999 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=Paris  |isbn=2-02-025819-6 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redaction of the edict as reproduced by [[Lactantius]] - who follows the text affixed by Licinius in [[Nicomedia]] on June 14 313, after Maximinus' defeat - uses a neutral language, expressing a will to propitiate &quot;any Divinity whatsoever in the seat of the heavens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mort. Pers''., ch. 48, cf. Internet History Sourcebooks Project, Fordham University, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp]. Accessed July 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Daia in the meantime decided to attack Licinius. Leaving Syria with 70,000 men, he reached [[Bithynia]], although harsh weather he encountered along the way had gravely weakened his army. In April 313, he crossed the [[Bosporus]] and went to [[Byzantium]], which was held by Licinius' troops. Undeterred, he took the town after an eleven-day siege. He moved to Heraclea, which he captured after a short siege, before moving his forces to the first posting station. With a much smaller body of men, possibly around 30,000,&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, George Childs, ''Dictionary Of Wars, Revised Edition'', pg 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Licinius arrived at [[Adrianople]] while Daia was still besieging [[Heraclea Sintica|Heraclea]]. Before the decisive engagement, Licinius allegedly had a vision in which an angel recited him a generic prayer that could be adopted by all cults and which Licinius then repeated to his soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain en Mutation'', 229&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 313, the two armies clashed at the [[Battle of Tzirallum]], and in the ensuing battle Daia's forces were crushed. Ridding himself of the imperial purple and dressing like a slave, Daia fled to [[Nicomedia]].&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; Believing he still had a chance to come out victorious, Daia attempted to stop the advance of Licinius at the [[Cilician Gates]] by establishing fortifications there. Unfortunately for Daia, Licinius' army succeeded in breaking through, forcing Daia to retreat to [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]] where Licinius continued to press him on land and sea. The war between them only ended with Daia’s death in August 313.&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt;

Given that Constantine had already crushed his rival Maxentius in 312, the two men decided to divide the Roman world between them. As a result of this settlement, Licinius became sole Augustus in the East, while his brother-in-law, Constantine, was supreme in the West. Licinius immediately rushed to the east to deal with another threat, this time from the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt;

==Conflict with Constantine I==
[[File:Licinius-Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|Sculptural portraits of Licinius (left) and his rival [[Constantine I]] (right).]]
In 314, a civil war erupted between Licinius and Constantine, in which Constantine used the pretext that Licinius was harbouring Senecio, whom Constantine accused of plotting to overthrow him.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt;  Constantine prevailed at the [[Battle of Cibalae]] in [[Pannonia]] (October 8, 314).&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt; Although the situation was temporarily settled, with both men sharing the [[consulship]] in 315, it was but a lull in the storm. The next year a new war erupted, when Licinius named [[Valerius Valens]] co-emperor,&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt; only for Licinius to suffer a humiliating defeat on the plain of [[battle of Mardia|Mardia]] (also known as [[Campus Ardiensis]]) in [[Thrace]]. The emperors were reconciled after these two battles and Licinius had his co-emperor Valens killed.&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt;

Over the next ten years, the two imperial colleagues maintained an uneasy truce.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; Licinius kept himself busy with a campaign against the Sarmatians in 318,&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt; but temperatures rose again in 321 when Constantine pursued some Sarmatians, who had been ravaging some territory in his realm, across the Danube into what was technically Licinius’s territory.&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt; When he repeated this with another invasion, this time by the [[Goths]] who were pillaging [[Thrace]], Licinius complained that Constantine had broken the treaty between them.

Constantine wasted no time going on the offensive. Licinius's fleet of 350 ships was defeated by Constantine's fleet in 323. Then in 324, Constantine, tempted by the &quot;advanced age and unpopular vices&quot;&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; of his colleague, again declared war against him and having defeated his army of 170,000 men{{dubious|date=April 2012}} at the [[battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] (July 3, 324), succeeded in shutting him up within the walls of [[Byzantium]].&lt;ref name=DiMaio /&gt; The defeat of the superior fleet of Licinius in the [[Battle of Hellespont|Battle of the Hellespont]] by [[Crispus]], Constantine’s eldest son and [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], compelled his withdrawal to [[Bithynia]], where a last stand was made; the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]], near [[Chalcedon]] (September 18), resulted in Licinius' final submission.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt;  While Licinius' co-emperor [[Sextus Martinianus]] was killed, Licinius himself was spared due to the pleas of his wife, Constantine's sister and interned at [[Thessalonica]].&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt; The next year, Constantine had him hanged, accusing him of conspiring to raise troops among the barbarians.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt;

==Character and legacy==
Constantine made every effort to blacken the reputation of his imperial colleague. To this end, stories began circulating about Licinius’s cruelty. It was said that he had put to death [[Flavius Severianus]], the son of the emperor Severus, as well as Candidianus, the son of Galerius.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; To this was added the execution of the wife and daughter of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], who had fled from the court of Licinius before being discovered at [[Thessalonica]].&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt; Much of this can be considered imperial propaganda on the part of Constantine.

In addition, as part of Constantine’s attempts to decrease Licinius’s popularity, he actively portrayed his brother-in-law as a pagan supporter. This was not the case; contemporary evidence tends to suggest that he was at least a committed supporter of Christians.&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt; He co-authored the Edict of Milan which ended the [[Great Persecution]], and re-affirmed the rights of Christians in his half of the empire. He also added the Christian symbol to his armies, and attempted to regulate the affairs of the Church hierarchy just as Constantine and his successors were to do. His wife was a devout Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Leithart]], ''[[Defending Constantine|Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom]]''. Intervarsity Press , Downers Grove, IL: 2010, ISBN 978-0-8308-2722-0 , page 101&lt;/ref&gt; It is even a possibility that he converted.&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt; However, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], writing under the rule of Constantine, charges him with expelling Christians from the Palace and ordering military sacrifice, as well as interfering with the Church's internal procedures and organization.&lt;ref&gt;James Richard Gearey, &quot;The Persecution of Licinius&quot;.

Accessed July 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eusebius, this turned what appeared to be a committed Christian into a man who feigned sympathy for the sect but who eventually exposed his true bloodthirsty pagan nature, only to be stopped by the virtuous Constantine.&lt;ref name=Canduci /&gt;

Finally, on Licinius’s death, his memory was branded with infamy; his statues were thrown down; and by edict, all his laws and judicial proceedings during his reign were abolished.&lt;ref name=Gibbon /&gt;

'''Constantine the Great''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Constantine's official imperial title was IMPERATOR CAESAR FLAVIVS CONSTANTINVS PIVS FELIX INVICTVS AVGVSTVS, ''Imperator Caesar Flavius Constantine Augustus, the pious, the fortunate, the undefeated''. After 312, he added MAXIMVS (&quot;the greatest&quot;), and after 325 replaced (&quot;undefeated&quot;) with VICTOR, as ''invictus'' reminded many of [[Sol Invictus]], the Sun God.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Κωνσταντῖνος ὁ Μέγας; 27 February {{circa}} 272&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;ref name=birthdate&gt;Birth dates vary but most modern historians use {{c.}} 272&quot;. Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; – 22 May 337&amp;nbsp;AD), also known as '''Constantine I''' or '''Saint Constantine''' (in the [[Orthodox Church]] as '''Saint Constantine the Great, [[Equal-to-the-Apostles]]'''),&lt;ref&gt;Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] Christians. The [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] liturgical calendar, observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine rite]], lists both Constantine and his mother [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]] as saints. Although he is not included in the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Church's]] list of saints, which does recognise several other Constantines as saints, he is revered under the title &quot;The Great&quot; for his contributions to [[Christianity]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman Emperor]] from 306 to 337&amp;nbsp;AD. Constantine was the son of [[Flavius Valerius Constantius]], a Roman army officer, and his consort [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]]. His father became ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', the deputy emperor in the west in 293&amp;nbsp;AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]]. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britannia]] (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at [[Eboracum]] (Modern-day [[York]]) after his father's death in 306&amp;nbsp;AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors [[Maxentius]] and [[Licinius]] to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324&amp;nbsp;AD.

As emperor, Constantine enacted many administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire. The [[Praetorian prefecture|government was restructured]] and [[Praetorian prefect|civil]] and [[Magister militum|military]] authority separated. A new gold coin, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]], was introduced to combat inflation. It would become the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The first Roman emperor to [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|claim conversion]] to [[Christianity]],{{refn|with the possible exception of [[Philip the Arab]] (r. 244–249). See [[Philip the Arab and Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'' (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1984), 65–93; H. A. Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, ''Historia'' 29:4 (1980): 463–73.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Constantine played an influential role in the proclamation of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, which decreed tolerance for Christianity in the empire. He called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, at which the [[Nicene Creed]] was professed by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of [[comitatenses|mobile field units]] and [[limitanei|garrison soldiers]] capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the [[Franks]], the [[Alamanni]], the [[Goths]], and the [[Sarmatians]]—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the [[Crisis of the Third Century|turmoil of the previous century]].

The age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He built a new imperial residence at [[Byzantium]] and renamed the city [[Constantinople]] after himself (the laudatory epithet of &quot;New Rome&quot; came later, and was never an official title). It would later become the capital of the Empire for over one thousand years; for which reason the later Eastern Empire would come to be known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. His more immediate political legacy was that, in leaving the empire to his sons, he replaced Diocletian's [[tetrarchy]] with the principle of dynastic succession. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and centuries after his reign. The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, ''Remembering Constantine at the Milvian Bridge'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with [[the Renaissance]], there were more critical appraisals of his reign due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources. Critics portrayed him as a tyrant. Trends in modern and recent scholarship attempted to balance the extremes of previous scholarship.

Constantine—as possibly the first Christian emperor (although that title could possibly go to [[Philip the Arab]])—is a significant figure in the [[history of Christianity]]. The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], built on his orders at the purported site of [[Jesus]]' tomb in [[Jerusalem]], became the holiest place in [[Christendom]]. The [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal claim to temporal power]] was based on the supposed [[Donation of Constantine]]. He is venerated as a [[saint]] by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholics]], and [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]].

==Sources==
Constantine was a ruler of major historical importance, and he has always been a controversial figure.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 14; Cameron, 90–91; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 23–25; Cameron, 90–91; Southern, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and are often one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 90; Southern, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life and rule.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 14; Corcoran, ''Empire of the Tetrarchs'', 1; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest replacement is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Vita Constantini'', a work that is a mixture of [[eulogy]] and [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 265–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Written between 335&amp;nbsp;AD and circa 339&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;What Eusebius Knew,&quot; 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Vita'' extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.11; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vita'' creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine,&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 5; Storch, 145–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 265–71; Cameron, 90–92; Cameron and Hall, 4–6; Elliott, &quot;Eusebian Frauds in the &quot;Vita Constantini&quot;&quot;, 162–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous ''Origo Constantini''.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 39; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A work of uncertain date,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 26; Lieu and Montserrat, 40; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Origo'' focuses on military and political events, to the    neglect of cultural and religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 40; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', a political Christian pamphlet on the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and the [[Tetrarchy]], provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 12–14; Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 24; Mackay, 207; Odahl, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ecclesiastical]] histories of [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], [[Sozomen]], and [[Theodoret]] describe the [[ecclesiastic]] disputes of Constantine's later reign.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 225; Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 28–29; Odahl, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Written during the reign of [[Theodosius II]] (408–50&amp;nbsp;AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 225; Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 26–29; Odahl, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian [[Athanasius]] and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian [[Philostorgius]] also survive, though their biases are no less firm.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 6, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[epitome]]s of [[Aurelius Victor]] (''De Caesaribus''), [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] (''Breviarium''), [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] (''Breviarium''), and the anonymous author of the ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 27–28; Lieu and Montserrat, 2–6; Odahl, 6–7; Warmington, 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'', a collection of [[panegyric]]s from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 24; Odahl, 8; Wienand, ''Kaiser als Sieger'', 26–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architecture, such as the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome and palaces in [[Gamzigrad]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]],&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 20–21; Johnson, &quot;Architecture of Empire&quot; (CC), 288–91; Odahl, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] remains, and the [[coin]]age of the era complement the literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 17–21; Odahl, 11–14; Wienand, ''Kaiser als Sieger'', 43–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Medijana.jpg|thumb|Remains of the luxurious residence palace of [[Mediana]], erected by Constantine I near his birth town of [[Naissus]]]]
Flavius Valerius Constantinus, as he was originally named, was born in the city of Naissus, (today [[Niš]], [[Serbia]]) part of the [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] province of [[Moesia]] on 27 February,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 39–42; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Odahl, 15; Pohlsander, &quot;Constantine I&quot;; Southern, 169, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; probably {{c.}} 272&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–42; Elliott, &quot;Constantine's Conversion,&quot; 425–6; Elliott, &quot;Eusebian Frauds,&quot; 163; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Jones, 13–14; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14; Rodgers, 238; Wright, 495, 507.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], a native of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] province of Moesia (later [[Dacia ripensis|Dacia Ripensis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CTCR&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal account written in 362 A.D. [[Julian (emperor)|Emperor Julian]], [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]]' grandson and Constantine's nephew, was considering himself the offspring of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attalus.org/translate/misopogon.html |title=''Misopogon (Beard-hater)'', translation by Wright, W.C. (1913) |publisher=Attalus.org |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine probably spent little time with his father &lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; who was an officer in the Roman army, part of the Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s imperial bodyguard. Being described as a tolerant and politically skilled man, &lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5), 9(4); Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 8.7; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.13.3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius advanced through the ranks, earning the [[Roman governor|governorship]] of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] from Emperor [[Diocletian]], another of Aurelian's companions from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], in 284 or 285.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTCR&quot;/&gt; Constantine's mother was [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], possibly a  [[Bithynia]]n woman of low social standing.&lt;ref&gt;Drijvers, J.W. ''Helena Augusta: The Mother of Constantine the Great and the Legend of Her finding the True Cross'' (Leiden, 1991) 9, 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain whether she was legally married to Constantius or merely his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59, 83; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if Constantine could speak [[Thracian language|Thracian]], his main language being Latin, during his public speeches he needed Greek translators.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tejirian|first1=Eleanor H.|last2=Simon|first2=Reeva Spector|title=Conflict, conquest, and conversion two thousand years of Christian missions in the Middle East|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231511094|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHwMD0-X7aYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantian Dynasty, the children of Constantius.png|thumb|left|Constantine's parents and siblings, the dates in square brackets indicate the possession of minor titles]]
In July 285&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian declared [[Maximian]], another colleague from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], his co-emperor. Each emperor would have his own court, his own military and administrative faculties, and each would rule with a separate [[praetorian prefect]] as chief lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–14; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 41–54; Odahl, 46–50; Treadgold, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian ruled in the West, from his capitals at [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]) or Augusta Treverorum ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]), while Diocletian ruled in the East, from [[Nicomedia]] ([[İzmit]], [[Turkey]]). The division was merely pragmatic: the Empire was called &quot;indivisible&quot; in official panegyric,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 70; Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and both emperors could move freely throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 288, Maximian appointed Constantius to serve as his praetorian prefect in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Constantius left Helena to marry Maximian's stepdaughter [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]] in 288 or 289.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 47, 299; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian divided the Empire again in 293&amp;nbsp;AD, appointing two [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate to their respective [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the [[Tetrarchy]]. Diocletian's first appointee for the office of Caesar was Constantius; his second was [[Galerius]], a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels [[Carausius]] and [[Allectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 8; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 40–41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Odahl, 46–47; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 8–9, 14; Treadgold, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 42–43, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the East===

Constantine received a formal education at Diocletian's court, where he learned Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 73–74; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 72, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47, 73–74; Fowden, &quot;Between Pagans and Christians,&quot; 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held as something of a hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of [[tribune|tribunates]]; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296&amp;nbsp;AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297&amp;nbsp;AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'', 16.2; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine''., 29–30; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 305&amp;nbsp;AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a ''tribunus ordinis primi''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; Odahl, 72–74, 306; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15. Contra: J. Moreau, ''Lactance: &quot;De la mort des persécuteurs&quot;'', ''Sources Chrétiennes'' 39 (1954): 313; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine had returned to Nicomedia from the eastern front by the spring of 303&amp;nbsp;AD, in time to witness the beginnings of Diocletian's &quot;[[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]]&quot;, the most severe [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 30; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 302, Diocletian and Galerius sent a messenger to the [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]] with an inquiry about Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.6–11; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 35–36; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24; Odahl, 67; Potter, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine could recall his presence at the palace when the messenger returned, when Diocletian accepted his court's demands for universal persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 2.49–52; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Odahl, 67, 73, 304; Potter, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 303&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian ordered the destruction of Nicomedia's new church, condemned its scriptures to the flames, and had its treasures seized. In the months that followed, churches and scriptures were destroyed, Christians were deprived of official ranks, and priests were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22–25; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–30; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that Constantine played any role in the persecution.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later writings he would attempt to present himself as an opponent of Diocletian's &quot;sanguinary edicts&quot; against the &quot;worshippers of God&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing indicates that he opposed it effectively at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;The Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 126; Elliott, &quot;Constantine's Conversion,&quot; 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no contemporary Christian challenged Constantine for his inaction during the persecutions, it remained a political liability throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;The Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 305&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian, as a result of a debilitating sickness taken in the winter of 304–305&amp;nbsp;AD, announced his resignation. In a parallel ceremony in Milan, Maximian did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 69–72; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15; Potter, 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Lactantius states that Galerius manipulated the weakened Diocletian into resigning, and forced him to accept Galerius' allies in the imperial succession. According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until the very last moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and [[Maxentius]] (Maximian's son) as his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2–6; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not to be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus Daia]], Galerius' nephew, were appointed their Caesars respectively. Constantine and Maxentius were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60–61; Odahl, 72–74; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ancient sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months following Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle [[Danube]], made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet.&lt;ref&gt;''Origo'' 4; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.3–9; Praxagoras fr. 1.2; Aurelius Victor 40.2–3; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 41.2; Zosimus 2.8.3; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.21; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West===
Constantine recognized the implicit danger in remaining at Galerius's court, where he was held as a virtual hostage. His career depended on being rescued by his father in the west. Constantius was quick to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late spring or early summer of 305&amp;nbsp;AD, Constantius requested leave for his son to help him campaign in Britain. After a long evening of drinking, Galerius granted the request. Constantine's later propaganda describes how he fled the court in the night, before Galerius could change his mind. He rode from  [[Cursus publicus|post-house]] to post-house at high speed, [[hamstringing]] every horse in his wake.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39–40; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 77; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16; Potter, 344–5; Southern, 169–70, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Galerius awoke the following morning, Constantine had fled too far to be caught.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine joined his father in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], at Bononia ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]) before the summer of 305&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39–40; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; Odahl, 77; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16; Potter, 344–45; Southern, 169–70, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantine, York Minster.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze statue of Constantine I in [[York]], [[England]], near the spot where he was proclaimed Augustus in 306]]
From Bononia they crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] to Britain and made their way to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), capital of the province of [[Britannia Secunda]] and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the [[Picts]] beyond [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the summer and autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27, 298; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 77–78, 309; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius's campaign, like that of [[Septimius Severus]] before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, 233–34; Southern, 170, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius had become severely sick over the course of his reign, and died on 25 July 306 in [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The [[Alamanni]]c king [[Chrocus]], a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule;&lt;ref name=&quot;N35&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27–28; Jones, 59; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61–62; Odahl, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Iberia, which had been in his father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bust of Constantine I from York YORYM 1998 23.jpg|thumb|right|Marble bust of Constantine the Great from Stonegate, [[York, North Yorkshire|York]]]]
Constantine sent Galerius an official notice of Constantius's death and his own acclamation. Along with the notice, he included a portrait of himself in the robes of an Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28–29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait was wreathed in [[Bay Laurel|bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 59; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He requested recognition as heir to his father's throne, and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had &quot;forced it upon him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius was put into a fury by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire. His advisers calmed him, and argued that outright denial of Constantine's claims would mean certain war.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28–29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80; Rees, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius was compelled to compromise: he granted Constantine the title &quot;Caesar&quot; rather than &quot;Augustus&quot; (the latter office went to Severus instead).&lt;ref name=&quot;GCA&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41; Jones, 59; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to make it clear that he alone gave Constantine legitimacy, Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor's traditional [[Tyrian purple|purple robes]].&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine accepted the decision,&lt;ref name=&quot;GCA&quot;/&gt; knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's own language was Latin and his speeches had to be translated in Greek when it was needed.&lt;ref name=columbia /&gt;

==Early rule==
[[File:Constantinus.JPG|thumb|The portrait of Gaius Flavius Valerius Constantinus on a Roman coin. The inscription around the portrait is &quot;Constantinus Aug[ustus]&quot;.]]
Constantine's share of the Empire consisted of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded one of the largest Roman armies, stationed along the important [[Rhine]] frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, driving back the tribes of the Picts and secured his control in the northwestern [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon left for [[History of Trier#Roman Empire|Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franks]], after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–307&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers were fed to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' (arrival) celebrations that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 63; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39–40; Odahl, 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trier Kaiserthermen BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Public bathing|Public baths]] (''[[thermae]]'') built in [[Trier]] by Constantine. More than {{convert|100|m|0}} wide by {{convert|200|m|0}} long, and capable of serving several thousands at a time, the baths were built to rival those of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Constantine began a major expansion of Trier. He strengthened the circuit wall around the city with military towers and fortified gates, and began building a palace complex in the northeastern part of the city. To the south of his palace, he ordered the construction of a large formal audience hall, and a massive imperial bathhouse. Constantine sponsored many building projects across Gaul during his tenure as emperor of the West, especially in Augustodunum ([[Autun]]) and Arelate ([[Arles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 82–83. See also: William E. Gwatkin, Jr. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CJ/29/1/Roman_Trier*.html Roman Trier].&quot; ''The Classical Journal'' 29 (1933): 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lactantius, Constantine followed his father in following a tolerant policy towards Christianity. Although not yet a Christian, he probably judged it a more sensible policy than open persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.9; Barnes, &quot;Lactantius and Constantine&quot;, 43–46; Odahl, 85, 310–11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a way to distinguish himself from the &quot;great persecutor&quot;, Galerius.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine decreed a formal end to persecution, and returned to Christians all they had lost during the persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Constantine was still largely untried and had a hint of illegitimacy about him, he relied on his father's reputation in his early propaganda: the earliest panegyrics to Constantine give as much coverage to his father's deeds as to those of Constantine himself.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's military skill and building projects soon gave the panegyrist the opportunity to comment favorably on the similarities between father and son, and Eusebius remarked that Constantine was a &quot;renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father's life and reign&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)3.4; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.22, qtd. and tr. Odahl, 83; Rodgers, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinian coinage, sculpture and oratory also shows a new tendency for disdain towards the &quot;barbarians&quot; beyond the frontiers. After Constantine's victory over the Alemanni, he minted a coin issue depicting weeping and begging Alemannic tribesmen—&quot;The Alemanni conquered&quot;—beneath the phrase &quot;Romans' rejoicing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little sympathy for these enemies. As his panegyrist declared: &quot;It is a stupid clemency that spares the conquered foe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxentius' rebellion===
[[File:Maxentius02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|Dresden bust of Maxentius]]
Following Galerius' recognition of Constantine as caesar, Constantine's portrait was brought to Rome, as was customary. [[Maxentius]] mocked the portrait's subject as the son of a harlot, and lamented his own powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2.9.2; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius, envious of Constantine's authority,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Odahl, 86; Potter, 346.&lt;/ref&gt; seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306&amp;nbsp;AD. Galerius refused to recognize him, but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30–31; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41–42; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87; Potter, 348–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307&amp;nbsp;AD. He offered to marry his daughter [[Fausta]] to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307&amp;nbsp;AD. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 64; Odahl, 87–88; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine remained aloof from the Italian conflict, however. Over the spring and summer of 307&amp;nbsp;AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308&amp;nbsp;AD, he raided the territory of the [[Bructeri]], and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium ([[Cologne]]). In 310&amp;nbsp;AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 63–65; Odahl, 89; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308&amp;nbsp;AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308&amp;nbsp;AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 64; Odahl, 89, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 308&amp;nbsp;AD, Galerius called a general council at the military city of [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]) to resolve the instability in the western provinces. In attendance were Diocletian, briefly returned from retirement, Galerius, and Maximian. Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar. [[Licinius]], one of Galerius' old military companions, was appointed Augustus in the western regions. The new system did not last long: Constantine refused to accept the demotion, and continued to style himself as Augustus on his coinage, even as other members of the Tetrarchy referred to him as a Caesar on theirs. [[Maximinus Daia]] was frustrated that he had been passed over for promotion while the newcomer Licinius had been raised to the office of Augustus, and demanded that Galerius promote him. Galerius offered to call both Maximinus and Constantine &quot;sons of the Augusti&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32–34; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 42–43; Jones, 61; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 65; Odahl, 90–91; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349–50; Treadgold, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but neither accepted the new title. By the spring of 310&amp;nbsp;AD, Galerius was referring to both men as Augusti.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 33; Jones, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Maximian's rebellion===
[[File:Constantine multiple CdM Beistegui 233.jpg|right|thumb|A gold multiple of &quot;Unconquered Constantine&quot; with [[Sol Invictus]], struck in 313&amp;nbsp;AD. The use of Sol's image appealed to both the educated citizens of Gaul, who would recognize in it Apollo's patronage of [[Augustus]] and the arts; and to Christians, who found solar monotheism less objectionable than the traditional pagan pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 310&amp;nbsp;AD, a dispossessed  Maximian rebelled against Constantine while Constantine was away campaigning against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with a contingent of Constantine's army, in preparation for any attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. He announced that Constantine was dead, and took up the imperial purple. In spite of a large donative pledge to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal to their emperor, and Maximian was soon compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and marched his army up the Rhine.&lt;ref name = &quot;yuhknp&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34–35; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 65–66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; At Cabillunum ([[Chalon-sur-Saône]]), he moved his troops onto waiting boats to row down the slow waters of the [[Saône]] to the quicker waters of the [[Rhone]]. He disembarked at [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian fled to Massilia ([[Marseille]]), a town better able to withstand a long siege than Arles. It made little difference, however, as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured and reproved for his crimes. Constantine granted some clemency, but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310&amp;nbsp;AD, Maximian hanged himself.&lt;ref name = &quot;yuhknp&quot;/&gt;

In spite of the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311&amp;nbsp;AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40–41, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Maximian required a shift in Constantine's public image. He could no longer rely on his connection to the elder emperor Maximian, and needed a new source of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered in Gaul on 25 July 310&amp;nbsp;AD, the anonymous orator reveals a previously unknown dynastic connection to [[Claudius II]], a 3rd Century emperor famed for defeating the Goths and restoring order to the empire. Breaking away from tetrarchic models, the speech emphasizes Constantine's ancestral prerogative to rule, rather than principles of imperial equality. The new ideology expressed in the speech made Galerius and Maximian irrelevant to Constantine's right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7); Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 35–37, 301; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 66; Odahl, 94–95, 314–15; Potter, 352–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the orator emphasizes ancestry to the exclusion of all other factors: &quot;No chance agreement of men, nor some unexpected consequence of favor, made you emperor,&quot; the orator declares to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7)1. Qtd. in Potter, 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oration also moves away from the religious ideology of the Tetrarchy, with its focus on twin dynasties of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Hercules]]. Instead, the orator proclaims that Constantine experienced a divine vision of [[Apollo]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] granting him [[laurel wreath]]s of health and a long reign. In the likeness of Apollo Constantine recognized himself as the saving figure to whom would be granted &quot;rule of the whole world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7).21.5.&lt;/ref&gt; as the poet Virgil had once foretold.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''[[Bucolics|Ecologues]]'' 4.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The oration's religious shift is paralleled by a similar shift in Constantine's coinage. In his early reign, the coinage of Constantine advertised [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] as his patron. From 310&amp;nbsp;AD on, Mars was replaced by [[Sol Invictus]], a god conventionally identified with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 67; Odahl, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little reason to believe that either the dynastic connection or the divine vision are anything other than fiction, but their proclamation strengthened Constantine's claims to legitimacy and increased his popularity among the citizens of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 50–53; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 66–67; Odahl, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Maxentius===
{{Campaignbox Constantine Wars}}

By the middle of 310&amp;nbsp;AD, Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 31–35; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.16; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; His final act survives: a letter to the provincials posted in Nicomedia on 30 April 311&amp;nbsp;AD, proclaiming an end to the persecutions, and the resumption of religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.17; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 304; Jones, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He died soon after the edict's proclamation,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43–44; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; destroying what little remained of the tetrarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximinus mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor. A hasty peace was signed on a boat in the middle of the Bosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; While Constantine toured Britain and Gaul, Maxentius prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; He fortified northern Italy, and strengthened his support in the Christian community by allowing it to elect a new [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], [[Pope Eusebius|Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxentius' rule was nevertheless insecure. His early support dissolved in the wake of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and [[Carthage]];&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37; Curran, 66; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domitius Alexander]] was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa.&lt;ref name = &quot;leohak&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By 312&amp;nbsp;AD, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; even among Christian Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38–39; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 311&amp;nbsp;AD, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's &quot;murder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40; Curran, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–312&amp;nbsp;AD, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximin considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44–45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was &quot;not a place where people were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.15.1–2, qtd. and tr. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's advisers and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; even his soothsayers recommended against it, stating that the sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)2.5; Curran, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some to believe that he had some form of supernatural guidance,&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ignored all these cautions.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the spring of 312&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref name = &quot;esyyqc&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine crossed the [[Cottian Alps]] with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5.1–3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The first town his army encountered was Segusium ([[Susa (TO)|Susa]], [[Italy]]), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.&lt;ref name = &quot;esyyqc&quot;/&gt;

At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum ([[Turin]], Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Battle of Turin (312)|battle]] Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5–6; 4(10)21–24; Jones, 70–71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 102, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 71; Odahl, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312&amp;nbsp;AD, when he moved on to Brixia ([[Brescia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41–42; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brescia's army was easily dispersed,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantine quickly advanced to [[Verona]], where a large Maxentian force was camped.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruricius Pompeianus, general of the Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the [[Adige]]. Constantine sent a small force north of the town in an attempt to cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruricius gave Constantine the slip and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought [[Battle of Verona (312)|encounter]] that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by [[Aquileia]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutina ([[Modena]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Curran, 67; Jones, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ponte Milvio-side view-antmoose.jpg|thumb|right|The Milvian Bridge ([[Ponte Milvio]]) over the Tiber, north of Rome, where Constantine and Maxentius fought in the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]]]
Maxentius prepared for the same type of war he had waged against Severus and Galerius: he sat in Rome and prepared for a siege.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He still controlled Rome's praetorian guards, was well-stocked with African grain, and was surrounded on all sides by the seemingly impregnable [[Aurelian Walls]]. He ordered all bridges across the [[Tiber]] cut, reportedly on the counsel of the gods,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and left the rest of central Italy undefended; Constantine secured that region's support without challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine progressed slowly&lt;ref name=&quot;BC42&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; along the ''[[Via Flaminia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 72; Odahl, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the weakness of Maxentius to draw his regime further into turmoil.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC42&quot; /&gt; Maxentius' support continued to weaken: at chariot races on 27 October, the crowd openly taunted Maxentius, shouting that Constantine was invincible.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Curran, 67; Jones, 71–72; Odahl, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius, no longer certain that he would emerge from a siege victorious, built a temporary boat bridge across the Tiber in preparation for a field battle against Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42–43; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 312&amp;nbsp;AD, the sixth anniversary of his reign, he approached the keepers of the [[Sibylline Books]] for guidance. The keepers prophesied that, on that very day, &quot;the enemy of the Romans&quot; would die.

Maxentius organized his forces—still twice the size of Constantine's—in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river.&lt;ref name = &quot;bvubfs&quot;&gt;Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Digeser, 122; Jones, 72; Odahl, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised &quot;to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers&amp;nbsp;... by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 44.4–6, tr. J.L. Creed, ''Lactantius: De Mortibus Persecutorum'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), qtd. in Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, &quot;he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, ''In Hoc Signo Vinces'' or &quot;with this sign, you will conquer&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.28, tr. Odahl, 105. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 113; Odahl, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the ''[[labarum]]'', for his army in that form.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.27–29; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43, 306; Odahl, 105–6, 319–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place,&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron and Hall, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius describes the sign as [[Chi (letter)|Chi]] (Χ) traversed by [[Rho (letter)|Rho]] (Ρ): ☧, a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word ''Christos'' or Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 306; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 73; Odahl, 319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cameron and Hall, 206–7; Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 114; Nicholson, 311.&lt;/ref&gt; In 315&amp;nbsp;AD a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the ''[[Chi Rho]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71, citing ''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 7 Ticinum 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and coins issued at Siscia in 317/318&amp;nbsp;AD repeat the image.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ross Holloway, ''Constantine and Rome'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 3, citing Kraft, &quot;Das Silbermedaillon Constantins des Grosses mit dem Christusmonogram auf dem Helm,&quot; ''Jahrbuch für Numismatik und Geldgeschichte'' 5–6 (1954/55): 151–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine deployed his own forces along the whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber where they were slaughtered and drowned.&lt;ref name = &quot;bvubfs&quot;/&gt; The battle was brief:&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Curran, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under the force of a Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Curran, 68; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine entered Rome on 29 October 312.{{sfn|Barnes|1981|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LGDjJK-JeSwC&amp;pg=PA44 p.&amp;nbsp;44]}}&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He staged a grand ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' in the city, and was met with popular jubilation.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 93; Curran, 71–74; Odahl, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44; Curran, 72; Jones, 72; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceremonies, Maxentius' disembodied head was sent to [[Carthage]]; at this, Carthage would offer no further resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his predecessors, Constantine neglected to make the trip to the [[Capitoline Hill]] and perform customary sacrifices at the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 111. Cf. also Curran, 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, choose to honor the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial]] [[Curia Julia|Curia]] with a visit,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45; Curran, 72; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges and give it a secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius' supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45–46; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Senate decreed him &quot;title of the first name&quot;, which meant his name would be listed first in all official documents,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 46; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and acclaimed him as &quot;the greatest Augustus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He issued decrees returning property lost under Maxentius, recalling political exiles, and releasing Maxentius' imprisoned opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive propaganda campaign followed, during which Maxentius' image was systematically purged from all public places. Maxentius was written up as a &quot;[[tyrant]]&quot;, and set against an idealized image of the &quot;liberator&quot;, Constantine. Eusebius, in his later works, is the best representative of this strand of Constantinian propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45–47; Cameron, 93; Curran, 76–77; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' rescripts were declared invalid, and the honors Maxentius had granted to leaders of the Senate were invalidated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, CE, 45&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine also attempted to remove Maxentius' influence on Rome's urban landscape. All structures built by Maxentius were re-dedicated to Constantine, including the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano#History|Temple of Romulus]] and the [[Basilica of Maxentius]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; At the focal point of the basilica, a stone statue of Constantine holding the Christian ''labarum'' in its hand was erected. Its inscription bore the message the statue had already made clear: By this sign Constantine had freed Rome from the yoke of the tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where he did not overwrite Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the [[Circus Maximus]] was redeveloped so that its total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the [[Via Appia]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the [[Praetorian Guard]] and Imperial Horse Guard (''[[equites singulares]]'') were disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45; Curran, 76; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Their{{clarify|Whose tombstones? This probably got separated during some prior edit|date=March 2013}} tombstones were ground up and put to use in a basilica on the [[Via Labicana]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 312&amp;nbsp;AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;Krautheimer, ''Corpus Basilicarum Christianarum Romanorum'', 5.90, cited in Curran, 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legio II Parthica]] was removed from Alba ([[Albano Laziale]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, CE, 45&quot;/&gt; and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars against Licinius===
In the following years, Constantine gradually consolidated his military superiority over his rivals in the crumbling Tetrarchy. In 313, he met [[Licinius]] in [[Milan]] to secure their alliance by the marriage of Licinius and Constantine's half-sister [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]]. During this meeting, the emperors agreed on the so-called [[Edict of Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;The term is a misnomer as the act of Milan was not an edict, while the subsequent edicts by Licinius—of which the edicts to the provinces of Bythinia and Palestine are recorded by Lactantius and Eusebius, respectively—were not issued in Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;
officially granting full tolerance to Christianity and all religions in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
The document had special benefits for Christians, legalizing their religion and granting them restoration for all property seized during Diocletian's persecution. It repudiates past methods of religious coercion and used only general terms to refer to the divine sphere—&quot;Divinity&quot; and &quot;Supreme Divinity&quot;, ''summa divinitas''.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;Impact,&quot; 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference was cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximin had crossed the [[Bosporus]] and invaded European territory. Licinius departed and eventually defeated Maximin, gaining control over the entire eastern half of the Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt at the hands of a character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229&lt;/ref&gt; Licinius, for his part had Constantine's statues in Emona destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Byfield, Ted, ed. The Christians: Their First Two Thousand Years, vol. III By This Sign. pg 148. [http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-constantine-era/constantine]&lt;/ref&gt;
In either 314 or 316 the two Augusti fought against one another at the [[Battle of Cibalae]], with Constantine being victorious. They clashed again at the [[Battle of Mardia]] in 317, and agreed to a settlement in which Constantine's sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], and Licinius' son Licinianus were made ''[[Caesar (title)|caesars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
After this arrangement, Constantine ruled the dioceses of Pannonia and Macedonia and took residence at [[Sirmium]], from whence he could wage war on the Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the year 320, [[Licinius]] allegedly reneged on the religious freedom promised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and began to oppress Christians anew,&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
generally without bloodshed, but resorting to confiscations and sacking of Christian office-holders.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229/230&lt;/ref&gt; Although this characterization of Licinius as anti-Christian is somewhat doubtful, the fact is that he seems to have been far less open in his support of Christianity than Constantine. Therefore, Licinius was prone to see the Church as a force more loyal to Constantine than to the Imperial system in general &lt;ref&gt;Timothy E. Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium''. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, ISBN 978-1-4051-8471-7, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; – the explanation offered by the Church historian [[Sozomen]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Schaff, ed., ''Nicene and Post-nicene Fathers: Second Series''. New York: Cosimo, 2007, ISBN 978-1-60206-508-6, page 418, footnote 6&lt;/ref&gt;

This dubious arrangement eventually became a challenge to Constantine in the West, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by [[Goths|Goth]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], represented the past and the ancient [[Paganism|Pagan]] faiths. Constantine and his [[Franks]] marched under the standard of the ''[[labarum]]'', and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]]. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed [[Martinianus|Martius Martinianus]], the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the [[Battle of the Hellespont]], and finally the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] on 18 September 324.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Licinius and Martinianus surrendered to Constantine at Nicomedia on the promise their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, ''Chronicle of the Roman Emperors'', 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;macmullen&quot;&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of Constantinople===
[[File:Constantinopolis coin.jpg|right|thumb|Coin struck by Constantine I to commemorate the founding of Constantinople]]
Licinius' defeat came to represent the defeat of a rival center of Pagan and Greek-speaking political activity in the East, as opposed to the Christian and Latin-speaking Rome, and it was proposed that a new Eastern capital should represent the integration of the East into the Roman Empire as a whole, as a center of learning, prosperity, and cultural preservation for the whole of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Dagron, ''Naissance d'une Capitale'',  24&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various locations proposed for this alternative capital, Constantine appears to have toyed earlier with [[History of Sofia|Serdica]] (present-day [[Sofia]]), as he was reported saying that &quot;''Serdica is my Rome''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrus Patricius]] ''excerpta Vaticana'', 190: Κωνσταντίνος εβουλεύσατο πρώτον εν Σαρδική μεταγαγείν τά δημόσια· φιλών τε τήν πόλιν εκείνην συνεχώς έλεγεν &quot;η εμή Ρώμη Σαρδική εστι.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirmium]] and [[Thessalonica]] were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey MacMullen, ''Constantine'', [[Routledge]] ed., 1987, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, Constantine decided to work on the Greek city of [[Byzantium]], which offered the advantage of having already been extensively rebuilt on Roman patterns of urbanism, during the preceding century, by [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], who had already acknowledged its strategic importance.&lt;ref&gt;Dagron, ''Naissance d'une Capitale'', 15/19&lt;/ref&gt; The city was thus founded in 324,&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;&quot;Constantinople&quot; in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, 1991, p. 508. ISBN 0-19-504652-8&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated on 11 May 330&lt;ref name=Oxf/&gt; and renamed ''Constantinopolis'' (&quot;Constantine's City&quot; or [[Constantinople]] in English). Special commemorative coins were issued in 330 to honor the event. The new city was protected by the relics of the [[True Cross]], the [[Nehushtan|Rod of Moses]] and other holy [[relic]]s, though a cameo now at the [[Hermitage Museum]] also represented Constantine crowned by the [[tyche]] of the new city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagerooms.com/exhibitions/Byzantium/sardonyx.asp Sardonyx cameo depicting constantine the great crowned by Constantinople, 4th century AD] at &quot;The Road to Byzantium: Luxury Arts of Antiquity&quot;. ''The Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House'' (30 March 2006&amp;nbsp;– 3 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The figures of old gods were either replaced or assimilated into a framework of [[Christian symbolism]]. Constantine built the new [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] on the site of a temple to [[Aphrodite]]. Generations later there was the story that a [[Vision (religion)|divine vision]] led Constantine to this spot, and an [[angel]] no one else could see, led him on a circuit of the new walls. The capital would often be compared to the 'old' Rome as ''Nova Roma Constantinopolitana'', the &quot;New Rome of Constantinople&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;macmullen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city &quot;New Rome&quot; (''Nova Roma'' or ''Nea Rhome''). Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (Michael Grant, ''The Climax of Rome'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1968), 133). It is possible that the emperor called the city &quot;Second Rome&quot; (''Deutera Rhome'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian Socrates of Constantinople.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious policy===

Constantine was the first emperor to stop Christian persecutions and to legalise Christianity along with all other religions and cults in the Roman Empire.

In February 313, Constantine met with Licinius in Milan, where they developed the [[Edict of Milan]]. The edict stated that Christians should be allowed to follow the faith without oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Bowder, Diana. ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|many had been martyred previously]], and returned confiscated [[Christian Church|Church]] property. The edict protected from religious persecution not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever [[deity]] they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by [[Galerius]], then senior emperor of the [[Tetrarchy]]; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practise their religion but did not restore any property to them.&lt;ref&gt;See Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.

Scholars debate whether Constantine adopted his mother [[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]]'s Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55. Also, Percival J. [http://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/On+the+Question+of+Constantine%27s+Conversion+to+Christianity On the Question of Constantine's Conversion to Christianity], Clio History Journal, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine would retain the title of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' until his death, a title emperors bore as heads of the pagan priesthood, as would his Christian successors on to [[Gratian]] (''r''. 375–383). According to Christian writers, Constantine was over 40 when he finally declared himself a Christian, writing to Christians to make clear that he believed he owed his successes to the protection of the Christian High God alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''The Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his rule, Constantine supported the Church financially, built basilicas, granted privileges to clergy (e.g. exemption from certain taxes), promoted Christians to high office, and returned property confiscated during the Diocletianic persecution.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous building projects include the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]].

However, Constantine certainly did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining victory in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the [[Arch of Constantine]]—was built (315) to celebrate his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]. At the time of its dedication, sacrifices to gods like [[Apollo]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], and [[Hercules]] were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''apud'' Jonathan Bardill, '' Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age''. Cambridge University Press, 2011, ISBN 978-0-521-76423-0, page 307, note 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 321, Constantine instructed that Christians and non-Christians should be united in observing the '''venerable day of the sun''', or Sunday referring to the [[Sol Invictus|sun-worship]] that [[Aurelian]] had established as an official cult. Furthermore, and long after his oft alleged conversion to Christianity, Constantine's coinage continued to carry the symbols of the sun. Even after the pagan gods had disappeared from the coinage, Christian symbols appeared only as Constantine's ''personal'' attributes: the [[chi rho]] between his hands or on his [[labarum]], but never on the coin itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paul Veyne, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Constantine dedicated the new capital of Constantinople, which became the seat of Byzantine Christianity for a millennium, he did so wearing the [[Apollo]]nian sun-rayed [[Diadem]]; no Christian symbols were present at this dedication.

[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine burning [[Arianism|Arian]] books]]
The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over [[Arianism]], and the nature of God. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) 14–15; ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  One way in which Constantine used his influence over the early Church councils was to seek to establish a consensus over the oft debated and argued issue over the nature of God.

Most notably, from 313 to 316 bishops in North Africa struggled with other Christian bishops who had been ordained by Donatus in opposition to Caecilian. The African bishops could not come to terms and the Donatists asked Constantine to act as a judge in the dispute. Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the [[Donatism]] movement in North Africa. In 317 Constantine issued an edict to confiscate Donatist church property and to send Donatist clergy into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C., &quot;The Donatist Church; A Movement of Protest in Roman North Africa,&quot; (1952 Oxford), pp.156–162&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], effectively the first [[Ecumenical Council]] (unless the [[Council of Jerusalem]] is so classified). The Council of Nicaea is most known for its dealing with [[Arianism]] and for instituting the [[Nicene Creed]].

Constantine enforced the prohibition of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] against celebrating the Lord's Supper on the day before the Jewish [[Passover]] (14 ''[[Nisan]]'') (see [[Quartodecimanism]] and [[Easter controversy]]). This marked a definite break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman [[Julian Calendar]], a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunisolar [[Hebrew Calendar]] among the Christian churches of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm ''Life of Constantine'' Vol. III Ch. XVIII] by Eusebius; [http://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.i.x.html The Epistle of the Emperor Constantine, concerning the matters transacted at the council, addressed to those Bishops who were not present]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine made new laws regarding the [[Jews]]. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to [[brit milah|circumcise]] their slaves.

===Administrative reforms===
[[File:0 Constantinus I - Palazzo dei Conservatori (2).JPG|thumb|upright
|Head of Constantine's colossal statue at the [[Capitoline Museums]]. The original statue of marble was [[acrolith]]ic with the torso consisting of a [[cuirass]] in bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner, ''Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph'', 64, fig.32&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Beginning in the mid-3rd century the emperors began to favor members of the [[equestrian order]] over senators, who had had a monopoly on the most important offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 241&lt;/ref&gt;), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.

In 326, Constantine reversed this pro-equestrian trend, raising many administrative positions to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices to the old aristocracy, and at the same time elevating the rank of already existing equestrians office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank &lt;ref&gt;As equestrian ''order'' refers to people of equestrian ''census''—thousands of which had no state function—that had an actual position in the state bureaucracy: cf. Claude Lepelley, &quot;Fine delle' ordine equestre: le tappe delle'unificazione dela classe dirigente romana nel IV secolo&quot;, IN Giardina, ed., ''Società romana e impero tardoantico'', Bari: Laterza, 1986, V.1, quoted by Carrié &amp; Rouselle, p.660&lt;/ref&gt;—in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of ''perfectissimus'' was granted only to mid-low officials.

By the new Constantinian arrangement, one could become a senator, either by being elected [[praetor]] or (in most cases) by fulfilling a function of senatorial rank:&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247; Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658.&lt;/ref&gt; from then on, holding of actual power and social status were melded together into a joint imperial hierarchy. At the same time, Constantine gained with this the support of the old nobility,&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658–59.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Senate was allowed itself to elect praetors and [[quaestors]], in place of the usual practice of the emperors directly creating new magistrates (''adlectio''). In one inscription in honor of [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] (336–337) Ceionius Rufus Albinus, it was written that Constantine had restored the Senate &quot;the ''[[auctoritas]]'' it had lost at Caesar's time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_de?p_belegstelle=CIL+06%2C+01708&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle]; Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 659. {{wayback|url=http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_de?p_belegstelle=CIL+06%2C+01708&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle |date=20120720213655 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate as a body remained devoid of any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 660.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arnhein, ''The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire'', quoted by Perry Anderson, ''Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism'', 101.&lt;/ref&gt; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the fact that we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, &quot;Statistics and the Conversion of the Roman Aristocracy&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 85,1995, quoted by Carrié &amp; Rousselle, p.657&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's reforms had to do only with the civilian administration: the military chiefs, who since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] had risen from the ranks,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; remained outside the senate, in which they were included only by Constantine's children.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary reforms===
After the [[Crisis of the Third Century#Economic impact|runaway inflation of the third century]], associated with the production of [[fiat money]] to pay for public expenses, Diocletian had tried unsuccessfully to reestablish trustworthy minting of silver and [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] coins. The failure of the various Diocletianic attempts at the restoration of a functioning silver coin resided in the fact that the silver currency was overvalued in terms of its actual metal content, and therefore could only circulate at much discounted rates. Minting of the Diocletianic &quot;pure&quot; silver ''[[argenteus]]'' ceased, therefore, soon after 305, while the billon currency continued to be used until the 360s. From the early 300s on, Constantine forsook any attempts at restoring the silver currency, preferring instead to concentrate on minting large quantities of good standard gold pieces—the [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], 72 of which made a pound of gold. New (and highly debased) silver pieces would continue to be issued during Constantine's later reign and after his death, in a continuous process of retariffing, until this bullion minting eventually ceased, ''de jure'', in 367, with the silver piece being ''de facto'' continued by various denominations of bronze coins, the most important being the ''[[centenionalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scheidel, &quot;The Monetary Systems of the Han and Roman Empires&quot;, 174/175&lt;/ref&gt; These bronze pieces continued to be devalued, assuring the possibility of keeping fiduciary minting alongside a gold standard. The anonymous author of the possibly contemporary treatise on military affairs ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' held that, as a consequence of this monetary policy, the rift between classes widened: the rich benefited from the stability in purchasing power of the gold piece, while the poor had to cope with ever-degrading bronze pieces.&lt;ref&gt;''De Rebus Bellicis'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later emperors like [[Julian the Apostate]] tried to present themselves as advocates of the ''humiles'' by insisting on trustworthy mintings of the bronze currency.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Mazzarino, according to Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's monetary policy were closely associated with his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melded for immediate minting—with the exception of a number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 245–246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executions of Crispus and Fausta===
On some date between 15 May and 17 June 326, Constantine had his eldest son [[Crispus]], by Minervina, seized and put to death by &quot;cold poison&quot; at Pola ([[Pula]], [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 325–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Constantine had his wife, the Empress [[Fausta]], killed at the behest of his mother, Helena. Fausta was left to die in an over-heated bath.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 326; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Their names were wiped from the face of many inscriptions, references to their lives in the literary record were erased, and the memory of both was condemned. [[Eusebius]], for example, edited praise of Crispus out of later copies of his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', and his ''Vita Constantini'' contains no mention of Fausta or Crispus at all.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 326; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Few ancient sources are willing to discuss possible motives for the events; those few that do, offer unconvincing rationales, are of later provenance, and are generally unreliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Roman Empire |date=2008 |publisher=MobileReference.com |isbn=978-1-60501-314-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62Qf64DdGu0C|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the executions, it was commonly believed that the Empress Fausta was either in an illicit relationship with Crispus, or was spreading rumors to that effect. A popular myth arose, modified to allude to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]–[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] legend, with the suggestion that Constantine killed Crispus and Fausta for their immoralities.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUTH326.7&quot;&gt;Guthrie, 326–27.&lt;/ref&gt; One source, the largely fictional ''Passion of Artemius'', probably penned in the eighth century by [[John of Damascus]], makes the legendary connection explicit.&lt;ref&gt;''Art. Pass'' 45; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; As an interpretation of the executions, the myth rests on only &quot;the slimmest of evidence&quot;: sources that allude to the relationship between Crispus and Fausta are late and unreliable, and the modern suggestion that Constantine's &quot;godly&quot; edicts of 326 and the irregularities of Crispus are somehow connected rests on no evidence at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUTH326.7&quot; /&gt;

Although Constantine created his apparent heirs &quot;Caesars&quot;, following a pattern established by Diocletian, he gave his creations a hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were to be kept in the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, as long as he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 237/238&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep a firm grip on his prospective heirs, this—and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their half-brother—being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in &quot;killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Adrian Goldsworthy, ''How Rome Fell'', 189 &amp; 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later campaigns===
[[File:ConstantineEmpire.png|thumb|The Roman Empire in 337, showing Constantine's conquests in Dacia across the lower Danube (shaded purple) and other Roman dependencies (light purple).]]
Constantine considered Constantinople as his capital and permanent residence. He lived there for a good portion of his later life. He rebuilt Trajan's bridge across the Danube, in hopes of reconquering [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the [[Sarmatian]]s against the [[Goth]]s. The weather and lack of food cost the Goths dearly: reportedly, nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Rome. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in Illyrian and Roman districts, and conscripted the rest into the army. Constantine took the title ''Dacicus maximus'' in 336.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman - Imperial Medallion of Constantine I - Walters 59690.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gold medallion struck at [[Nicomedia]] in 336–337 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his rule]]
In the last years of his life Constantine made plans for a campaign against [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]]. In a letter written to the king of Persia, [[Shapur II|Shapur]], Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''VC'' 4.9ff, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent in the shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the [[Jordan River]] before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 258–59. See also: Fowden, &quot;Last Days&quot;, 146–48, and Wiemer, 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sickness and death===
[[File:Raphael Baptism Constantine.jpg|thumb|''[[The Baptism of Constantine]]'', as imagined by students of [[Raphael]]]]
Constantine had known death would soon come. Within the Church of the Holy Apostles, Constantine had secretly prepared a final resting-place for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.58–60; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; It came sooner than he had expected. Soon after the Feast of Easter 337, Constantine fell seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.61; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Constantinople for the hot baths near his mother's city of Helenopolis (Altinova), on the southern shores of the Gulf of İzmit. There, in a church his mother built in honor of Lucian the Apostle, he prayed, and there he realized that he was dying. Seeking purification, he became a [[catechumen]], and attempted a return to Constantinople, making it only as far as a suburb of Nicomedia.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.&lt;/ref&gt; He summoned the bishops, and told them of his hope to be baptized in the [[River Jordan]], where Christ was written to have been baptized. He requested the baptism right away, promising to live a more Christian life should he live through his illness. The bishops, Eusebius records, &quot;performed the sacred ceremonies according to custom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the Arianizing bishop [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], bishop of the [[Nicomedia|city]] where he lay dying, as his baptizer.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In postponing his baptism, he followed one custom at the time which postponed baptism until after infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Because he was so old, he could not be submerged in water to be baptised, and therefore, the rules of baptism were changed to what they are today, having water placed on the forehead alone. In this period infant baptism, though practiced (usually in circumstances of emergency) had not yet become a matter of routine in the west. Thomas M.

Although Constantine's death follows the conclusion of the Persian campaign in Eusebius's account, most other sources report his death as occurring in its middle. Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (a nephew of Constantine), writing in the mid-350s, observes that the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]]s escaped punishment for their ill-deeds, because Constantine died &quot;in the middle of his preparations for war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Orations'' 1.18.b.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accounts are given in the ''Origo Constantini'', an anonymous document composed while Constantine was still living, and which has Constantine dying in Nicomedia;&lt;ref&gt;''Origo Constantini'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Historiae abbreviatae'' of Sextus Aurelius Victor, written in 361, which has Constantine dying at an estate near Nicomedia called Achyrona while marching against the Persians;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Aurelius Victor, ''Historiae abbreviatae'' XLI.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Breviarium'' of Eutropius, a handbook compiled in 369 for the Emperor [[Valens]], which has Constantine dying in a nameless state villa in Nicomedia.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Breviarium'' X.8.2.&lt;/ref&gt; From these and other accounts, some have concluded that Eusebius's ''Vita'' was edited to defend Constantine's reputation against what Eusebius saw as a less congenial version of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, &quot;Last Days of Constantine,&quot; 148–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death, his body was transferred to Constantinople and buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]]. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews [[Dalmatius]] (who held the rank of Caesar) and [[Hannibalianus]], presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, [[Constantina]] and [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], wife of [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]].&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 71, figure 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he earned his honorific of &quot;The Great&quot; (&quot;Μέγας&quot;) from Christian historians long after he had died, he could have claimed the title on his military achievements and victories alone. Besides reuniting the Empire under one emperor, Constantine won major victories over the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]] in 306–308, the Franks again in 313–314, the [[Goths]] in 332 and the [[Sarmatians]] in 334. By 336, Constantine had reoccupied most of the long-lost province of [[Dacia]], which [[Aurelian]] had been forced to abandon in 271. At the time of his death, he was planning a great expedition to end raids on the eastern provinces from the Persian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Serving for a total of almost 31 years (combining his years as co-ruler and sole ruler), he was also the longest serving emperor since [[Augustus]] and the second longest serving emperor in Roman history.

In the cultural sphere Constantine contributed to the revival of the clean shaven face fashion of the Roman emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Trajan]], which was originally introduced among the Romans by [[Scipio Africanus]]. This new Roman imperial fashion lasted until the reign of [[Phocas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byzantium.xronikon.com/statfirst.html |title=Byzantine first &amp; last times |publisher=Byzantium.xronikon.com |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Barba |title=Barba – NumisWiki, The Collaborative Numismatics Project |publisher=Forumancientcoins.com |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byzantine Empire considered Constantine its founder and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reckoned him among the venerable figures of its tradition. In the later Byzantine state, it had become a great honor for an emperor to be hailed as a &quot;new Constantine&quot;. Ten emperors, including the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, carried the name.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental Constantinian forms were used at the court of [[Charlemagne]] to suggest that he was Constantine's successor and equal. Constantine acquired a mythic role as a warrior against &quot;heathens&quot;. The motif of the Romanesque equestrian, the mounted figure in the posture of a triumphant Roman emperor, became a visual metaphor in statuary in praise of local benefactors. The name &quot;Constantine&quot; itself enjoyed renewed popularity in western France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, 237–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Nicene churches consider Constantine a saint (Άγιος Κωνσταντίνος, Saint Constantine).&lt;ref name=&quot;POHL83-87&quot;&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Orthodox Church he is called ''isapostolos'' (Ισαπόστολος Κωνσταντίνος)—an [[equal-to-apostles|equal of the Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Niš Airport]] is named &quot;Constantine the Great&quot; in honor of him. A [[Constantine the Great Cross|large Cross]] was planned to be built on a hill overlooking Niš, but the project was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niš: Vinik osta pusto brdo |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:372896-Nis-Vinik-osta-pusto-brdo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a memorial was erected in Niš in his honor. The ''Commemoration of the Edict of Milan'' was held in Niš in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=84193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
During his life and those of his sons, Constantine was presented as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as [[Praxagoras of Athens]] and [[Libanius]] showered him with praise. When the last of his sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) [[Julian the Apostate]] wrote the satire ''Symposium, or the Saturnalia'', which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 272–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Julian, [[Eunapius]] began—and [[Zosimus]] continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Peter Paul Rubens - Constantius appoints Constantine as his successor - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Constantius I|Constantius]] appoints Constantine as his successor'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], 1622]]
In medieval times, when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was dominant, Catholic historians presented Constantine as an ideal ruler, the standard against which any king or emperor could be measured.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273; Odahl, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renaissance]] rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources prompted a re-evaluation of Constantine's career. The German humanist [[Johannes Leunclavius|Johann Löwenklau]], discoverer of Zosimus' writings, published a Latin translation thereof in 1576. In its preface, he argued that Zosimus' picture of Constantine was superior to that offered by Eusebius and the Church historians, and damned Constantine as a tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Leunclavius]], ''Apologia pro Zosimo adversus Evagrii, Nicephori Callisti et aliorum acerbas criminationes'' (''Defence of Zosimus against the Unjustified Charges of Evagrius, Nicephorus Callistus, and Others'') (Basel, 1576), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273, and Odahl, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]], a man of the [[Counter-Reformation]], criticized Zosimus, favoring Eusebius' account of the Constantinian era. Baronius' ''Life of Constantine'' (1588) presents Constantine as the model of a Christian prince.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar Baronius, ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' 3 (Antwerp, 1623), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; For his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–89), [[Edward Gibbon]], aiming to unite the two extremes of Constantinian scholarship, offered a portrait of Constantine built on the contrasted narratives of Eusebius and Zosimus.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' Chapter 18, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282. See also Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In a form that parallels his account of the empire's decline, Gibbon presents a noble war hero corrupted by Christian influences, who transforms into an Oriental despot in his old age: &quot;a hero&amp;nbsp;... degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', 1.256; David P. Jordan, &quot;Gibbon's 'Age of Constantine' and the Fall of Rome&quot;, ''History and Theory'' 8:1 (1969): 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interpretations of Constantine's rule begin with [[Jacob Burckhardt]]'s ''The Age of Constantine the Great'' (1853, rev. 1880). Burckhardt's Constantine is a scheming secularist, a politician who manipulates all parties in a quest to secure his own power.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Burckhardt, ''Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen'' (Basel, 1853; revised edition, Leipzig, 1880), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], writing in the 1930s, followed Burckhardt's evaluation of Constantine. For Grégoire, Constantine developed an interest in Christianity only after witnessing its political usefulness. Grégoire was skeptical of the authenticity of Eusebius' ''Vita'', and postulated a pseudo-Eusebius to assume responsibility for the vision and conversion narratives of that work.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Seeck]], in ''Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt'' (1920–23), and André Piganiol, in ''L'empereur Constantin'' (1932), wrote against this historiographic tradition. Seeck presented Constantine as a sincere war hero, whose ambiguities were the product of his own naïve inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Piganiol's Constantine is a philosophical monotheist, a child of his era's religious syncretism.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Related histories by [[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|A.H.M. Jones]] (''Constantine and the Conversion of Europe'', 1949) and [[Ramsay MacMullen]] (''Constantine'', 1969) gave portraits of a less visionary, and more impulsive, Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

These later accounts were more willing to present Constantine as a genuine convert to Christianity. Beginning with [[Norman H. Baynes]]' ''Constantine the Great and the Christian Church'' (1929) and reinforced by [[Andreas Alföldi]]'s ''The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome'' (1948), a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian. [[Timothy Barnes|T. D. Barnes]]'s seminal ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (1981) represents the culmination of this trend. Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion, which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 8–9; Odahl, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Matson Odahl's recent ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004) takes much the same tack.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 283; Mark Humphries, &quot;Constantine,&quot; review of ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', by Charles Odahl, ''Classical Quarterly'' 56:2 (2006), 449.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Barnes' work, arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion continue.&lt;ref&gt;Averil Cameron, &quot;Introduction,&quot; in ''Constantine: History, Historiography, and Legend'', ed. Samuel N.C. Lieu and [[Dominic Montserrat]] (New York: Routledge, 1998), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's ''The Christianity of Constantine the Great'' (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar view of Constantine is held in [[Paul Veyne]]'s recent (2007) work, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', which does not speculate on the origins of Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him, in his role as Emperor, as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant &quot;to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6404/is_2_69/ai_n29437350/?tag=content;col1 Quand notre monde est devenu chretien]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}, Fabian E. Udoh, review, ''Theological Studies'', June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation of Constantine===
{{main|Donation of Constantine}}
[[Latin Rite]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] considered it inappropriate that Constantine was baptized only on his death-bed and by an unorthodox bishop, as it undermined the authority of the Papacy. Hence, by the early fourth century, a legend had emerged that [[Pope Sylvester I]] (314–335) had cured the pagan emperor from [[leprosy]]. According to this legend, Constantine was soon baptized, and began the construction of a church in the [[Lateran Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 298–301.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth century, most likely during the pontificate of [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II]] (752–757), a document called the [[Donation of Constantine]] first appeared, in which the freshly converted Constantine hands the temporal rule over &quot;the city of [[Rome]] and all the provinces, districts, and cities of [[Italy]] and the Western regions&quot; to Sylvester and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitutum Constantini'' 17, qtd. in Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 301–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[High Middle Ages]], this document was used and accepted as the basis for the Pope's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], though it was denounced as a forgery by Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, &quot;The 'Donation of Constantine'&quot;. ''The English Historical Review'' 10: 37 (1895), 86–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and lamented as the root of papal worldliness by the poet [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'' 19.115; ''Paradisio'' 20.55; cf. ''De Monarchia'' 3.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th century philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved the document was indeed a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Fubini, 79–86; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia''===
During the medieval period, [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] regarded Constantine as a king of their own people, particularly associating him with [[Segontium|Caernarfon]] in [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. While some of this is owed to his fame and his proclamation as Emperor in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], there was also confusion of his family with [[Magnus Maximus]]'s supposed wife [[Saint Elen]] and her son, another Constantine {{nowrap|({{lang-cy|Custennin}})}}. In the 12th century [[Henry of Huntingdon]] included a passage in his ''Historia Anglorum'' that the emperor Constantine's mother was a Briton, making her the daughter of [[King Cole]] of [[Colchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''Historia Anglorum'', Book I, ch. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] expanded this story in his highly fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', an account of the supposed [[list of legendary kings of Britain|Kings of Britain]] from their [[Troy|Trojan]] origins to the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenway&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Greenway|first1= Diana (Ed.) |author2=Henry of Huntingdon|title= Historia Anglorum: The History of the English People|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1996|isbn= 0-19-822224-6|page=civ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geoffrey, Cole was King of the Britons when Constantius, here a senator, came to Britain. Afraid of the Romans, Cole submitted to Roman law so long as he retained his kingship. However, he died only a month later, and Constantius took the throne himself, marrying Cole's daughter Helena. They had their son Constantine, who succeeded his father as King of Britain before becoming Roman Emperor.

Historically, this series of events is extremely improbable. Constantius had already left Helena by the time he left for Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;/&gt; Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though it may have been a lost hagiography of Helena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenway&quot;/&gt;

'''Constans''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Iulius Constans Augustus}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;&gt;Jones, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; c. 323&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:23&lt;/ref&gt; – 350) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 350. He defeated his brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] in 340, but anger in the army over his personal life and preference for his barbarian bodyguards led the general [[Magnentius]] to rebel, resulting in the assassination of Constans in 350.

==Career==
Constans was the third and youngest son of [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Fausta]], his father's second wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constans I (337–350 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at the court of his father at [[Constantinople]] under the tutelage of the poet [[Aemilius Magnus Arborius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; 

On 25 December 333, Constantine I elevated Constans to the rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; Constans became engaged to [[Olympias of Armenia|Olympias]], the daughter of the [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Ablabius (consul 331)|Ablabius]], but the marriage never came to pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; With Constantine’s death in 337, Constans and his two brothers, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constantius II]], divided the Roman world between themselves&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;&gt;Eutropius, 10:9&lt;/ref&gt; and disposed of virtually all relatives who could possibly have a claim to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:20&lt;/ref&gt; The army proclaimed them ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'' on September 9, 337.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; Almost immediately, Constans was required to deal with a [[Sarmatian]] invasion in late 337, over whom he won a resounding victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from left to right, the territories of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], Constans, [[Dalmatius]] and [[Constantius II]]. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]
Constans was initially under the guardianship of Constantine II.  The original settlement assigned Constans the [[praetorian prefectures]] of [[praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italy and Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Constans was unhappy with this division, so the brothers met at [[Viminacium]] in 338 to revise the boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;/&gt; Constans managed to extract the prefecture of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and the [[diocese of Thrace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;/&gt; provinces that were originally to be ruled by his cousin [[Dalmatius]], as per Constantine I’s proposed division after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;/&gt; Constantine II soon complained that he had not received the amount of territory that was his due as the eldest son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  

Annoyed that Constans had received Thrace and [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] after the death of Dalmatius, Constantine demanded that Constans hand over the African provinces, which he agreed to do in order to maintain a fragile peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, however, they began quarreling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to [[Carthage]], and thus Constantine, and which belonged to [[Italy]], and therefore Constans.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:41-42&lt;/ref&gt; This led to growing tensions between the two brothers, which were only heightened by Constans finally coming of age and Constantine refusing to give up his guardianship. In 340 Constantine II invaded Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt; Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; Constantine was eventually trapped at [[Aquileia]], where he died, leaving Constans to inherit all of his brother’s former territories – [[Hispania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt;

[[File:146 Constans.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze coin of Constans]] Constans began his reign in an energetic fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt; In 341-42, he led a successful campaign against the [[Franks]], and in the early months of 343 he visited [[Roman Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The source for this visit, [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]], does not provide a reason, but the quick movement and the danger involved in crossing the [[English Channel|channel]] in the dangerous winter months suggests it was in response to a military emergency, possibly to repel the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Regarding religion, Constans was tolerant of [[Judaism]] and promulgated an edict banning pagan sacrifices in 341.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He suppressed [[Donatism]] in Africa and supported [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene orthodoxy]] against [[Arianism]], which was championed by his brother Constantius. Although Constans called the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343 to settle the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 2, chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a complete failure,&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, 1930, Patrick J. Healy, Sardica&lt;/ref&gt; and by 346 the two emperors were on the point of open warfare over the dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict was only resolved by an interim agreement which allowed each emperor to support their preferred clergy within their own spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt;

The Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] says he &quot;indulged in great vices&quot; in reference to his [[homosexuality]]; and [[Aurelius Victor]] that he had a reputation for scandalous behaviour with &quot;handsome barbarian hostages&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Constans did sponsor a decree alongside Constantius II that ruled that marriage based on unnatural sex should be punished meticulously. Boswell believed the decree outlawed homosexual marriages only&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexualit'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be that Constans was not expressing his own feeling when promulgating the legislation, but rather trying to placate public outrage at his own indecencies.

==Death==
In the final years of his reign, Constans developed a reputation for cruelty and misrule.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:42&lt;/ref&gt; Dominated by favourites and openly preferring his select bodyguard, he lost the support of the [[Roman legion|legions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; In 350, the general [[Magnentius]] declared himself emperor at [[Augustodunum]] with the support of the troops on the [[Rhine]] frontier, and later the western provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, 10:9:4&lt;/ref&gt; Constans was enjoying himself nearby when he was notified of the elevation of Magnentius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Lacking any support beyond his immediate household,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; he was forced to flee for his life. As he was trying to reach either Italy or Spain, supporters of Magnentius cornered him in a fortification in [[Vicus Helena]] (now [[Elne]]) in the [[Pyrenees]], southwestern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:21:23&lt;/ref&gt; where he was killed after seeking sanctuary in a temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt;

'''Constantius II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Julius Constantius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Constantius' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS IVLIVS CONSTANTIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIL 06, 40776 = AE 1934, 00158 = AE 1950, 00174 = AE 1951, 00102 = AE 1982, 00011&lt;/ref&gt; 7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 361. The second son of [[Constantine I]] and [[Fausta]], he ascended to the throne with his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans]] upon their father's death.

In 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius defeated him at the battles of [[Battle of Mursa Major|Mursa Major]] and [[Battle of Mons Seleucus|Mons Seleucus]].  Magnentius committed suicide after the latter, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire.

His subsequent military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the [[Alamanni]] in 354 and campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] in 357. In contrast, the war in the east against the [[Sassanids]] continued with mixed results.

In 351, due to the difficulty of managing the empire alone, Constantius elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to the subordinate rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], to the rank of ''Caesar''.

However, Julian claimed the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 360, leading to war between the two. Ultimately, no battle was fought as Constantius became ill and died late in 361, though not before naming his opponent as his successor.

After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]
Constantius was born in 317 at [[Sirmium]], [[Pannonia]]. He was the third son of [[Constantine the Great]], and second by his second wife [[Fausta]], the daughter of [[Maximian]]. Constantius was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by his father on 13 November 324.&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio Jr., M. &amp; Frakes, R. 'DIR-Constantius II' from De Imperatoribus Romanis [http://www.roman-emperors.org/constaii.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 336, religious unrest in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and tense relations between Constantine and king [[Shapur II]] caused war to break out between Rome and [[Sassanid Persia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon, M.H p152-153&quot;&gt;Dodgeon, M.H. and Lieu, N.C. ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars, AD 226–363''. p152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Though he made initial preparations for the war, Constantine fell ill and sent Constantius east to take command of the eastern frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon, M.H p152-153&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Orationes'' I, 13B&lt;/ref&gt; Before Constantius arrived, the Persian general Narses, who was possibly the king's brother, overran [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] and captured [[Diyarbakir|Amida]]. Constantius promptly attacked Narses, and after suffering minor setbacks defeated and killed Narses at the [[Battle of Narasara]].&lt;ref&gt;Festus, ''breviarum'' 27, p. 67, 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius captured Amida and initiated a major refortification the city, enhancing the city's circuit walls and constructing large towers. He also built a new stronghold in the hinterland nearby, naming it ''Antinopolis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus XVIII, 9, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 337, Constantius hurried to [[Constantinople]] after receiving news that his father was near death.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicon Paschale'' p.533, 5–17&lt;/ref&gt; After Constantine died, Constantius buried him  with lavish ceremony in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''or''. I, 18D-19A (14.16–22, pp. 31–2, Bidez)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his father's death Constantius supposedly ordered a massacre of his relatives descended from the second marriage of his paternal grandfather [[Constantius Chlorus]], though the details are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;X. Lucien-Brun, &quot;Constance II et le massacre des princes,&quot; ''Bulletin de l'[[Association Guillaume Budé]]'' ser. 4 (1973): 585–602; Joe W. Leedom, &quot;Constantius II: Three Revisions,&quot; ''Byzantion'' 48 (1978): 132–145, and Michael DiMaio and Duane Arnold, &quot;Per Vim, Per Caedem, Per Bellum: A Study of Murder and Ecclesiastical Politics in the Year 337 A.D,&quot; ''Byzantion'', 62(1992), 158ff. Cited in DiMaio and Frakes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], writing between 350 and 370, states that Constantius merely sanctioned “''the act, rather than commanding it''”.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.9&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre killed two of Constantius' uncles and six of his cousins,&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''epistula ad Athenienses'' 270C (3.5–8, p. 215, Bidez)&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Hannibalianus]] and [[Dalmatius]], rulers of [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Diocese of Moesia|Moesia]] respectively. The massacre left Constantius, his older brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], his younger brother [[Constans]], and three cousins [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]], [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] and [[Nepotianus]] as the only surviving male relatives of Constantine the Great.

Soon after, Constantius met his brothers in [[Pannonia]] at [[Sirmium]] to formalize the partition of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, C.M., ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius received the eastern provinces, including Constantinople, [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Cyrenaica]]; Constantine received [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Mauretania Tingitana|Mauretania]]; and Constans, initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]], [[Africa Province|Africa]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Pannonia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius then hurried east to [[Antioch]] to resume the war with Persia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Theodoret, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' II, 30, 1–14, GCS&lt;/ref&gt; While Constantius was away from the eastern frontier in early 337, Shapur assembled a large army, which included war elephants, and launched an attack on Roman territory, laying waste to Mesopotamia&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Chronicon, s. a.'' 338 p. 234, 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; and putting the city of Nisibis under siege.&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, ''Historia religiosa'' I, 11–12, edd. Canivet and Leroy-Molinghen, pp. 184–8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial success, Shapur lifted his siege after his army missed an opportunity to exploit a collapsed wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; When Constantius learned of Shapur's withdrawal from Roman territory, he prepared his army for a counter-attack, drilling them.

Constantius repeatedly defended the eastern border against invasions by the aggressive [[Sassanid Empire]] under king [[Shapur II]]. These conflicts were mainly limited to Sassanid sieges of the major fortresses of [[Roman Mesopotamia]], including [[Nisibis]] ([[Nusaybin]]), [[Singara]], and [[Diyarbakir|Amida]] ([[Diyarbakir]]). Although Shapur seems to have been victorious in most of these confrontations, the Sassanids were able to achieve little.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[Festus (historian)|Festus]], ''Brevarium'' XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89&quot;&gt;Dignas, B. &amp; Winter, E., ''Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity'' (2007), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans won a decisive victory at the Battle of Narasara, killing Shapur's brother, Narses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], ''Chronicle'' A.M. 5815&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Constantius was able to push back the invasion, and Shapur failed to make any significant gains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, Constantine II desired to retain control of Constans' realm, leading the brothers into open conflict. Constantine was killed in 340 near [[Aquileia]] during an ambush.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; As a result, Constans took control of his deceased brother’s realms and became sole ruler of the Western two-thirds of the empire. This division lasted until 350, when Constans was assassinated by forces loyal to the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]] ''New History'' II.58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Magnentius===
[[File:Bronze coin of Contantius II 337 361 found in Karghalik.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of Constantius II (337–361), found in [[Karghalik]], modern [[China]].]]

As the only surviving son of [[Constantine the Great]], Constantius felt that the position of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] was his alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus, New History II.60&quot;&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60&lt;/ref&gt; and he determined to march west to fight the usurper, [[Magnentius]]. However, feeling that the east still required some sort of imperial presence, he elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to Caesar of the eastern provinces. As an extra measure to ensure the loyalty of his cousin, he married the elder of his two sisters, [[Constantina]], to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus, New History II.60&quot;/&gt;

Before facing Magnentius, Constantius first came to terms with [[Vetranio]], a loyal general in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] who had recently been acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support. These events may have been spurred by the action of Constantina, who had since traveled east to marry Gallus. Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general‘s new position as ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]''. However, when Constantius arrived, Vetranio willingly resigned his position and accepted Constantius’ offer of a comfortable retirement in [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double Centenionalis Magnentius-XR-s4017.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The defeat of [[Magnentius]] in 353 left Constantius as sole [[Roman Emperor]].]]

In 351, Constantius clashed with Magnentius in [[Pannonia]] with a large army. The ensuing [[Battle of Mursa Major]] was one of the largest and bloodiest battles ever between two Roman armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.8.5–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''The Caesars'' XLII.9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.46.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Roman History'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for Constantius, but a costly one. Magnentius survived the battle and, determined to fight on, withdrew into northern Italy. Rather than pursuing his opponent, however, Constantius turned his attention to securing the Danubian border, where he spent the early months of 352 campaigning against the [[Sarmatians]] along the middle [[Danube]]. After achieving his aims, Constantius advanced on Magnentius in Italy. This action led the cities of Italy to switch their allegiance to him and eject the usurper's garrisons. Again, Magnentius withdrew, this time to southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474&quot;&gt;Potter, D.S., ''The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180–395'' (2004), p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

In 353, Constantius and Magnentius met for the final time at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in southern Gaul, and again Constantius emerged the victor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474&quot;/&gt; Magnentius, realizing the futility of continuing his position, committed suicide on 10 August 353.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sole ruler of the empire==
Constantius spent much of the rest of 353 and early 354 on campaign against the [[Alamanni]] on the Danube frontier. The campaign was successful and raiding by the Alamanni ceased temporarily. In the meantime, Constantius had been receiving disturbing reports regarding the actions of his cousin Gallus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' 14.1.10&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as a result of these reports, Constantius concluded a peace with the Alamanni and traveled to [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.10.16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solidus-Constantius Gallus-thessalonica RIC 149.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Constantius Gallus was a paternal cousin of Constantius. In 350, he was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by Constantius and was married to the Emperor's sister, [[Constantina]]. However, his mismanagement of the eastern provinces led to his downfall and death in 354.]]

In Mediolanum, Constantius first summoned [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], Gallus’ ''magister equitum'', for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.3–5&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius then summoned Gallus and Constantina.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.6&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gallus and Constantina complied with the order at first, when Constantina died in [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Gallus began to hesitate. However, after some convincing by one of Constantius’ agents,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus continued his journey west, passing through [[Constantinople]] and [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thrace]] to [[Poetovio]] ([[Ptuj]]) in [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm Banchich, T.M., 'DIR-Gallus' from De Imperatoribus Romanis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poetovio, Gallus was arrested by the soldiers of Constantius under the command of [[Barbatio]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.20&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus was then moved to [[Pula|Pola]] and interrogated. Gallus claimed that it was Constantina who was to blame for all the trouble while he was in charge of the eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.22&lt;/ref&gt; This angered Constantius so greatly that he immediately ordered Gallus' execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.23&lt;/ref&gt; He soon changed his mind, however, and recanted the order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.9.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XVIII.152&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Gallus, this second order was delayed by [[Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)|Eusebius]], one of Constantius' eunuchs, and Gallus was executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

===More usurpers and Julian===
On 11 August 355, the [[magister militum]] [[Claudius Silvanus]] revolted in Gaul. Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the [[Battle of Mursa Major]]. Constantius had made him magister militum in 353 with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius' court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter from Constantius recalling him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.

Constantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, however, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself. So on 6 November 355,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.17&lt;/ref&gt; he elevated his last remaining male relative, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.5–16&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Julian was married to [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], the last surviving sister of Constantius.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius soon sent Julian off to Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:07 constantius2Chrono354.png|thumb|right|300px|Constantius II depicted in the [[Chronography of 354]] dispensing largesse (a [[Renaissance]] copy of a [[Carolingian]] copy).]]

Constantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In 357 he visited [[Rome]] for the only time in his life. The same year, he forced [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Quadi]] invaders out of Pannonia and [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]], then led a successful counter-attack across the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVI.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 357–58, Constantius received ambassadors from [[Shapur II]] who demanded that Rome restore the lands surrendered by [[Narseh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.3–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.25-7&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rejecting these terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.9–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.28-9&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius tried to avert war with the [[Sassanid Empire]] by sending two embassies to Shapur II.&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Epistle'' 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.14.1–3 &amp; XVIII.6.17-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' VI. 5.1–10&lt;/ref&gt; Shapur II nevertheless launched another invasion of Roman Mesopotamia. In 360, when news reached Constantius that Shapur II had destroyed [[Singara]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.6&lt;/ref&gt; and taken [[Hasankeyf|Kiphas]] ([[Hasankeyf]]), [[Diyarbakır|Amida]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cizre|Ad Tigris]] ([[Cizre]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.7.1–16&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.

===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===
In the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the [[Alamanni]], who had once again invaded [[Roman Gaul]]. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian’s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian ''Augustus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''Letter To The Senate And People of Athens'', X.12–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XII.58 &amp; XVIII.90-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.15.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.4.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin’s usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of ''Augustus'' and be satisfied with that of ''Caesar''. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force; and yet the threat of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.11.6–25&lt;/ref&gt; After a time he had withdrawn to [[Antioch]] to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.7.7 &amp; 13.1–5&lt;/ref&gt; The campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids, however, and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian .&lt;ref name=&quot;Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508&quot;&gt;Vagi, D.L. &amp; Coquand, T., ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (2001), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Byzantine - Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina - Walters 57527 - Back.jpg|left|thumb|This section of a belt contains two gold medallions.  The larger coin depicts the triumphant emperor in his chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/#
 |title= Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Constantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached [[Mopsuestia]] in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. Apparently, realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by [[Arianism|Euzoius]], the [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] bishop of [[Antioch]], and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508&quot;/&gt; Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 21.15.2 reads ''tertium nonarum Octobrium'', which is the equivalent of 5 October. The latest editor of the ''Res Gestae'' accepts Otto Seeck's emendation ''tertium nonarum Novembrium'' which is the equivalent of 3 November. T.D. Barnes (''Classical Philology'', 88 [1993], p. 64f) provides indirect evidence showing 3 November is a better fit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and children==
Constantius II was married three times:

First to a [[Daughter of Julius Constantius|daughter]] of his half-uncle [[Julius Constantius]], whose name is unknown. She was a full-sister of Gallus and a half-sister of Julian. She died c. 352/3.

Second, to Eusebia, a woman of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] originally from the city of [[Thessaloniki]], whom Constantius married before his defeat of Magnentius in 353. She died in 360.

Third and lastly, in 360, to [[Faustina (empress)|Faustina]], who gave birth to Constantius' only child, a posthumous daughter named [[Flavia Maxima Constantia]], who later married Emperor [[Gratian]].

==Religious issues==
Constantius seems to have had a particular interest in the religious state of the [[Roman Empire]]. As a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Roman Emperor]], Constantius made a concerted effort to promote [[Christianity]] at the expense of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] (‘paganism’). He issued a number of edicts designed to carry out this agenda (see below). Constantius also took an active part in attempting to shape the [[Christianity|Christian]] church.

===Paganism===
In spite of the some of the edicts issued by Constantius, he was not fanatically anti-pagan – he never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68&quot;&gt;Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; he never acted against the various pagan schools, and, at times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68&quot;/&gt; Also, he remained [[pontifex maximus]] and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. His relative moderation toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was over twenty years after his death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senator protested his treatment of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pagan-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* The banning of sacrifices;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.2 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* The closing of pagan temples;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.4 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Edicts against soothsayers and magicians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 9.16.4, 9.16.5 &amp; 9.16.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Although often considered an [[Arianism|Arian]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between [[Arianism]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], retrospectively called [[Semi-Arianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan, J.J., ''The Christian Tradition'' (1989), pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, M., ''There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ'' (2005), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign he attempted to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, convening several Christian councils. The most notable of these were the [[Council of Rimini]] and its twin at [[Silifke|Seleuca]], which met in 359 and 360 respectively. &quot;Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious,&quot; writes the historian [[A.H.M. Jones]]. &quot;The great councils of 359–60 are therefore not reckoned [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a [[Arianism|heretic]] who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, A.H.M 1986 p. 118&quot;&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the clergy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the sons of clergy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tax exemptions for clergy and their servants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; and later for their family;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.14&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clergy and the issue of private property;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.15, 12.1.49 &amp; 8.4.7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bishops exempted from being tried in secular courts;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.12&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christian prostitutes only able to be bought by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 15.8.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Judaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1&quot;&gt;Schäfer, P., ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (2003), pp. 180–1&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his reign, Constantius issued a double edict in concert with his brothers limiting the ownership of slaves by Jewish people&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.9.2&lt;/ref&gt; and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt; A later edict issued by Constantius after becoming sole emperor decreed that a person who was proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism would have all of his property confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7&quot;&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.8.7&lt;/ref&gt; However, Constantius' actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as with Jewish business—apparently, privately owned Jewish businesses were often in competition with state-owned businesses. As a result, Constantius may have sought to provide an advantage to state-owned businesses by limiting the skilled workers and slaves available to Jewish businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1&quot;/&gt;

'''Jew-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Weaving women who moved from working for the government to working for Jews, must be restored to the government; Jews may not marry Christian women; Jews may not attempt to convert Christian women;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt;
* Any non-Jewish slave bought by a Jew will be confiscated by the state; if a Jew attempts to circumcise a non-Jewish slave, the slave will be freed and the Jew shall face capital punishment; any Christian slaves owned by a Jew will be taken away and freed;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt;
* A person who is proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism shall have their property confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7&quot;/&gt;

==Reputation==
Constantius II is a particularly difficult figure to judge properly due to the hostility of most sources toward him. A.H.M Jones writes that Constantius &quot;appears in the pages of [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M., ''Later Roman Empire'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kent &amp; M. and A. Hirmer suggest that Constantius &quot;has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54&quot;&gt;Kent, J.P.C., Hirmer, M. &amp; Hirmer, A. ''Roman Coins'' (1978), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to add, &quot;Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54&quot;/&gt; In the military sphere, the campaigns of Constantius and his subordinates on the Rhine and Danube frontiers in the late 350s restored stability to those regions after the troubles caused by Magnentius' revolt.

==Events==
After the revolt of [[Magnentius]], Nepotianus proclaimed himself &quot;emperor&quot; and entered Rome with a band of [[gladiator]]s&lt;ref name =Eutropius/&gt; on 3 June 350.&lt;ref name = DiMaio/&gt; After attempting to resist Nepotianus with an undisciplined force of Roman citizens, the defeated ''[[Praefectus urbi]]'' Titianus (or Anicius, or Anicetus), a supporter of Magnentius, fled the city.

Magnentius quickly dealt with this revolt&lt;ref name =Eutropius/&gt; by sending his trusted ''[[magister officiorum]]'' [[Marcellinus (magister officiorum)|Marcellinus]] to Rome. According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], Nepotianus was killed in the resulting struggle (on 30 June), his head put on a lance and borne around the city.&lt;ref name =Eutropius/&gt; In the following days, his mother Eutropia was also killed, during the persecution of the supporters of Nepotianus, most of whom were [[Roman senator|senators]].

'''Vetranio''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Vetranio Augustus}}; died c. 356), sometimes incorrectly referred to as '''Vetriano''', was a Roman soldier and statesman, a native of the province of [[Moesia]] (in modern [[Serbia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/vetran.htm Roman Empire, Vetranio]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an experienced soldier and officer when he was asked by [[Constantina]], the sister of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantius II]], to proclaim himself [[Caesar (title)#Tetrarchy|Caesar]] (March 1, 350). Her brother [[Constans]] had been killed by [[Magnentius]] earlier that year and she probably thought Vetranio could protect her family and herself against the usurper. Vetranio accepted, and coins were minted in his name, showing the title of [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] (full emperor), rather than Caesar, and the coins indicated that he expected to rule for five years, and hoped for ten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romanumismatics.com/articles/article/siscia-vetranio/ Roma Numismatics: Roman Empire, Vetranio - Not so Loyal After All]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius first seemed to accept the new Emperor and his regalia and sent him money to raise an army. Vetranio frequently asked Constantius for money and military aid to fight Magnentius; he also sent letters to the emperor professing his loyalty to him. When negotiations deadlocked, Magnentius and Vetranio made an alliance; they sent an embassy to the emperor. The ambassadors met with the emperor in [[Heraclea in Thrace]]. Magnentius offered to marry his daughter to Constantius and to marry [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] the emperor's sister, in turn. But first, they required that the emperor lay down his arms and accept the honor as senior emperor. Constantius rejected their offer.

Constantius was on a campaign against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] when Magnentius came to power. Constantius first met with Vetranio at Serdica, and both moved on to [[Naissus]] in Serbia. On 25 December 350 both men mounted a platform before the assembled troops; Constantius managed, by means of a strong speech, to have the soldiers acclaim him emperor. He then took the purple away from Vetranio. The emperor led the old man down the stairs of the platform, called him father, and led him to the dinner table. He was allowed to live the remainder of his years as a private citizen on a state pension in [[Prusa ad Olympum]], [[Bithynia]].

See [[Philostorgius]] 3.22 for detail on his rise to power.

'''Magnentius''' ([[Latin]]: ''Flavius Magnus Magnentius Augustus'' r. 303 – August 11, 353) was a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of the [[Roman Empire]] from 350 to 353.

==Early life and career==

Born in Samarobriva ([[Amiens]]), [[Gaul]], Magnentius was the commander of the [[Jovians and Herculians|Herculians and Jovians]], the Imperial guard units.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ii.58&lt;/ref&gt; When the army grew dissatisfied with the behavior of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constans]], it elevated Magnentius at [[Autun]] on January 18, 350. Constans was abandoned by all except a handful of retainers, and he was slain shortly afterwards by a troop of light [[cavalry]] near the [[Pyrenees]].

==Usurper==
[[File:Double Centenionalis Magnentius-XR-s4017.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
Magnentius quickly attracted the loyalty of the provinces in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Gaul]], and [[Hispania]], in part because he proved to be far more tolerant towards both [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Paganism|Pagans]]. His control on [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] was applied through the election of his men to the most important offices. However, the short-lived revolt of [[Nepotianus]], a member of the [[Constantinian dynasty]], showed Magnentius that his status as emperor was to be consolidated against the members of that dynasty.

Magnentius tried to strengthen his grasp on the territories previously controlled by Constans, moving towards the [[Danube]]. [[Vetranio]], commander of the [[Pannonia]]n army, had been elected [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] by his troops in [[Osijek|Mursa]] on 1 March. This revolt had a loyalist mark, since Vetranio was supported by [[Constantina]], and [[Constantius II]] himself recognized Vetranio, sending him the imperial diadem.

==Demise==

The remaining emperor of the family of [[Constantine I]], Constantius II broke off his war in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] with [[Sassanid dynasty|Persia]], and marched west. Despite Magnentius' efforts to gain Vetranio to his cause, the elderly Vetranio reached Constantius with his army, resigned the crown, and went into retirement in Bithynia.

After electing [[Decentius|Magnus Decentius]] (probably his brother) as [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] and gathering as many troops as possible, Magnentius advanced his armies to meet those of Constantius in the [[Battle of Mursa Major]] in 351; Magnentius led his troops into battle, while Constantius spent the day of battle praying in a nearby church. Despite Magnentius' heroism, his troops were defeated and forced to retreat back to Gaul.

As a result of Magnentius' defeat, Italy ejected his garrisons and rejoined the loyalist cause. Magnentius made a final stand in 353 in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]], after which he committed [[suicide]] by falling on his sword.

Following the suppression of Magnentius' rebellion, Constantius commanded an investigation be made to find his followers. The most notorious agent in this search was the ''[[primicerius notariorum]]'' [[Paulus Catena]] (&quot;Paul the Chain&quot;).

Some sources state that Magnentius' father was a [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] and his mother a [[Franks|Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater pp.131–59. Original sources: Epit. de Caes. 42.7; Zos. HN 2.46.3, 54.1; Zonar. 13.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Justina, later remarried to [[Valentinian I]].

'''Jovian''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Iovianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Jovian's name was inscribed as FLAVIVS IOVIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 331 – 17 February 364) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 363 to 364. Upon the death of emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] during his campaign against the [[Sassanid Empire]], Jovian was hastily declared emperor by his soldiers. He sought peace with the Persians on humiliating terms and reestablished [[Christianity]] as the [[state church of the Roman Empire|state church]]. His reign lasted only eight months.

==Rise to power==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Jovian was born at [[Singidunum]] (today [[Belgrade]] in Serbia) in 331 AD, the son of [[Varronianus]], the commander of [[Constantius II]]'s imperial bodyguards (''comes domesticorum''). He also joined the guards and by 363 had risen to the same command that his father had once held. In this capacity, Jovian accompanied the Roman Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] on the [[Mesopotamia]]n campaign of the same year against [[Shapur II]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king. After a small but decisive engagement the Roman army was forced to retreat from the numerically superior Persian force. Julian, mortally wounded during the retreat, died on 26 June 363. The next day, after the aged [[Salutius|Saturninius Secundus Salutius]], [[praetorian prefect]] of the Orient, had declined the purple, the choice of the army fell upon Jovian. His election caused considerable surprise: [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] suggests that he was wrongly identified with another Jovianus, chief notary (''primicerius notariorum''), whose name also had been put forward, or that during the acclamations the soldiers mistook the name Jovianus for Julianus, and imagined that the latter had recovered from his illness.

==Restoration of Christianity==
Jovian, a [[Christian]], reestablished Christianity as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state church]], ending the brief revival of [[paganism]] under his predecessor. Upon arriving at [[Antioch]], he revoked the edicts of Julian against Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philologic Results&quot;&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.25:1:283.harpers Philologic Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labarum]] of [[Constantine the Great]] again became the standard of the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1530717 Reigns Of Jovian, Valentinian and the Division of the Empire@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He issued an edict of toleration, to the effect that, while the exercise of magical rites would be punished, his subjects should enjoy full liberty of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08529b.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Flavius Claudius Jovianus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 363, however, he issued an edict ordering the Library of Antioch to be burnt down,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael von Albrecht]] and [[Gareth L. Schmeling]], ''A history of Roman literature'' (1997), page 1744&lt;/ref&gt; and another on 11 September subjecting those who worshiped ancestral gods to the death penalty. He extended the same punishment on 23 December to participation in any pagan ceremony (even private ones).&lt;ref&gt;[[:El:Βλάσης Ρασσιάς|Vlasis Rassias]] ''A history of unconditional love'' (2005); currently in publication only in Greek, as ''Μια ιστορία αγάπης''&lt;/ref&gt; Jovian entertained a great regard for [[Athanasius]], whom he reinstated on the archiepiscopal throne,&lt;ref name=&quot;Philologic Results&quot;/&gt; desiring him to draw up a statement of the orthodox faith. In [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature, Jovian became the hero of a Christian romance. From Jovian's reign until the 15th century Christianity remained the dominant religion of both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in 1453.

==Rule==
Jovian continued the retreat begun by Julian. Though harassed by the Persians, the army succeeded in reaching the banks of the [[Tigris]]. There, deep inside Sassanid territory, he was forced to sue for a peace treaty on humiliating terms. In exchange for his safety, he agreed to withdraw from the five [[Roman province]]s east of the Tigris conquered by [[Galerius]] in 298, that [[Diocletian]] had annexed, and to allow the Persians to occupy the fortresses of [[Nisibis]], [[Castra Maurorum]] and [[Singara]]. The Romans also surrendered their interests in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] to the Persians. The Christian king of Armenia, [[Arshak II|Arsaces II (Arshak II)]], was to stay neutral in future conflicts between the two empires and was forced to cede part of his kingdom to Shapur. The treaty was widely seen as a disgrace and Jovian rapidly lost popularity.

After arriving at [[Antioch]], Jovian decided to rush to [[Constantinople]] to consolidate his political position there.  While en route, he was found dead in bed in his tent at [[Dadastana]], halfway between [[Ancyra]] and [[Nicaea]]. His death has been attributed to either a [[Wiktionary:surfeit|surfeit]] of [[mushroom]]s or the poisonous [[carbon monoxide]] fumes of a [[charcoal]] warming fire.

Jovian was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople.

'''Valentinian I''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valentinianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Valentinian's name would read as FLAVIVS VALENTINIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 321 – 17 November 375), also known as '''Valentinian the Great''',&lt;ref&gt;Philip Schaff, ''A Select Library of the Nicene and post Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Volume 3''. Eerdmans Publishing, University of California, 1956. p 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kenneth Rand, ''Founders of the Middle Ages''. Dover Publications, University of Michigan, 1957. p 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Whitby, Mary Whitby, ''Chronicon Paschale 284–628 AD''. Liverpool University Press, University of Michigan, 1989. p 51, 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Dagron, ''Emperor and priest: the imperial office in Byzantium''. Cambridge University Press, 2003. p 26&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Roman emperor]] from 364 to 375. Upon becoming emperor he made his brother [[Valens]] his co-emperor, giving him rule of the eastern provinces while Valentinian retained the west.

During his reign, Valentinian fought successfully against the [[Alamanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Most notable was his victory over the Alamanni in 367 at the [[Battle of Solicinium]]. His brilliant general [[Count Theodosius]] defeated a revolt in [[Roman Africa|Africa]] and the [[Great Conspiracy]], a coordinated assault on [[Roman Britain]] by [[Picts]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], and [[Saxons]]. Valentinian was also the last emperor to conduct campaigns across both the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Valentinian rebuilt and improved the fortifications along the frontiers, even building fortresses in enemy territory.

Due to the successful nature of his reign and the rapid decline of the empire after his death, he is often considered to be the &quot;last great western emperor&quot;. He founded the [[Valentinian Dynasty]], with his sons Gratian and Valentinian II succeeding him in the western half of the empire.

==Early life==
[[File:Solidus de Valentinien MAN.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Solidus of emperor Valentinian I.]]
Valentinian was born in 321&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.6.6&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Cibalae]] in southern [[Pannonia]] (now [[Vinkovci]] in [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenski2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenski|first=Noel Emmanuel|title=Failure of empire: Valens and the Roman state in the fourth century A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvXo39xOV8kC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23332-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinian and his younger brother [[Valens]] were the sons of [[Gratian the Elder|Gratianus Major]], a prominent commander during the reigns of emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Constans I]].&lt;ref name=tomlinp2&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother grew up on the family estate where they were educated in a variety of subjects, including painting and sculpting.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus''. 45.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Gratian the Elder was promoted to ''[[Comes]] Africae'' in the late 320s or early 330s, and the young Valentinian accompanied his father to Africa.&lt;ref name=tomlinp4&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gratian was soon accused of embezzlement and was forced to retire.&lt;ref name=tomlinp4 /&gt; Valentinian joined the army in the late 330s and later probably acquired the position of ''[[protector domesticus]]''.&lt;ref name=tomlinp4 /&gt; Gratian was later recalled during the early 340s and was made ''comes'' of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].&lt;ref name=tomlinp4 /&gt; After holding this post, Gratianus retired to the family estate in Cibalae.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.7.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 350, Constans I was assassinated by agents of the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]], a commander in [[Gaul]] proclaimed emperor by his soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantius II]], older brother of Constans and emperor in the East, promptly set forth towards Magnentius with a large army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus, New History II.60&quot;&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the two emperors met in Pannonia. The ensuing [[Battle of Mursa Major]] resulted in a costly victory for Constantius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.8.5–13&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he defeated Magnentius again in southern Gaul at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.11-2&lt;/ref&gt; Magnentius, now realizing the futility of continuing his revolt, committed suicide in August that year; making Constantius sole ruler of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that Constantius confiscated Gratianus' property, for supposedly showing hospitality to Magnentius when he was in Pannonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Despite his father's fall from favor, Valentinian does not seem to have been adversely affected at this time, making it unlikely he ever fought for the usurper.&lt;ref name=tomlinp13 /&gt; It is known that Valentinian was in the region during the conflict, but what involvement he had in the war, if any, is unknown.&lt;ref name=tomlinp13&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service under Constantius and Julian==
The conflict between Magnentius and Constantius had allowed the [[Alamanni]] and [[Franks]] to take advantage of the confusion and cross the [[Rhine]], attacking several important settlements and fortifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tomlinp4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomlinp13 /&gt; In 355, after deposing his cousin Gallus but still feeling the crises of the empire too much for one emperor to handle, Constantius raised his cousin [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] to the rank of ''Caesar''.&lt;ref name=tomlinp4 /&gt; With the situation in Gaul rapidly deteriorating, Julian was made at least nominal commander of one of the two main armies in Gaul, [[Barbatio]] being commander of the other.&lt;ref name=tomlinp4 /&gt; Constantius devised a strategy where Julian and Barbatio would operate in a pincer movement against the Alamanni.&lt;ref name=tomlinp13 /&gt; However, a band of Alamanni slipped past Julian and Barbatio and attacked [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]). Julian sent the tribunes Valentinian and [[Bainobaudes]] to watch the road the raiders would have to return by. However, their efforts were hindered by Barbatio and his tribune [[Cella (soldier)|Cella]]. The Alamann king [[Chnodomarius]] took advantage of the situation and attacked the Romans in detail, inflicting heavy losses.&lt;ref name=tomlinp13 /&gt; Barbatio complained to Constantius and the debacle was blamed on Valentinian and Bainobaudes, who were cashiered from the army.&lt;ref name=tomlinp13 /&gt;

With his career in ruins, Valentinian returned to his new family estate in [[Sirmium]]. Two years later his first son [[Gratian]] was born by his wife [[Marina Severa]].&lt;ref name=tomlinp14&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinian's actions become uncertain around this time, but he may have been exiled for refusing to do sacrifice to Julian.&lt;ref&gt;Sources give different commands Valentinian held at the time and vastly different places of exile: [[Philostorgius]] says Constantius exiled Valentinian to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sosomen]] to [[Melitene]] in [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia]], the [[Paschal Chronicle]] to [[Selymbria]] in [[Thrace]], and [[Theodoret]] to &quot;a distant fort&quot;. Tomlin, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
At the news of Julian's death on a campaign against the Sassanids, the army hastily declared a commander, [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], emperor. The army still found itself beleaguered by Persian attacks, forcing Jovian to accept humiliating peace terms.&lt;ref name=tomlinp16&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jovian's authority within the empire was still insecure, so he sent a notary [[Procopius (notary)|Procopius]] and the tribune [[Memoridus]] west to announce his accession.&lt;ref name=tomlinp16 /&gt; During Jovian's reign Valentinian was promoted to tribune of a ''Scutarii'' (elite infantry) regiment, and was dispatched to Ancyra. Jovian's rule would be short – only eight months – and before he could even consolidate his position in [[Constantinople]] he died en route between [[Ancyra]] and [[Nicaea]]. His death was attributed to either poisoning or assassination. Jovian is remembered mostly for restoring Christianity to its previous favored status under Constantine and his sons.

The army marched to Nicaea, and a meeting of civil and military officials was convened to choose a new emperor. Two names were proposed: Aequitius, a tribune of the first Scutarii, and Januarius, a relative of Jovian’s in charge of military supplies in Illyricum. Both were rejected; Aequitius as too rough and boorish,&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; Januarius because he was too far away.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; As a man well qualified and at hand, the assembly finally agreed upon Valentinian and sent messengers to inform him in Ancyra.

==Emperor==
Valentinian accepted the acclamation on 26 February 364. As he prepared to make his accession speech the soldiers threatened to riot, apparently uncertain as to where his loyalties lay. Valentinian reassured them that the army was his greatest priority. According to Ammianus the soldiers were astounded by Valentinian’s bold demeanor and his willingness to assume the imperial authority. To further prevent a succession crisis he agreed to pick a co-Augustus. His decision to elect a fellow-emperor could also be construed as a move to appease any opposition among the civilian officials in the eastern portion of the Empire. By agreeing to appoint a co-ruler, he assured the eastern officials that someone with imperial authority would remain in the east to protect their interests.

Valentinian selected his brother Valens as co-Augustus at Constantinople on 28 March 364. This was done over the objections of Dagalaifus, the ''[[magister equitum]]''. Ammianus makes it clear that Valens was subordinate to his brother. The remainder of 364 was spent delegating administrative duties and military commands. Valentinian retained the services of Dagalaifus and promoted Aequitius to ''Comes Illyricum''. Valens was given the [[Prefecture of Oriens]], governed by [[prefect]] [[Salutius]]. Valentinian gained control of [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italy]], [[Prefecture of Gaul|Gaul]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]], and [[Prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Valens resided in Constantinople, while Valentinian’s court was at Milan.

===Campaigns in Gaul and Germania===
[[File:Colosso-de-barletta.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The emperor depicted in the [[Colossus of Barletta]] could very well be Valentinian I.]]
In 365 the [[Alamanni]] crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul. Simultaneously, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] – the last scion of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] – began his revolt against Valens in the east. According to Ammianus, Valentinian received news of both the Alamanni and Procopius' revolt on 1 November while on his way to [[Paris]]. He initially sent Dagalaifus to fight the Alamanni&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.9&lt;/ref&gt; while he himself made preparations to march east and help Valens. After receiving counsel from his court and deputations from the leading Gallic cities begging him to stay and protect Gaul, he decided to remain in Gaul and fight the Alamanni.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.13&lt;/ref&gt;
Valentinian advanced to [[Durocortorum]] and sent two generals, Charietto and Severianus, against the invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; Both generals were promptly defeated and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; In 366, Dagalaifus was sent against the Alamanni but he was also ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the campaigning season Dagalaifus was replaced by Jovinus, a general from the court of Valentinian. After several battles Jovinus pushed the Alamanni out of Gaul and was awarded the consulate the following year for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 367 Valentinian was distracted from launching a punitive expedition against the Alamanni due to crises in Britain and northern Gaul. The Alamanni promptly re-crossed the Rhine and plundered [[Moguntiacum]]. Valentinian succeeded in arranging the assassination of Vithicabius, an Alamannic leader, but Valentinian was more determined to bring the Alamanni under Roman hegemony. Valentinian spent the entire winter of 367 gathering a massive army for a spring offensive. He summoned the ''Comes Italiae'' Sebastianus, with the Italian and Illyrian legions, to join Jovinus and Severus, the ''[[magister peditum]]''. In the spring of 368 Valentinian, his eight-year-old son Gratian and the army crossed the Rhine and [[Main river]] into Alamannic territory. They did not encounter any resistance initially – burning any dwellings or food stores they found along the way. Finally, Valentinian fought the Alamanni in the [[Battle of Solicinium]]; the Romans were victorious&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.15&lt;/ref&gt; but suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.16&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary peace was reached and Valentinian returned to [[Trier]] for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.17&lt;/ref&gt; During 369, Valentinian ordered new defensive works to be constructed and old structures refurbished along the length of the Rhine’s west bank.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; Boldly, he ordered the construction of a fortress across the Rhine in the mountains near modern [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The Alamanni sent envoys to protest, but they were dismissed. The Alamanni attacked the fortress while it was still under construction and destroyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 370 the Saxons renewed their attacks on northern Gaul. Nannienus, the ''comes'' in charge of the troops in northern Gaul, urged Severus to come to his aid. After several modest successes, a truce was called and the Saxons handed over to the Romans young men fit for duty in the Roman military – in exchange for free passage back to their homeland. The Romans ambushed them and destroyed the entire invading force.&lt;ref&gt;Rike, R.L., ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the Res Gestae of Ammianus'' (1987), pg. 91; Jones, Martindale and Morris, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire'' Vol. I (1971), pgs. 615-616&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinian meanwhile tried to persuade the [[Burgundians]] – bitter enemies of the Alamanni – to attack [[Macrian]], a powerful Alamannic chieftain. If the Alamanni tried to flee, Valentinian would be waiting for them with his army. Negotiations with the Burgundians broke down when Valentinian, in his usual high-handed manner, refused to meet with the Burgundian envoys and personally assure them of Roman support. Nevertheless, rumors of a Roman alliance with the Burgundians did have the effect of scattering the Alamanni through fear of an imminent attack from their enemies. This event allowed the ''[[magister equitum]]'' [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius]] to attack the Alamanni through Raetia – taking many Alamannic prisoners. These captured Alamanni were settled in the [[Po river]] valley in Italy, where they were still settled at the time Ammianus wrote his history.

Valentinian campaigned unsuccessfully for four more years to defeat Macrian though in 372 he barely escaped capture by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Valentinian continued to recruit heavily from Alamanni friendly to Rome. He sent the Alamannic king Fraomarius, along with Alamannic troops commanded by Bitheridius and Hortarius, to Britain in order to replenish troops there. Valentinian’s Alamannic campaigns, however, were hampered by troubles first in Africa, and later on the Danube river. In 374 Valentinian was forced to make peace with Macrian because the Emperor's presence was needed to counter an invasion of Illyricum by the Quadi and Sarmatians.

===The Great Conspiracy===
In 367, Valentinian received reports from Britain that a combined force of [[Picts]], [[Attacotti]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] had killed the ''[[Comes litoris Saxonici]]'' [[Nectaridus]] and ''[[Dux Britanniarum]]'' [[Fullofaudes]]. At the same time, Frankish and Saxon forces were raiding the coastal areas of northern Gaul. The empire was in the midst of the [[Great Conspiracy]] – and was in danger of losing control of Britain altogether. Valentinian set out for Britain, sending ''Comes domesticorum'' Severus ahead of him to investigate. Severus was not able to correct the situation and returned to Gaul, meeting Valentinian at [[Samarobriva]]. Valentinian then sent Jovinus to Britain and promoted Severus to magister peditum. It was at this time that Valentinian fell ill and a battle for succession broke out between Severus, a representative of the army, and Rusticus Julianus, ''magister memoriae'' and a representative of the Gallic nobility. Valentinian soon recovered however and appointed his son Gratian as his co-Augustus in the west. Ammianus remarks that such an action was unprecedented. Jovinus quickly returned saying that he needed more men to take care of the situation. In 368 Valentinian appointed Theodosius as the new ''[[Comes Britanniarum]]'' with instructions to return Britain to Roman rule. Meanwhile, Severus and Jovinus were to accompany the emperor on his campaign against the Alamanni.

Theodosius arrived in 368 with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], [[Heruli]], Jovii and Victores legions. Landing at [[Rutupiæ]], he proceeded to [[Londinium]] restoring order to southern Britain. Later, he rallied the remaining garrison which was originally stationed in Britain; it was apparent the units had lost their cohesiveness when Fullofaudes and Nectaridus had been defeated. Theodosius sent for [[Civilis (vicarius)|Civilis]] to be installed as the new [[vicarius]] of the [[diocese]] and [[Dulcitius]] as an additional general.
In 369, Theodosius set about reconquering the areas north of [[London]]; putting down the revolt of [[Valentinus (rebel)|Valentinus]], the brother-in-law of a [[vicarius]] [[Maximinus (praetorian prefect)|Maximinus]]. Subsequently, Theodosius restored the rest of Britain to the empire and rebuilt many fortifications – renaming northern Britain '[[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]'. After his return in 369, Valentinian promoted Theodosius to ''magister equitum'' in place of Jovinus.

===Revolt in Africa and crises on the Danube===
[[File:Missorio di valentiniano I, argento, 364-75 ca., dall'arve, 02.JPG|thumb|right|Silver missorium (heavily worn) believed to depict Valentinian I. The armoured and haloed emperor is flanked by infantry soldiers, he holds a [[labarum]] in one hand and an orb surmounted by a figure of Victory in the other, ca. 364-375]]
In 372, the rebellion of [[Firmus (4th century usurper)|Firmus]] broke out in the still-devastated African provinces. This rebellion was driven by the corruption of the ''comes'' Romanus. Romanus took sides in the murderous disputes among the legitimate and illegitimate children of Nubel, a Moorish prince and leading Roman client in Africa. Resentment of Romanus' peculations and his failure to defend the province from desert nomads caused some of the provincials to revolt. Valentinian                   sent in Theodosius to restore imperial control. Over the following two years Theodosius uncovered Romanus' crimes, arrested him and his supporters, and defeated Firmus.

In 373, hostilities erupted with the [[Quadi]], a group of Germanic-speaking people living on the upper Danube. Like the Alamanni, the Quadi were outraged that Valentinian was building fortifications in their territory. They complained and sent deputations that were ignored by the ''magister armorum per Illyricum'' Aequitius. However, by 373 the construction of these forts was behind schedule. Maximinus, now praetorian prefect of Gaul, arranged with Aequitius to promote his son Marcellianus and put him in charge of finishing the project. The protests of Quadic leaders continued to delay the project, and in a fit of frustration Marcellianus murdered the Quadic king [[Gabinius (king)|Gabinius]] at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful negotiations. This roused the Quadi to war; along with their allies the Sarmatians. During the fall, they crossed the Danube and began ravaging the province of [[Pannonia Valeria]]. The marauders could not penetrate the fortified cities, but they heavily damaged the unprotected countryside. Two legions were sent in but failed to coordinate and were routed by the Sarmatians. Meanwhile, another group of Sarmatians invaded [[Moesia]], but were driven back by the son of Theodosius, ''Dux Moesiae'' and later emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]].

Valentinian did not receive news of these crises until late 374. The following spring he set out from Trier and arrived at [[Carnuntum]], which was deserted. There he was met by Sarmatian envoys who begged forgiveness for their actions. Valentinian replied that he would investigate what had happened and act accordingly. Valentinian ignored Marcellianus’ treacherous actions and decided to punish the Quadi. He was accompanied by Sebastianus and [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]], and spent the summer months preparing for the campaign. In the fall he crossed the Danube at [[Aquincum]] into Quadi territory.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.13&lt;/ref&gt; After pillaging Quadi lands without opposition, he retired to [[Sabaria|Savaria]] to winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death====
In the spring he decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to [[Szony|Brigetio]]. Once he arrived on 17 November, he received a deputation from the Quadi. In return for supplying fresh recruits to the Roman army, the Quadi were to be allowed to leave in peace. However, before the envoys left they were granted an audience with Valentinian. The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by the building of Roman forts in their lands; furthermore individual bands of Quadi were not necessarily bound to the rule of the chiefs who had made treaties with the Romans – and thus might attack the Romans at any time. The attitude of the envoys so enraged Valentinian that he suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at them, provoking his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Edited in Seven Volumes with Introduction, Notes, Appendices, and Index|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108050739|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgtcg0nMg_IC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 17, 375.

== Reputation ==

[[A.H.M. Jones]] writes that although Valentinian I was &quot;less of a boor&quot; than his chief rival for election to the imperial throne, &quot;he was of a violent and brutal temper, and not only uncultivated himself, but hostile to cultivated persons&quot;, as [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] tells us, 'he hated the well-dressed and educated and wealthy and well-born'. He was, however, an able soldier and a conscientious administrator, and took an interest in the welfare of the humbler classes, from which his father had risen. Unfortunately his good intentions were often frustrated by a bad choice of ministers, and an obstinate belief in their merits despite all evidence to the contrary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A.H.M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica 1911]], he was a founder of schools, and provided medical attendance for the poor of [[Rome]], by appointing a physician for each of the fourteen districts of the city.

Valentinian was a [[Christian]] but permitted liberal religious freedom to all his subjects, proscribing only some forms of rituals such as particular types of sacrifices, and banning the practice of magic. Against all abuses, both civil and ecclesiastical (excepting, of course, his own excesses), Valentinian steadily set his face, even against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy. His chief flaw was his temper, which at times was frightful, and showed itself in its full fierceness in the punishment of persons accused of witchcraft, some kinds of fortune-telling or magical practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I,'' Chap. XXV (Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 1952), p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]] gives an interesting account in his Historia Ecclesiastica of Valentinian's marriages, that has inspired some to call this emperor [[Polygamy in Christianity|polygamous]]. According to the text: the empress [[Justina (empress)|Justina]] &quot;became known to [[Marina Severa]], wife of the emperor Valentinian, and had frequent intercourse with the empress, until their intimacy at length grew to such an extent that they were accustomed to bathe together. When Severa saw Justina in the bath she was greatly struck with the beauty of the virgin, and spoke of her to the emperor; saying that the daughter of Justus was so lovely a creature, and possessed of such symmetry of form, that she herself, though a woman, was altogether charmed with her. The emperor, treasuring this description by his wife in his own mind, considered with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa, as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to have two lawful wives. The law was promulgated and he married Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger.&quot; (Book IV, chapt. 31.)&lt;ref&gt;Translated by A.C. Zenos. From Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.)&lt;/ref&gt;
This story is only known to Socrates. There is no trace of any edict allowing polygamy in the laws passed by Valentinian I, his predecessors or his successors. This practice is unknown in all other sources of Classical Antiquity. Valentinian I may have divorced Severa according to Roman Law, which allowed for divorce (see [[Women in Ancient Rome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Frier, Bruce W. and McGinn, Thomas A.J.: A Casebook on Roman Family Law (American Philological Association) OUP USA 2003. Part D, The End of Marriage&lt;/ref&gt; But since divorce was not acknowledged by Christians,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 19, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates contemptuously describes him as a bigamist. It is also possible that Socrates, who was a [[Novatianist]] attempted to accuse Justina, who was an [[Arianist]], of fornication, a common aspersion against other cults. Gibbon maintains that the marriages of Valentinian were conducted successively.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon: The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol.III, p. 66, Cosimo 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Antique sources of [[John Malalas]], the [[Chronicon Paschale]] and [[John of Nikiu]] the empress Severa was banished by Valentinian I for conducting an illegal transaction, before he consorted with Justina. Barnes believes this story to be an attempt to justify the divorce of Valentinian I without accusing the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Barnes, &quot;Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality&quot; (1998), pages 123–125&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valens''' (328&amp;nbsp;– 9 August 378), fully '''Flavius Julius Valens Augustus''' ({{lang-la|{{sc|flavivs ivlivs valens avgvstvs}}}}), was [[Roman Emperor|Eastern Roman Emperor]] from 364 to 378. He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother [[Valentinian I]] after the latter's accession to the throne. Valens, sometimes known as the [[Last of the Romans|Last True Roman]], was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Adrianople]], which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying [[Western Roman Empire]].

==Life==

===Appointment as emperor===
Valens and his brother [[Valentinian I|Valentinian]] were both born in [[Cibalae]] (in present-day [[Croatia]]) into an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] family in 328 and 321 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenski2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenski|first=Noel Emmanuel|title=Failure of empire: Valens and the Roman state in the fourth century A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvXo39xOV8kC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23332-4|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had grown up on estates purchased by their father [[Gratian the Elder]] in Africa and Britain. While Valentinian had enjoyed a successful military career prior to his appointment as emperor, Valens apparently had not. He had spent much of his youth on the family's estate and only joined the army in the 360s, participating with his brother in the Persian campaign of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].

In February 364, reigning Emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], while hastening to [[Constantinople]] to secure his claim to the throne, was [[asphyxiated]] during a stop at [[Dadastana]], 100 miles east of [[Ankara]]. Among Jovian's lieutenants was Valentinian, a ''tribunus scutariorum''. He was proclaimed [[Augustus]] on 26 February, 364. Valentinian felt that he needed help to govern the large and troublesome empire, and, on 28 March of the same year, appointed his brother Valens as co-emperor in the palace of [[Bakırköy|Hebdomon]]. The two ''Augusti'' travelled together through Adrianople and Naissus to [[Sirmium]], where they divided their personnel, and Valentinian went on to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Emmanuel Lenski, ''Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D.'', University of California Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Valens obtained the eastern half of the Empire [[Greece]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Anatolia]] as far east as Persia. Valens was back in his capital of Constantinople by December 364.

===365 Crete earthquake===

In 365, an [[365 Crete earthquake|undersea earthquake]] between magnitudes 8 and 9 near Crete caused a tsunami that hit the coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean.

===Revolt of Procopius===
[[File:157 Procopius.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin issued by [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]].]]

Valens inherited the eastern portion of an empire that had recently retreated from most of its holdings in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] because of a treaty that his predecessor Jovian had made with [[Shapur II]] of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Valens's first priority after the winter of 365 was to move east in hopes of shoring up the situation. By the autumn of 365 he had reached Cappadocian Caesarea when he learned that a usurper, named [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]], had proclaimed himself in Constantinople. When he died, Julian the emperor had left behind one surviving relative, a maternal cousin named [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]]. Procopius had been charged with overseeing a northern division of his relative's army during the Persian expedition and had not been present when Jovian was named his successor. Though Jovian made accommodations to appease this potential claimant, Procopius fell increasingly under suspicion in the first year of Valens' reign.

After narrowly escaping arrest, he went into hiding and reemerged at Constantinople where he was able to convince two military units passing through the capital to proclaim him emperor on 28 September 365. Though his early reception in the city seems to have been lukewarm, Procopius won favor quickly by using propaganda to his advantage: he sealed off the city to outside reports and began spreading rumors that Valentinian had died; he began minting coinage flaunting his connections to the Constantinian dynasty; and he further exploited dynastic claims by using the widow and daughter of [[Constantius II]] to act as showpieces for his regime. This program met with some success, particularly among soldiers loyal to the Constantinians and eastern intellectuals who had already begun to feel persecuted by the Valentinians.

Valens, meanwhile, faltered. When news arrived that Procopius had revolted, Valens considered [[abdication]] and perhaps even [[suicide]]. Even after he steadied his resolve to fight, Valens's efforts to forestall Procopius were hampered by the fact that most of his troops had already crossed the [[Cilicia]]n gates into [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] when he learned of the revolt. Even so, Valens sent two legions to march on Procopius, who easily persuaded them to desert to him. Later that year, Valens himself was nearly captured in a scramble near [[Chalcedon]]. Troubles were exacerbated by the refusal of Valentinian to do any more than protect his own territory from encroachment. The failure of imperial resistance in 365 allowed Procopius to gain control of the dioceses of [[Thrace]] and Asiana by year's end.

Only in the spring of 366 had Valens assembled enough troops to deal with Procopius effectively. Marching out from Ancyra through [[Pessinus]], Valens proceeded into [[Phrygia]] where he defeated Procopius's general Gomoarius at the [[Battle of Thyatira]]. He then met Procopius himself at Nacoleia and convinced his troops to desert him. Procopius was executed on 27 May and his head sent to Valentinian in [[Trier]] for inspection.

===War against the Goths===
The [[Goths|Gothic]] people in the northern region had supported Procopius in his revolt against Valens, and Valens had learned the Goths were planning an uprising of their own. These Goths, more specifically the [[Thervingi]], were at the time under the leadership of [[Athanaric]] and had apparently remained peaceful since their defeat under [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 332. In the spring of 367, Valens crossed the Danube and marched on Athanaric's Goths. These fled into the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and eluded Valens' advance, forcing him to return later that summer. The following spring, a Danube flood prevented Valens from crossing; instead the Emperor occupied his troops with the construction of fortifications. In 369, Valens crossed again, from [[Isaccea|Noviodunum]], and attacked the north-easterly Gothic tribe of Greuthungi before facing Athanaric's Tervingi and defeating them. Athanaric pled for treaty terms and Valens gladly obliged. The treaty seems to have largely cut off relations between Goths and Romans, including [[free trade]] and the exchange of troops for tribute. Valens would feel this loss of military manpower in the following years.

===Conflict with the Sassanids&lt;!--Linked from 'Festus (historian)'--&gt;===
Among Valens' reasons for contracting a hasty and not entirely favorable peace in 369 was the deteriorating state of affairs in the East. Jovian had surrendered Rome's much disputed claim to control over Armenia in 363, and [[Shapur II]] was eager to make good on this new opportunity. The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] ruler began enticing Armenian lords over to his camp and eventually forced the defection of the [[Arshakuni Dynasty|Arsacid]] Armenian king, [[Arshak II|Arsaces II (Arshak II)]], whom he quickly arrested and incarcerated. Shapur then sent an invasion force to seize [[Caucasian Iberia]] and a second to besiege [[Arshak II|Arsaces II's son]], [[Pap of Armenia|Papas (Pap)]], in the fortress of Artogerassa, probably in 367. By the following spring, Papas had engineered his escape from the fortress and flight to Valens, whom he seems to have met at Marcianople while campaigning against the Goths.

Already in the summer following his Gothic settlement, Valens sent his general [[Flavius Arinthaeus|Arinthaeus]] to re-impose Papas on the Armenian throne. This provoked Shapur himself to invade and lay waste to Armenia. Papas, however, once again escaped and was restored a second time under escort of a much larger force in 370. The following spring, larger forces were sent under Terentius to regain Iberia and to garrison Armenia near Mount Npat. When Shapur counterattacked into Armenia in 371, his forces were bested by Valens' generals Trajanus and Vadomarius at Bagavan. Valens had overstepped the 363 treaty and then successfully defended his transgression. A truce settled after the 371 victory held as a quasi-peace for the next five years while Shapur was forced to deal with a [[Kushan]] invasion on his eastern frontier.

Meanwhile, troubles broke out with the boy-king Papas, who began acting in high-handed fashion, even executing the Armenian [[bishop]] [[Narses the Great|Narses]] and demanding control of a number of Roman cities, including [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Pressed by his generals and fearing that Papas would defect to the Persians, Valens made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the prince and later had him executed inside Armenia. In his stead, Valens imposed another Arsacid [[Varazdat|Varasdates (Varazdat)]], who ruled under the regency of the ''[[sparapet]]'' [[Mushegh I Mamikonian]], a friend of Rome.

None of this sat well with the Persians, who began agitating again for compliance with the 363 treaty. As the eastern frontier heated up in 375, Valens began preparations for a major expedition. Meanwhile, trouble was brewing elsewhere. In [[Isauria]], the mountainous region of western [[Cilicia]], a major revolt had broken out in 375 which diverted troops formerly stationed in the East. Furthermore, by 377, the [[Saracens]] under [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mavia]] had broken into revolt and devastated a swath of territory stretching from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] as far as the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Though Valens successfully brought both uprisings under control, the opportunities for action on the eastern frontier were limited by these skirmishes closer to home.

In 375, Valens' older brother Valentinian suffered a burst [[blood vessel]] in his skull while in [[Pannonia]], which resulted in his death on 17 November, 375. [[Gratian]], Valentinian's son and Valens' nephew, had already been associated with his father in the imperial dignity and was joined by his half-brother [[Valentinian II]] who was elevated, on their father's death, to [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] by the imperial troops in [[Pannonia]].

===Gothic War===
{{main|Gothic War (376-382)}}
[[Image:Solidus Valens - transparent background.png|300px|thumb|left|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] minted by Valens in ''c.'' 376. On reverse, Valens and his brother [[Valentinian I]] hold together the [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]], a symbol of power.]]

Valens' plans for an eastern campaign were never realized. A transfer of troops to the Western Empire in 374 had left gaps in Valens' mobile forces. In preparation for an eastern war, Valens initiated an ambitious recruitment program designed to fill those gaps. It was thus not unwelcome news when Valens learned that the Gothic tribes had been displaced from their homeland by an invasion of [[Huns]] in 375 and were seeking asylum from him. In 376, the [[Visigoths]] advanced to the far shores of the lower Danube and sent an ambassador to Valens who had set up his capital in [[Antioch]]. The Goths requested shelter and land in Illyria. An estimated 200,000 Gothic Warriors and altogether 1,000,000 Gothic persons were along the Danube in [[Moesia]] and the ancient land of [[Dacia]].

As Valens' advisers were quick to point out, these Goths could supply troops who would at once swell Valens' ranks and decrease his dependence on provincial troop levies — thereby increasing revenues from the recruitment tax. Among the Goths seeking asylum was a group led by the chieftain [[Fritigern]]. Fritigern had enjoyed contact with Valens in the 370s when Valens supported him in a struggle against Athanaric stemming from Athanaric's persecution of Gothic [[Christians]]. Though a number of Gothic groups apparently requested entry, Valens granted admission only to Fritigern and his followers. This did not, however, prevent others from following.

When Fritigern and his Goths undertook the crossing, Valens's mobile forces were tied down in the east, on the Persian frontier and in Isauria. This meant that only [[limitanei]] units were present to oversee the Goths' settlement. The small number of imperial troops present prevented the Romans from stopping a Danube crossing by a group of Goths and later by Huns and [[Alans]]. What started out as a controlled resettlement mushroomed into a massive influx. And the situation grew worse. When the generals present began abusing the Visigoths under their charge, they revolted in early 377 and defeated the Roman units in [[Thrace]] outside of Marcianople.

After joining forces with the Ostrogoths and eventually the Huns and Alans, the combined barbarian group marched widely before facing an advance force of imperial soldiers sent from both east and west. In a [[Battle of the Willows|battle at ''Ad Salices'']], the Goths were once again victorious, winning free run of Thrace south of the [[Haemus]]. By 378, Valens himself was able to march west from his eastern base in Antioch. He withdrew all but a skeletal force — some of them Goths — from the east and moved west, reaching Constantinople by 30 May, 378. Meanwhile, Valens' councilors, [[Comes]] [[Richomeres]], and his generals Frigerid, Sebastian, and [[Victor (consul 369)|Victor]] cautioned Valens and tried to persuade him to wait for Gratian's arrival with his victorious legionaries from Gaul, something that Gratian himself strenuously advocated. What happened next is an example of [[hubris]], the impact of which was to be felt for years to come. Valens, jealous of his nephew Gratian's success, decided he wanted this victory for himself.

===Battle of Adrianople and death of Valens===
[[File:KHM Wien 32.482 - Valens medal, 375-78 AD.jpg|thumb|left|Medal of Valens, Vienna]]
{{main|Battle of Adrianople}}

After a brief stay aimed at building his troop strength and gaining a toehold in Thrace, Valens moved out to [[Adrianople]]. From there, he marched against the confederated barbarian army on 9 August 378 in what would become known as the [[Battle of Adrianople]]. Although negotiations were attempted, these broke down when a Roman unit sallied forth and carried both sides into battle. The Romans held their own early on but were crushed by the surprise arrival of Visigoth cavalry which split their ranks.

The primary source for the battle is [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historiae'', 31.12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Valens had left a sizeable guard with his baggage and treasures depleting his force. His right wing, cavalry, arrived at the Gothic camp sometime before the left wing arrived. It was a very hot day and the Roman cavalry was engaged without strategic support, wasting its efforts while they suffered in the heat.

Meanwhile Fritigern once again sent an emissary of peace in his continued manipulation of the situation. The resultant delay meant that the Romans present on the field began to succumb to the heat. The army's resources were further diminished when an ill timed attack by the Roman archers made it necessary to recall Valens' emissary, Comes Richomeres. The archers were beaten and retreated in humiliation.

Returning from foraging to find the battle in full swing, Gothic cavalry under the command of Althaeus and Saphrax now struck and, with what was probably the most decisive event of the battle, the Roman cavalry fled. From here, Ammianus gives two accounts of Valens' demise. In the first account, Ammianus states that Valens was &quot;mortally wounded by an arrow, and presently breathed his last breath,&quot; (XXXI.12) His body was never found or given a proper burial. In the second account, Ammianus states the Roman infantry was abandoned, surrounded and cut to pieces. Valens was wounded and carried to a small wooden hut. The hut was surrounded by the Goths who put it to the torch, evidently unaware of the prize within. According to Ammianus, this is how Valens perished (XXXI.13.14-6). A third apocryphal account states that Valens was struck in the face by a Gothic dart and then perished while leading a charge. He wore no helmet to encourage his men. This action turned the tide of the battle which resulted in a tactical victory but a strategic loss.

The church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]] likewise gives two accounts for the death of Valens.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some have asserted that he was burnt to death in a village whither he had retired, which the barbarians assaulted and set on fire. But others affirm that having put off his imperial robe he ran into the midst of the main body of infantry; and that when the cavalry revolted and refused to engage, the infantry were surrounded by the barbarians, and completely destroyed in a body. Among these it is said the Emperor fell, but could not be distinguished, in consequence of his not having on his imperial habit.&lt;ref&gt;The Ecclesiastical History, VI.38, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.vii.xxxviii.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the battle was over, two-thirds of the eastern army lay dead. Many of their best officers had also perished. What was left of the army of Valens was led from the field under the cover of night by Comes Richomer and General Victor.

[[J.B. Bury]], a noted historian of the period, provides specific interpretation on the significance the battle: it was &quot;a disaster and disgrace that need not have occurred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Bury/ieb4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rome, the battle incapacitated the government. Emperor Gratian, nineteen years old, was overcome by the debacle, and until he appointed [[Theodosius I]], unable to deal with the catastrophe which spread out of control.

==Legacy==
[[File:Valens aquädukt02.jpg|thumb|[[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]] in Istanbul (old [[Constantinople]]), capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].]]

&quot;Valens was utterly undistinguished, still only a ''protector'', and possessed no military ability: he betrayed his consciousness of inferiority by his nervous suspicion of plots and savage punishment of alleged traitors,&quot; writes [[A.H.M. Jones]]. But Jones admits that &quot;he was a conscientious administrator, careful of the interests of the humble. Like his brother, he was an earnest Christian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin]], ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; To have died in so inglorious a battle has thus come to be regarded as the nadir of an unfortunate career. This is especially true because of the profound consequences of Valens' defeat. Adrianople spelled the beginning of the end for Roman territorial integrity in the late Empire and this fact was recognized even by contemporaries. Ammianus understood that it was the worst defeat in Roman history since the [[Battle of Cannae]] (31.13.19), and [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] called it &quot;the beginning of evils for the Roman empire then and thereafter.&quot;

Valens is also credited with the commission of a short history of the Roman State. This work, produced by Valens' secretary [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], and known with the name ''Breviarium ab Urbe condita'', tells the story of Rome from its founding. According to some historians, Valens was motivated by the necessity of learning Roman history, that he, the royal family and their appointees might better mix with the Roman Senatorial class.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Breviarium'', ed. H. W. Bird, Liverpool University Press, 1993, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struggles with the religious nature of the Empire===
During his reign, Valens had to confront the theological diversity that was beginning to create division in the Empire. [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (361–363), had tried to revive the pagan religions. His reactionary attempt took advantage of the dissensions between the different factions among the [[Christian]]s and a largely Pagan [[Military history of the Roman Empire|rank and file military]]. However, in spite of broad support, his actions were often viewed as excessive, and before he died in a campaign against the Persians, he was often treated with disdain. His death was considered a sign from [[God]].

Like the brothers [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]], Valens and Valentinian I held divergent theological views. Valens was an [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Valentinian I]] upheld the [[Nicene Creed]]. When Valens died however, the cause of Arianism in the Roman East was to come to an end. His successor [[Theodosius I]] would endorse the Nicene Creed.

'''Procopius of Caesarea''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Προκόπιος ὁ Καισαρεύς}}, {{lang-la|Procopius Caesarensis}}; c.  500 CE – c. 560 CE) was a prominent [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] scholar from ''[[Palaestina Prima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Procopius'', John Moorhead, ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing: M–Z'', Vol. II, Kelly Boyd, (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999), 962;&quot;Like many Byzantine scholars, Procopius affected a remarkable traditional form of writing&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying the Roman general [[Belisarius]] in the wars of the Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], he became the principal historian of the 6th century, writing the ''Wars'' (or ''Histories''), the ''Buildings of Justinian'' and the celebrated (and infamous) ''Secret History''. He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient Western world.

==Life==
Apart from his own writings, the main source for Procopius' life is an entry in the ''[[Suda]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Suda On Line&quot;&gt;[[Suda]] pi.2479. See under 'Procopius' on [http://www.stoa.org/sol/ Suda On Line].&lt;/ref&gt; a 10th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopaedia that tells everything about his early life. He was a native of [[Caesarea]] in the Province ''[[Palaestina Prima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Wars of Justinian'' I.1.1; [[Suda]] pi.2479. See under 'Procopius' on [http://www.stoa.org/sol/ Suda On Line].&lt;/ref&gt; He would have received a conventional élite education in the [[Greece|Greek]] [[classics]] and then [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Averil: ''Procopius and the Sixth Century'', London: Duckworth, 1985, p.7. {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-7156-1510-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at the famous School of Gaza,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, James A. S.: ''Procopius''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1972, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; may have attended law school, possibly at [[Law School of Beirut|Berytus]] (modern [[Beirut]]) or Constantinople,&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, ''Procopius and the Sixth Century'', p. 6. For an alternative reading of Procopius as a trained engineer, see Howard-Johnston, James: 'The Education and Expertise of Procopius'; in ''Antiquité Tardive'' 10 (2002), 19–30.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a ''rhetor'' ([[barrister]] or [[advocate]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Suda On Line&quot;/&gt; He evidently knew Latin, as was natural for a man with legal training.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius uses and translates a number of Latin words in the ''Wars of Justinian''. Börm suggests a possible acquaintance with Vergil and Sallust: Börm, Henning (2007) ''Prokop und die Perser'', p.46. Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart. ISBN 978-3-515-09052-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 527, the first year of [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] Justinian's reign, he became the ''adsessor'' (legal adviser) for [[Belisarius]], Justinian's chief military commander who was then beginning a brilliant career.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius ''Wars of Justinian'' 1.12.24. Procopius speaks of becoming Belisarius' ''symboulos'', 'advisor', in that year.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procopius was with Belisarius on the eastern front until the latter was defeated at the [[Battle of Callinicum]] in 531&lt;ref&gt;''Wars of Justinian'' I.18.1-56&lt;/ref&gt; and recalled to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wars of Justinian'' I.21.2&lt;/ref&gt; Procopius witnessed the [[Nika riots]] of January, 532, which Belisarius and his fellow general [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]] repressed with a massacre in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Procopius ''Wars of Justinian'' I.24.1-58&lt;/ref&gt; In 533, he accompanied Belisarius on his victorious expedition against the [[Vandals|Vandal]] kingdom in [[North Africa]], took part in the capture of [[Carthage]], and remained in Africa with Belisarius' successor [[Solomon (Byzantine general)|Solomon the Eunuch]] when Belisarius returned to Constantinople. Procopius recorded a few of the [[extreme weather events of 535–536]], although these were presented as a backdrop to Roman (Byzantine) military activities, [[Stotzas|such as a mutiny, in and near Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16765/16765-h/16765-h.htm https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16765/16765-h/16765-h.htm] Before modern times, European and Mediterranean historians, as far as weather is concerned, typically recorded only the extreme or major weather events for a year or a multi-year period, preferring to focus on the human activities of policy makers and warriors instead.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined Belisarius for his campaign against the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] kingdom in Italy and experienced the Gothic siege of [[Rome]] that lasted a year and nine days, ending in mid-March 538. He witnessed Belisarius' entry into the Gothic capital, [[Ravenna]], in 540. Book Eight of the ''Wars of Justinian'', and the ''Secret History'', suggest that his relationship with Belisarius seems to have cooled thereafter. When Belisarius was sent back to Italy in 544 to cope with a renewal of the [[Gothic War (535–554)|war with the Goths]], now led by the able king [[Totila]], Procopius appears to have no longer been on Belisarius' staff.

It is not known when Procopius himself died, and many historians ([[James Howard-Johnson]], [[Averil Cameron]], [[Geoffrey Greatrex]]) date his death to 554, but in 562 there was an urban [[prefect]] of Constantinople (''praefectus urbi Constantinopolitanae'') who happened to be called Procopius. In that year, Belisarius was implicated in a conspiracy and was brought before this urban prefect.

==Writings==
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Emperor Justinian]]

The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the Roman emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books of the wars fought by [[Justinian I]], a [[panegyric]] on Justinian's [[public works]] throughout the empire, and a book known as the ''Secret History'' that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his published history.

===''The Wars of Justinian''&lt;!--'History of the Wars' redirects here--&gt;===
Procopius' ''Wars of Justinian'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ὑπὲρ τῶν πολέμων λόγοι}} ''Hypèr tōn polémon lógoi'', {{lang-la|De Bellis}}, &quot;About the Wars&quot;) is clearly his most important work, although it is not as well known as the ''Secret History''. The first seven books, which may have been published as a unit, seem to have been largely completed by 545, but were updated to mid-century before publication, for the latest event mentioned belongs to early 551. The first two books (often known as the ''Persian War'', Latin ''De Bello Persico'') deal with the conflict between the Romans and [[Sassanid Persia]] in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], [[Armenia]], [[Lazica]] and [[Caucasian Iberia]] (roughly modern-day Georgia).&lt;ref&gt;A detailed analysis is provided by Börm, Henning: ''[http://www.academia.edu/1012245/Prokop_und_die_Perser_Untersuchungen_zu_den_romisch-sasanidischen_Kontakten_in_der_ausgehenden_Spatantike_OrOcc_16_._Stuttgart_Franz_Steiner_Verlag_2007 Prokop und die Perser]''. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It details the campaigns of the Sasanian Shah [[Kavadh I]], the [[Nika riots|'Nika' revolt]] in [[Constantinople]] in 532, the war by Kavadh's successor, [[Khosrau I]], in 540 and his destruction of [[Antioch on the Orontes|Antioch]] and the transportation of its inhabitants to Mesopotamia, and the [[Plague of Justinian|great plague]] that devastated Constantinople in 542. They also cover the early career of the Roman general [[Belisarius]], Procopius' patron, in some detail. The next two books, the ''Vandal War'' (Latin ''De Bello Vandalico''), cover Belisarius' [[Vandalic War|successful campaign]] against the [[Vandals|Vandal]] kingdom in [[Africa Province|Roman Africa]]. The remaining books cover the ''Gothic War'' (Latin ''De Bello Gothico''), the campaigns by Belisarius and others to [[Gothic War (535–554)|recapture Italy]], then under the rule of the [[Ostrogoths]]. This includes accounts of the sieges of [[Naples]] and [[Rome]].

Later, Procopius added an eighth book (''Wars VIII'' or ''Gothic War IV''), which brings the history to 552/553, when a Roman army led by the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Narses]] finally destroyed the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]]. This eighth book covers campaigns both in Italy and on the Eastern frontier.

The ''Wars of Justinian'' was influential on later Byzantine history-writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cresci, Lia Raffaella. &quot;Procopio al confine tra due tradizioni storiografiche&quot;. ''Rivista di Filologia e di Istruzione Classica'' 129.1 (2001) 61–77.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuation of Procopius' work was written after his death by the poet and historian [[Agathias|Agathias of Myrina]].

===''Secret History''&lt;!--'Historia Arcana' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 013.jpg|thumb|Belisarius may be this bearded figure on the right of Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale|Church of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]], which celebrates the reconquest of Italy by the [[Byzantine army|Roman army]] under the skillful leadership of Belisarius]]

The famous ''Secret History'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀπόκρυφη Ἱστορία}} ''Apókryphe Istoría'', {{lang-la|Historia Arcana}}) was discovered centuries later in the [[Vatican Library]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/01/03/110103fa_fact_mendelsohn&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Niccolò Alamanni]] in 1623 at [[Lyon]]s. Its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}}, Latin ''Anecdota'', &quot;unpublished writings&quot;). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, or maybe even as late as 562.

The ''Secret History'' reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned with the emperor Justinian and his wife, Empress [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]], as well as Belisarius, his former commander and patron, and [[Antonina (wife of Belisarius)|Antonina]], Belisarius' wife. The anecdotes claim to expose the secret springs of their public actions, as well as the private lives of the emperor, his wife and their entourage. Justinian is portrayed as cruel, venal, prodigal and incompetent; as for Theodora, the reader is treated to the most detailed and titillating portrayals of vulgarity and insatiable lust combined with shrewish and calculating mean-spiritedness.

Among the more titillating (and doubtful) revelations in the ''Secret History'' is Procopius' account of Theodora's thespian accomplishments:

:Often, even in the theatre, in the sight of all the people, she removed her costume and stood nude in their midst, except for a girdle about the groin: not that she was abashed at revealing that, too, to the audience, but because there was a law against appearing altogether naked on the stage, without at least this much of a fig-leaf. Covered thus with a ribbon, she would sink down to the stage floor and recline on her back. Slaves to whom the duty was entrusted would then scatter grains of barley from above into the calyx of this passion flower, whence geese, trained for the purpose, would next pick the grains one by one with their bills and eat.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.html Secret History]'' 9.20–21, trans. Atwater.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband Justinian, meanwhile, was a monster whose head could suddenly vanish—at least according to this passage:

:And some of those who have been with Justinian at the palace late at night, men who were pure of spirit, have thought they saw a strange demoniac form taking his place. One man said that the Emperor suddenly rose from his throne and walked about, and indeed he was never wont to remain sitting for long, and immediately Justinian's head vanished, while the rest of his body seemed to ebb and flow; whereat the beholder stood aghast and fearful, wondering if his eyes were deceiving him. But presently he perceived the vanished head filling out and joining the body again as strangely as it had left it.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.html Secret History]'' 12.20–22, trans. Atwater.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Buildings of Justinian''===
[[File:Sangarius Bridge. Drawing 01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Triumphal arch at the entrance to the [[Sangarius Bridge]]]]

The ''Buildings of Justinian'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ Κτισμάτων}} ''Perì Ktismáton'', {{lang-la|De Aedificiis}}, &quot;On Buildings&quot;) is a [[panegyric]] on Justinian's building activity in the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downey&quot;&gt;Downey, Glanville: &quot;The Composition of Procopius, De Aedificiis&quot;, in ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 78: pp.&amp;nbsp;171&amp;ndash;183; [http://www.jstor.org/pss/283492 abstract] from JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; The first book may date to before the collapse of the first dome of [[Hagia Sophia]] in 557, but some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, Michael: &quot;Procopian Polemics: a review of A. Kaldellis ''Procopius of Caesarea. Tyranny, History, and Philosophy at the End of Antiquity''&quot;, in ''The Classical Review'' 55 (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;648&amp;ndash;&lt;/ref&gt; think that it is possible that the work postdates the building of the [[Sangarius Bridge|bridge over the Sangarius]] in the late 550s. The ''Peri ktismaton'' (or ''De Aedificiis'') tells us nothing further about Belisarius, but it takes a sharply different attitude towards Justinian. He is presented as an idealised [[Christianity|Christian]] emperor who built churches for the glory of [[God]] and defenses for the safety of his subjects and who showed particular concern for the water supply. He built new [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] as well as restoring those that had fallen into disuse.

Historians consider ''Buildings'' to be an incomplete work, due to evidence of the surviving version being a draft with two possible redactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Averil. Procopius and the Sixth Century. London: Routledge, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodora, who was dead when this panegyric was written, is mentioned only briefly, but Procopius' praise of her beauty is fulsome. The [[panegyric]] was likely written at Justinian's behest, however, and it is doubtful that the sentiments expressed are sincere.

Due to the panegyrical nature of the ''The Buildings'', historians have discovered in several occasions discrepancies between claims made by Procopius and other primary sources. A primary example is in Procopius starting the reign of Justinian in 518, which was actually the start of the reign of [[Justin I]], Justinian's predecessor and uncle. This discrepancy can be seen as part of Procopius' panegyric method, as it allowed him to credit buildings constructed under the rule Justin I as Justinian's accomplishments. In this context can be mentioned the renovations to the walls of Edessa after a flood in 525, along with several churches in the region, all of which were completed under Justinian's uncle. Similarly, Procopius falsely credits Justinian for the extensive re-fortifications made in the cities of [[Constanța|Tomis]] and [[Histria (Sinoe)|Histria]] in [[Scythia Minor]], along the Danubian frontier, actual accomplishments of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], predecessor of Justin I.&lt;ref&gt;Croke, Brian and James Crow: &quot;Procopius and Dara&quot;, in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' 73 (1983), 143–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Procopius belongs to the school of [[late antiquity|late antique]] secular historians who continued the traditions of the [[Second Sophistic]]; they wrote in [[Attic dialect|Attic Greek]], their models were [[Herodotus]] and especially [[Thucydides]], and their subject matter was secular history. They avoided vocabulary unknown to Attic Greek and inserted an explanation when they had to use contemporary words. Thus Procopius explains to his readers that ''ekklesia'', meaning a Christian [[Church (building)|church]], is the equivalent of a [[temple]] or [[shrine]] and that [[monk]]s are &quot;the most temperate of Christians ... whom men are accustomed to call monks&quot;. (''Wars'' 2.9.14; 1.7.22) In classical [[Athens]], monks had been unknown and an ''ekklesia'' was the assembly of Athenian citizens that passed the laws.

The secular historians eschewed the history of the Christian church, which they left to ecclesiastical history—a genre that was founded by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. However, [[Averil Cameron]] has argued convincingly that Procopius' works reflect the tensions between the classical and Christian models of history in 6th century [[Byzantium]]. This is supported by [[Mary Whitby]]'s analysis of Procopius' depiction of Constantinople and the [[Hagia Sophia|Church of Hagia Sophia]] in comparison to contemporary pagan panegyrics (''Buildings'', Book I). Procopius can be seen as depicting Justinian as essentially God's [[Vicegerent]], making the case for buildings being a primarily religious panegyric.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, Mary: &quot;Procopius' Buildings Book I: A Panegyrical Perspective&quot;, in ''Antiquité Tardive'' 8 (2000), 45–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procopius indicated (''Secret History'' 26.18) that he planned to write an ecclesiastical history himself and, if he had, he would probably have followed the rules of that genre. But, as far as it is known, the ecclesiastical history remained unwritten.

A number of [[historical novel]]s based on Procopius' works (along with other sources) have been written, one of which, ''[[Count Belisarius]]'', was written by poet and novelist [[Robert Graves]] in 1938. Procopius himself appears as a minor character in [[Felix Dahn]]'s ''[[A Struggle for Rome]]'' and in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s alternate history novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]''. The novel's main character, archaeologist Martin Padway, derives most of his knowledge of historical events from the ''Secret History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lest Darkness Fall|last=de Camp|first=L. Sprague|date=1949|publisher=Ballantine Books|page=111|accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gratian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|eɪ|ʃ|ə|n}}; {{lang-la|Flavius Gratianus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Gratian's name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS GRATIANVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 18 April/23 May 359 – 25 August 383) was [[Roman emperor]] from 375 to 383.
The eldest son of [[Valentinian I]], during his youth Gratian accompanied his father on several campaigns along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] frontiers. Upon the death of Valentinian in 375, Gratian's brother [[Valentinian II]] was declared emperor by his father's soldiers. In 378, Gratian's generals won a decisive victory over the [[Lentienses]], a branch of the [[Alamanni]], at the [[Battle of Argentovaria]]. Gratian subsequently led a campaign across the [[Rhine]], the last emperor to do so, and attacked the Lentienses, forcing the tribe to surrender. That same year, his uncle [[Valens]] was killed in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] against the [[Goths]] – making Gratian essentially ruler of the entire Roman Empire. He favoured [[Christianity]] over [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], refusing the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|divine attributes of the Emperors]] and removing the [[Altar of Victory]] from the [[Roman Senate]].

==Life==
[[Image:158 Gratianus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Emperor Gratian.]]
Gratian was the son of Emperor [[Valentinian I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gratian.htm Roman-emperors.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Marina Severa]], and was born at [[Sirmium]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Hugh James|title=A New General Biographical Dictionary|year=1853|pages=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Gratianus+august+25,+383&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=uERxSMidCY3ssQOEwrkj}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]) in [[Pannonia]].  He was named after his grandfather [[Gratian the Elder]]. Gratian was first married to [[Flavia Maxima Constantia]], daughter of [[Constantius II]]. His second wife was [[Laeta]]. Both marriages remained childless. His stepmother was Empress [[Justina (empress)|Justina]] and his paternal half siblings were Emperor [[Valentinian II]], [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]] and Justa.

On 24 August 367 he received from his father the title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augustus]]''. On the death of Valentinian (17 November 375), the troops in Pannonia proclaimed his infant son (by a second wife Justina) emperor under the title of [[Valentinian II]].

Gratian acquiesced in their choice; reserving for himself the administration of the [[Gauls|Gallic]] [[Roman province|provinces]], he handed over [[Italy]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and [[Africa (province)|Africa]] to Valentinian and his mother, who fixed their residence at [[Mediolanum]]. The division, however, was merely nominal, and the real authority remained in the hands of Gratian.

Gratian's general [[Mallobaudes]], a king of the [[Franks]], and [[Naniemus]], completely defeated the [[Lentienses]], the southernmost branch of the [[Alamanni]], in May 378 at the [[Battle of Argentovaria]]. Upon receiving news of the victory, Gratian personally led a campaign across the Upper Rhine into the territory of the Lentienses. After initial trouble facing the Lentienses on high ground, Gratian blockaded the enemy instead and received their surrender. The Lentienses were forced to supply young men to be levied into the Roman army, while the remainder were allowed to return home. Later that year, Valens met his death in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] on 9 August. Valens refused to wait for Gratian and his army to arrive and assist in defeating the host of [[Goths]], [[Alans]] and [[Huns]]; as a result, two-thirds of the eastern Roman army were killed as well.

In the same year, the government of the Eastern Empire devolved upon Gratian, but feeling himself unable to resist unaided the incursions of the barbarians, he promoted [[Theodosius I]]  on 19 January 379 to govern that portion of the Empire. Gratianus and Theodosius then cleared the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] of [[barbarian]]s in the [[Gothic War (376-382)]].

For some years Gratian governed the Empire with energy and success but gradually sank into indolence, occupying himself chiefly with the pleasures of the chase, and became a tool in the hands of the [[Franks|Frankish]] general [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]] and bishop [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] of [[Milan]].

By taking into his personal service a body of Alans, and appearing in public in the dress of a [[Scythian]] warrior, after the disaster of the Battle of Adrianople, he aroused the contempt and resentment of his [[Roman military history|Roman troops]]. A Roman general named [[Magnus Maximus]] took advantage of this feeling to raise the standard of revolt in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and invaded [[Gaul]] with a large army. Gratian, who was then in [[Paris]], being deserted by his troops, fled to [[Lyon]]. There, through the treachery of the governor, Gratian was delivered over to one of the rebel generals, [[Andragathius]], and assassinated on 25 August 383.

==Empire and Orthodox Christianity==
The reign of Gratian forms an important epoch in ecclesiastical history, since during that period [[Nicene Christianity]] for the first time became dominant throughout the empire.

Gratian also published an edict that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith). The move was mainly thrust at the various beliefs that had arisen out of [[Arianism]], but smaller dissident sects, such as the [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonians]], were also prohibited.

===Suppression of paganism===
&lt;!--
Upon the death of his father ([[Valentinian]]) in the year 375, [[Gratian]] began his actual reign at the age of sixteen. Six days after the death of Valentinian I, Gratian's half brother, [[Valentinian II]], who was only four years old, was also declared emperor. After the death of [[Valens]], at the battle of [[Adrianople]] in 378, Gratian chose a Spaniard named [[Theodosius I]] to succeed his uncle. Gratian had been educated by [[Ausonius]] who had praised his pupil for his tolerance.
--&gt;
Gratian, under the influence of his chief advisor the Bishop of Milan [[Ambrose]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06729c.htm &quot;Gratian&quot;, Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Letter of Gratian to Ambrose&quot;, The Letters of Ambrose Bishop of Milan, 379AD.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_01_letters01_10.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; took active steps to repress [[pagan worship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsey&quot;&gt;R. MacMullen, &quot;Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.100–400, Yale University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-300-03642-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 2.8.18–2.8.25, 16.7.1–16.7.5&lt;/ref&gt; This brought to an end a period of widespread, if unofficial, religious tolerance that had existed since the time of Julian.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus (4.35) indicated that change occurred in Gratian's character when he fell under the influence of evil courtiers.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;''In the long truce between the hostile camps''&quot;, writes historian Samuel Dill &quot;''the pagan, the sceptic, even the formal, the lukewarm Christian, may have come to dream of a mutual toleration which would leave the ancient forms undisturbed but such men, living in a world of literary and antiquarian illusions, know little of the inner forces of the new Christian movement.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kirsch, &quot;God Against the Gods&quot;, Viking Compass, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Dill, Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire&quot;, 2d rev ed. , Meridian New York, 1958, p26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382, Gratian appropriated the income of the Pagan priests and [[Vestal Virgins]], forbade legacies of real property to them and abolished other privileges belonging to the Vestals and to the pontiffs. He confiscated the personal possessions of the colleges of Pagan priests, which also lost all their privileges and immunities. Gratian declared that all of the Pagan temples and shrines were to be confiscated by the government and that their revenues were to be joined to the property of the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.20; Symmachus Relationes 1–3; Ambrose Epistles 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

He ordered another removal of the [[Altar of Victory]] from the [[Roman Senate|Senate House]] at Rome, despite protests of the pagan members of the Senate, and confiscated its revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, J.J., &quot;The Altar of Victory – Paganism's Last Battle.&quot; L'Antiquite Classique 35 (1966): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Epistles 17–18; Symmachus Relationes 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan Senators responded by sending an appeal to Gratian, reminding him that he was still the [[Pontifex Maximus]] and that it was his duty to see that the ancestral Pagan rites were properly performed. They appealed to Gratian to restore the Altar of Victory and the rights and privileges of the Vestal Virgins and priestly colleges. Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, did not grant an audience to the Pagan Senators. Moreover, he further renounced the title,  office, and insignia of the ''Pontifex Maximus.''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. 
Notwithstanding his actions, Gratian was still [[apotheosis#Roman|deified]] after his death.

'''Flavius Valentinianus''' (371 – 15 May 392), commonly known as '''Valentinian II''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 375 to 392.

==Early life and accession (371–375)==
Flavius Valentinianus was born to Emperor [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife, [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]. He was the half-brother of Valentinian’s other son, [[Gratian]], who had shared the imperial title with his father since 367. He had three sisters [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]], Grata and Justa. The elder Valentinian died on campaign in Pannonia in 375. Neither Gratian (then in [[Trier]]) nor his uncle Valens (emperor for the East) were consulted by the army commanders on the scene. Instead of merely acknowledging Gratian as his father’s successor, Valentinian I’s generals acclaimed the four-year-old Valentinian [[Augustus (honorific)|''augustus'']] on 22 November 375. The army, and its Frankish general [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]], may have been uneasy about Gratian's lack of military ability, and so raised a boy who would not immediately aspire to military command.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/valenii.htm |title = Valentinian II |publisher = Roman emperors}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Curran |1998 |p = 86}}

==Reign from Milan (375–387)==
Gratian, forced to accommodate the generals who supported his half-brother, governed the trans-alpine provinces (including [[Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Roman Britain|Britain]]), while [[Italy]], part of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], and [[Africa Province|Africa]] were under the rule of Valentinian. In 378, their uncle, the Emperor [[Valens]], was killed in battle with the [[Goths]] at [[Battle of Adrianople|Adrianople]], and Gratian invited the general [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] to be emperor in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]]. As a child, Valentinian II was under the influence of his [[Arianism|Arian]] mother, the Empress Justina, and the imperial court at [[Milan]], an influence contested by the [[Catholic]] [[bishop]] of Milan, [[Ambrose]].

Justina used her influence over her young son to oppose the Nicean party which was championed by Ambrose. In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused an imperial request to hand over the [[Portian basilica]] for the use of Arian troops. In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop Auxentius, and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.{{Sfn |Curran |1998 |p = 106}}  [[Magnus Maximus]] used the emperor’s heterodoxy against him, and even his eventual protector, Theodosius, cast aspersions on his Arianism. Valentinian also tried to restrain the despoiling of pagan temples in [[Rome]]. Buoyed by this instruction, the pagan [[Roman Senate|senators]], led by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Aurelius Symmachus]], the [[Praefectus urbi|Prefect of Rome]], petitioned in 384 for the restoration of the [[Altar of Victory]] in the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]], which had been removed by Gratian in 382. Valentinian, at the insistence of Ambrose, refused the request and, in so doing, rejected the traditions and rituals of pagan Rome to which Symmachus had appealed.

In 383, Magnus Maximus, commander of the armies in Britain, declared himself Emperor and established himself in Gaul and Hispania.  Gratian died while fleeing him.  For a time the court of Valentinian, through the mediation of Ambrose, came to an accommodation with the usurper, and Theodosius recognized Maximus as co-emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire|West]]. In 386 or 387, Maximus crossed the [[Alps]] into the [[Po River|Po]] valley and threatened Milan. Valentinian II and Justina fled to Theodosius in [[Thessalonica]].  The latter came to an agreement, cemented by his marriage to Valentinian’s sister [[Galla (wife of Theodosius)|Galla]], to restore the young emperor in the West.  In 388, Theodosius marched west and defeated Maximus. Although he was to appoint both of his sons emperor ([[Arcadius]] in 383, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 393), Theodosius remained loyal to the dynasty of Valentinian I.

==Reign from Vienne (388–392)==
[[Image:Solidus Valentinian II trier RIC 090a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] minted by Valentinian II. On the reverse, both Valentinian and [[Theodosius I]] are celebrated as victorious.]]
After the defeat of Maximus, Theodosius remained in Milan until 391. Valentinian took no part in Theodosius's [[Roman triumph|triumphal celebrations]] over Maximus. Valentinian and his court were installed at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] in Gaul, while Theodosius appointed key administrators in the West and had coins minted, which implied his guardianship over the 17-year-old.{{Sfn |Croke |1976 |pp = 235f}}  Justina had already died, and Vienne was far away from the influence of Ambrose. Theodosius's trusted general, the [[Franks|Frank]] [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], was appointed [[magister militum]] for the Western provinces (bar Africa) and guardian of Valentinian. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1 = S |last1 = Williams |first2 = G |last2 = Friell |title = Theodosius: the Empire at Bay |place = Routledge |year = 1994 |page = 126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the general campaigned successfully on the Rhine, the young emperor remained at Vienne, in contrast to his warrior father and his older brother, who had campaigned at his age. Arbogast's domination over the emperor was considerable, and the general even murdered [[Harmonius]], a friend of Valentinian suspected of taking bribes, in the emperor's presence.{{Sfn |Croke |1976 |p = 237}}

The crisis reached a peak when Arbogast prohibited the emperor from leading the Gallic armies into Italy to oppose a barbarian threat. Valentinian, in response, formally dismissed Arbogast. The latter ignored the order, publicly tearing it up and arguing that Valentinian had not appointed him in the first place. The reality of where the power lay was openly displayed. Valentinian wrote to Theodosius and Ambrose complaining of his subordination to his general. In explicit rejection of his earlier Arianism, he invited Ambrose to come to Vienne to [[baptism|baptize]] him.

On 15 May 392, Valentinian was found hanged in his residence in Vienne. Arbogast maintained that the emperor’s death was suicide. [[Zosimus]] writing in the early sixth century from Constantinople, states that the Frank had Valentinian murdered,&lt;ref&gt;''Historia nova'', IV. 53 which relies heavily on the history by the pagan [[Eunapius]]&lt;/ref&gt; ancient authorities are divided in their opinion.{{Sfn |Croke |1976}}{{Rp |needed = yes |date = August 2012}} Ambrose's eulogy is the only contemporary Western source for Valentinian's death.&lt;ref&gt;''De obitu Valentiniani consolatio''&lt;/ref&gt; It is ambiguous on the question of the emperor's death, which is not surprising, as Ambrose represents him as a model of Christian virtue. Suicide, not murder, would make the bishop dissemble on this key question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |others = JHWG Liebeschuetz, tr |first = Ambrose |last = of Milan |title = Political Letters and Speeches |publisher = Liverpool University Press |year = 2005 |page = 359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man’s body was conveyed in ceremony to Milan for burial by Ambrose, mourned by his sisters Justa and Grata. He was laid in a [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] next to his brother Gratian, most probably in the Chapel of Sant'Aquilino attached to [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan#Chapel of Saint Aquilino|San Lorenzo]].{{Refn |group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; |The bottom of the sarcophagus may be identical to a porphyry tub (''labrum'') now in the Duomo of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first = Mark J |last = Johnson |title = On the Burial Places of the Valentinian Dynasty |journal = Historia |volume = 40 |issue = 4 |year = 1991 |pages = 501–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At first Arbogast recognized Theodosius's son Arcadius as emperor in the West, seemingly surprised by his charge's death.{{Sfn |Croke |1976 |p = 244}}  After three months, during which he had no communication from Theodosius, Arbogast selected an imperial official, [[Eugenius]], as emperor. Theodosius initially tolerated this regime but, in January 393, elevated the eight-year-old Honorius as ''augustus'' to succeed Valentinian II. Civil war ensued and, in 394, Theodosius defeated Eugenius and Arbogast.

==Significance==
Valentinian himself seems to have exercised no real authority, and was a figurehead for various powerful interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. Since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the empire had been ruled by powerful generals, a situation formalised by [[Diocletian]] and his collegiate system. While [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and his sons had been strong military figures, they had also re-established the practice of hereditary succession, adopted by Valentinian I. The obvious flaw in these two competing requirements came in the reign of Valentinian II, a child.&lt;ref&gt;Williams &amp; Friell, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when children or nonentities, reigning as emperors, were controlled by powerful generals and officials.

'''Theodosius I''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Theodosius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Theodosius' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS THEODOSIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt; 11 January 347&amp;nbsp;–  17 January 395), also known as '''Theodosius the Great''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern]] and the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against [[Goths]] and other barbarians who had invaded the Empire; he failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic War]] they established a homeland south of the [[Danube]], in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers [[Magnus Maximus]] and [[Eugenius]] at great cost to the power of the Empire.

He also issued decrees that effectively made orthodox [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] [[Christianity]] the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cf. decree, infra''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdictOfThessolonica&quot;&gt;&quot;Edict of Thessolonica&quot;: See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; He neither prevented nor punished the destruction of prominent [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic]] temples of classical antiquity, including the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]] and the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]]. He dissolved the order of the [[Vestal Virgins]] in [[Rome]]. In 393, he banned the pagan rituals of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympics in Ancient Greece]]. (It was not until the end of the 19th century, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], that [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] were held again.) After his death, Theodosius' young sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] inherited the East and West halves respectively, and the Roman Empire was never again re-united, though Byzantine Emperors after [[Zeno_(emperor)|Zeno]] would claim the united title after [[Julius Nepos]]' death in 480 AD. 

==Career==
Theodosius was born in [[Coca, Segovia|Cauca]], [[Gallaecia]], [[Hispania]] (according to [[Hydatius]] and [[Zosimus]])&lt;ref&gt;Hydatius ''Chronicon'', year 379, II&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Italica]], [[Baetica]], [[Hispania]] (according to [[Marcellinus Comes]], writing later), to a senior military officer, [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus|Zos.]] ''Historia Nova'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=FSMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=zosimus&amp;ei=xzm1R-euDJ6SzQT309jGBQ#PPA200,M1 4.24.4].&lt;/ref&gt;  Theodosius learned his military lessons by campaigning with his father's staff in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] where he went to help quell the [[Great Conspiracy]] in 368.

In about 373 he became governor of Upper Moesia and oversaw hostilities against the Sarmatians and thereafter against the Alemanni.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/collapse/theodosius-I.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He was military commander (''[[dux]]'') of [[Moesia]], a Roman province on the lower [[Danube]], in 374. However, shortly thereafter, and at about the same time as the sudden disgrace and execution of his father, Theodosius retired to Hispania. The reason for his retirement, and the relationship (if any) between it and his father's death is unclear. It is possible that he was dismissed from his command by the emperor [[Valentinian I]] after the loss of two of Theodosius' legions to the [[Sarmatians]] in late 374.

The death of Valentinian I in 375 created political pandemonium. Fearing further persecution on account of his family ties, Theodosius abruptly retired to his family estates in the province of [[Gallaecia]] (present day [[Galicia, Spain]] and [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern Portugal]]) where he adopted to the life of a provincial aristocrat.

From 364 to 375, the Roman Empire was governed by two co-emperors, the brothers [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]]; when Valentinian died in 375, his sons, [[Valentinian II]] and [[Gratian]], succeeded him as rulers of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In 378, after the disastrous [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] where [[Valens]] was killed, Gratian invited Theodosius to take command of the Illyrian army. As [[Valens]] had no successor, Gratian's appointment of Theodosius amounted to a ''de facto'' invitation for Theodosius to become ''co-Augustus'' of the [[East Roman Empire]]. After Gratian was killed in a rebellion in 383, Theodosius appointed his own elder son, [[Arcadius]], to be his co-ruler in the East. After the death in 392 of Valentinian II, whom Theodosius had supported against a variety of usurpations, Theodosius ruled as sole Emperor, appointing his younger son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] Augustus as his co-ruler of the West ([[Milan]], on 23 January 393) and by defeating the usurper [[Eugenius]] on 6 September 394, at the [[Battle of the Frigidus]] ([[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] river, modern [[Slovenia]]) he restored peace.

==Family==
By his first wife, the probably Spanish [[Aelia Flaccilla]] Augusta, he had two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and a daughter, Aelia [[Pulcheria (daughter of Theodosius I)|Pulcheria]]; Arcadius was his heir in the East and Honorius in the West. Both Aelia Flaccilla and Pulcheria died in 385.

His second wife (but never declared ''Augusta'') was [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]], daughter of the emperor [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]. Theodosius and Galla had a son Gratian, born in 388 and who died young, and a daughter Aelia [[Galla Placidia]] (392–450). Placidia was the only child who survived to adulthood and later became an Empress.

==Diplomatic policy with the Goths==
The [[Goths]] and their allies ([[Vandals|Vandali]], [[Taifals|Taifalae]], [[Bastarnae]] and the native [[Carpians|Carpi]]) entrenched in the [[province]]s of [[Dacia]] and eastern [[Pannonia|Pannonia Inferior]] consumed Theodosius' attention. The Gothic crisis was so dire that his co-Emperor Gratian relinquished control of the [[Illyria]]n provinces and retired to [[Trier]] in [[Gaul]] to let Theodosius operate without hindrance. A major weakness in the Roman position after the [[Battle of Adrianople|defeat at Adrianople]] was the recruiting of [[barbarian]]s to fight against other barbarians. In order to reconstruct the Roman Army of the West, Theodosius needed to find able bodied soldiers and so he turned to the most capable men readily at hand: the barbarians recently settled in the Empire. This caused many difficulties in the battle against barbarians since the newly recruited fighters had little or no loyalty to Theodosius.

Theodosius was reduced to the costly expedient of shipping his recruits to [[Egypt]] and replacing them with more seasoned Romans, but there were still switches of allegiance that resulted in military setbacks. Gratian sent generals to clear the [[diocese]]s of Illyria ([[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]) of Goths, and Theodosius was able finally to enter [[Constantinople]] on  24 November 380, after two seasons in the field. The final treaties with the remaining Gothic forces, signed 3 October 382, permitted large contingents of barbarians, primarily [[Thervingi]]an Goths, to settle south of the [[Danube]] frontier and largely govern themselves.

The Goths now settled within the Empire had, as a result of the treaties, military obligations to fight for the Romans as a national contingent, as opposed to being fully integrated into the Roman forces.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Goths would serve in Roman legions and others, as ''[[foederati]],'' for a single campaign, while bands of Goths switching loyalties became a destabilizing factor in the internal struggles for control of the Empire.

In 390 the population of Thessalonica rioted in complaint against the presence of the local Gothic garrison. The [[Magister militum|garrison commander]] was killed in the violence, so [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|Theodosius ordered the Goths to kill all the spectators in the circus as retaliation]]; [[Theodoret]], a contemporary witness to these events, reports:
{{quote|&quot;... the anger of the Emperor rose to the highest pitch, and he gratified his vindictive desire for vengeance by unsheathing the sword most unjustly and tyrannically against all, slaying the innocent and guilty alike. It is said seven thousand perished without any forms of law, and without even having judicial sentence passed upon them; but that, like ears of wheat in the time of harvest, they were alike cut down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, ''Ecclesiastical History''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Theodosius was [[Excommunication#Roman Catholic Church|excommunicated]] by the bishop of Milan, [[Saint Ambrose]] for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;&gt;Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints''. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. ISBN 0-14-051312-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&amp;nbsp;— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance.

In the last years of Theodosius' reign, one of the emerging leaders of the Goths, named [[Alaric I|Alaric]], participated in Theodosius' campaign against [[Eugenius]] in 394, only to resume his rebellious behavior against Theodosius' son and eastern successor, [[Arcadius]], shortly after Theodosius' death.

==Civil wars in the Empire==
[[File:Roman empire 395.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The administrative divisions of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395, under Theodosius I.]]
After the death of [[Gratian]] in 383, Theodosius' interests turned to the [[Western Roman Empire]], where the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] had taken all the provinces of the West except for Italy. This self-proclaimed threat was hostile to Theodosius' interests, since the reigning emperor [[Valentinian II]], Maximus' enemy, was Theodosius' ally. Theodosius, however, was unable to do much about Maximus due to his still inadequate military capability and he was forced to keep his attention on local matters. Maximus hoped to share the Empire with Theodosius, but when Maximus began an invasion of Italy in 387, Theodosius felt compelled to take action. Both sides raised large armies which included many barbarians.

The armies of Theodosius and Maximus fought at the [[Battle of the Save]] in 388, which saw Maximus defeated. On 28 August 388 Maximus was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Now the ''de facto'' ruler of the Western empire as well, Theodosius celebrated his victory in Rome on June 13 389 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.livius.org/person/theodosius-i/&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed in [[Milan]] until 391, installing his own loyalists in senior positions including the new ''[[magister militum]]'' of the West, the Frankish general [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]]. Valentinian II was a very young man, little more than a figurehead, with Arbogast as the true power behind the throne.

Trouble arose again, after Valentinian quarreled publicly with Arbogast, and was found hanging in his room. Arbogast announced that this had been a suicide. Arbogast, unable to assume the role of Emperor because of his non-Roman background, elected [[Eugenius]], a former teacher of rhetoric. Eugenius made some limited concessions to the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]; like Maximus he sought Theodosius' recognition in vain. In January 393, Theodosius gave his son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] the full rank of &quot;Augustus&quot; in the West, citing Eugenius' illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodosius gathered a large army, including Goths and other barbarians, and marched against Eugenius. The two armies faced at the [[Battle of Frigidus]] in September 394.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle began on 5 September 394, with Theodosius' full frontal assault on Eugenius' forces.  Theodosius was repulsed on the first day, and Eugenius thought the battle to be all but over. However, in Theodosius' camp, the loss of the day decreased morale. It is said that Theodosius was visited by two &quot;heavenly riders all in white&quot; who gave him courage. The next day, the battle began again and Theodosius' forces were aided by a natural phenomenon known as the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]], which produces cyclonic winds. The Bora blew directly against the forces of Eugenius and disrupted the line.

Eugenius' camp was stormed; Arbogast committed suicide and Eugenius was captured and soon after executed. Thus Theodosius became sole Emperor.

==Art patronage==
[[File:Theodosius colum, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Theodosius offers a [[laurel wreath]] to the victor, on the marble base of the Obelisk of [[Thutmosis III]] at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]].]]
Theodosius oversaw the removal in 390 of an Egyptian [[obelisk]] from Alexandria to Constantinople.  It is now known as the [[obelisk of Theodosius]] and still stands in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], the long [[racetrack]] that was the center of Constantinople's public life and scene of political turmoil. Re-erecting the monolith was a challenge for the technology that had been honed in the construction of [[siege engine]]s. The obelisk, still recognizably a [[Helios|solar symbol]], had been moved from [[Karnak]] to [[Alexandria]] with what is now the [[obelisks in rome|Lateran obelisk]] by [[Constantius II]].

The Lateran obelisk was shipped to Rome soon afterwards, but the other one then spent a generation lying at the docks due to the difficulty involved in attempting to ship it to Constantinople. Eventually, the obelisk was cracked in transit. The white [[marble]] base is entirely covered with [[bas-relief]]s documenting the Imperial household and the engineering feat of removing it to Constantinople. Theodosius and the Imperial family are separated from the nobles among the spectators in the [[Imperial box]], with a cover over them as a mark of their status. The naturalism of traditional Roman art in such scenes gave way in these reliefs to [[conceptual art]]: the ''idea'' of order, decorum and respective ranking, expressed in serried ranks of faces. This is seen as evidence of formal themes beginning to oust the transitory details of mundane life, celebrated in [[Hellenistic religion|Roman]] [[portrait]]ure.

The ''Forum Tauri'' in Constantinople was renamed and redecorated as the [[Forum of Theodosius]], including a [[column of Theodosius|column]] and a [[triumphal arch]] in his honour.

==Nicene Christianity becomes the state religion==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[First Council of Constantinople]] --&gt;
In 325, [[Constantine I]] had facilitated the Church's bishops to convene the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], which affirmed the prevailing view that Jesus, the Son, was equal to the Father, one with the Father, and of the same substance (''[[Homoousian|homoousios]]'' in Greek). The council condemned the teachings of the heterodox theologian [[Arius]]: that the Son was a created being and inferior to God the Father. Despite the council's ruling, controversy continued. By the time of Theodosius' accession, there were still several different Church factions that promoted alternative [[Christology]].

===Arians===
While the Nicene council paved the way for the homoousian view, there remained many closer to the [[Arius|Arian]] school who attempted to bypass the Christological debate by saying that Jesus was merely like (''homoios'' in Greek) God the Father, without speaking of substance (''ousia''). These non-Nicenes were frequently labeled as [[Arians]] (i.e., followers of Arius) by their opponents, though not all would necessarily have identified themselves as such.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, Noel, ''Failure of Empire'', University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0-520-23332-8, pp235–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor Valens had favored the group who used the ''homoios'' formula; this [[theology]] was prominent in much of the East and had under Constantius II gained a foothold in the West. Theodosius, on the other hand, steadfastly held to the [[Nicene Creed]] which was the interpretation that predominated in the West and was held by the important [[Church of Alexandria|Alexandrian church]].

===Definition of orthodoxy and de-legitimation of non-orthodox Christian creeds===
On 27 February 380, together with [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]], Theodosius issued the decree &quot;''Cunctos populos''&quot;, the so-called &quot;[[Edict of Thessalonica]]&quot;, recorded in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] [[:la:s:Codex Theodosianus - Liber XVI#I.2|xvi.1.2]]. This declared the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity to be the only legitimate Imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself [[Catholic]]. Other Christians he described as &quot;foolish madmen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2, Medieval Sourcebook:  Banning of Other Religions]&lt;/ref&gt; He also ended official state support for the traditional [[Polytheism]] religions and customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaylorPhillips2012&quot;&gt;{{citation|author1=Noel Harold Kaylor|author2=Philip Edward Phillips|title=A Companion to Boethius in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_secKlFKB0C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=3 May 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-18354-4|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  26 November 380, two days after he had arrived in Constantinople, Theodosius expelled the non-Nicene bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and appointed [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] patriarch of Antioch, and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], one of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] from [[Antioch]] (today in Turkey), patriarch of Constantinople. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In May 381, Theodosius summoned a new ecumenical council at Constantinople (see [[First Council of Constantinople]]) to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicene orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p54.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The council went on to define orthodoxy, including the mysterious Third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who, though equal to the Father, 'proceeded' from Him, whereas the Son was 'begotten' of Him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p55&quot;&gt;William and Friell, p55.&lt;/ref&gt; The council also &quot;condemned the Apollonarian and Macedonian heresies, clarified jurisdictions of the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] according to the civil boundaries of dioceses and ruled that Constantinople was second in precedence to Rome.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p55&quot; /&gt;  The [[Battle of Adrianople#Course of battle|death of Valens]], the Arians' protector, probably damaged the standing of the Homoian faction.

===Proscription of Hellenistic religion===
{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I}}
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|left|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]
The Christian persecution of [[Hellenistic religion|Roman religion]] under Theodosius I began in 381, after the first couple of years of his reign in the Eastern Empire. In the 380s, Theodosius I reiterated Constantine's ban on former customs of [[Hellenistic religion|Roman religion]], prohibited [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]], pioneered the criminalization of Magistrates who did not enforce laws against [[polytheism]], broke up some [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] associations and tolerated attacks on [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] temples.

Between 389–392 he promulgated the &quot;Theodosian decrees&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMeyer1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=N Lewis|author2=Reinhold Meyer|title=Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G07okHErcacC&amp;pg=PA614|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07133-8|pages=614–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (instituting a major change in his religious policies),&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Freeman|title=A.D. 381: Heretics, Pagans, and the Christian State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H26HufWjzMC&amp;pg=PT116|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=26 January 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59020-522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} which removed non-Nicene Christians from church office and abolished the last remaining expressions of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] by making its [[holidays]] into workdays, banned blood sacrifices, closed Roman temples, and disbanded the [[Vestal Virgins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CosmanJones2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Madeleine Pelner Cosman|author2=Linda Gale Jones|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Jf5t1vFw1QC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0907-7|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practices of taking [[auspices]] and [[witchcraft]] were punished.

In 392 he became sole Emperor (the last one to claim sole and effective rule over an Empire including the Western provinces). From this moment till the end of his reign in 395, while non-Christians continued to request toleration,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus4.59&quot;&gt;Zosimus 4.59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SymmachusRelatio3&quot;&gt;Symmachus Relatio 3.&lt;/ref&gt; he ordered, authorized, or at least failed to punish, the closure or destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grindle1892pp29-30&quot;&gt;Grindle, Gilbert (1892) ''The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire'', pp.29–30. Quote summary: For example, Theodosius ordered Cynegius (Zosimus 4.37), the praetorian prefect of the East, to permanently close down the temples and forbade the worship of the deities throughout Egypt and the East.

In 393 he issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any public non-Christian religious customs,&lt;ref name=&quot;hughes&quot;&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT &quot;A History of the Church&quot;, Philip Hughes, Sheed &amp; Ward, rev ed 1949], vol I chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and was particularly oppressive to [[Manicheans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstChristianTheologiansp68&quot;&gt;&quot;The First Christian Theologians: An Introduction to Theology in the Early Church&quot;, Edited by Gillian Rosemary Evans, contributor Clarence Gallagher SJ, &quot;The Imperial Ecclesiastical Lawgivers&quot;, p68, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0-631-23187-0&lt;/ref&gt; He is likely to have disbanded the [[ancient Olympic Games]], whose last record of celebration was in 393, though archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held after this date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrottet2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Perrottet|title=The Naked Olympics: The True Story of the Ancient Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=8 June 2004|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-382-4|pages=190–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Western Roman Emperor Valentinian II, usurpation, and another civil war==
On  16 May 392, [[Valentinian II]] was found hanged in his residence in the town of [[Vienne]] in [[Gaul]]. 
The Frankish general [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], Valentinian's protector and [[magister militum]], maintained that it was suicide. 
Arbogast and Valentinian had frequently disputed rulership over the Western Roman Empire, and Valentinian was also noted to have complained of Arbogast's control over him to Theodosius. Thus when word of his death reached Constantinople, Theodosius believed, or at least suspected, that Arbogast was lying and had engineered Valentinian's demise. 
These suspicions were further fueled by Arbogast's elevation of [[Eugenius]], from Roman commander and official, to the position of Western Emperor. [[Ambrose]], the Bishop of Milan, spoke some veiled accusations against Arbogast, in his funeral [[oration]] for Valentinian II.

Valentinian II's death sparked a civil war between Eugenius and Theodosius over the rulership of the west, resulting in the [[Battle of the Frigidus]]. The eastern victory there led to the final brief unification of the Roman Empire under Theodosius, and the ultimate irreparable division of the empire after his death.

==Death and legacy==
Theodosius died, after suffering from a disease involving severe [[edema]], in [[Milan]] on  17 January 395. Ambrose organized and managed Theodosius' lying in state in Milan. Ambrose delivered a [[panegyric]] titled ''De Obitu Theodosii''&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Stilicho]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in which Ambrose praised the suppression of paganism by Theodosius. 
Theodosius was finally buried in Constantinople on 8 November 395.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodosius's army rapidly dissolved after his death, with Gothic contingents raiding as far as Constantinople. As his heir in the East he left Arcadius, who was about eighteen years old,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/constant/arcadius.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in the West Honorius, who was ten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Honorius-Roman-emperor&lt;/ref&gt; Neither ever showed any sign of fitness to rule, and their reigns were marked by [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|a series of disasters]]. As their guardians Theodosius left Stilicho, who ruled in the name of Honorius in the Western Empire, and [[Flavius Rufinus]] who was the actual power behind the throne in the East.

'''Magnus Maximus''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Magnus Maximus Augustus}}, {{lang-cy|Macsen Wledig}}) (ca. 335 – August 28, 388) was [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] [[Roman Emperor]] from 383 to 388.

In 383 as commander of Britain, he usurped the throne against emperor [[Gratian]]; and through negotiation with emperor [[Theodosius I]] the following year he was made emperor in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] – while Gratian's brother [[Valentinian II]] retained [[Roman Italy|Italy]], [[Pannonia]], [[Hispania]], and [[Africa Province|Africa]]. In 387 Maximus' ambitions led him to invade Italy, resulting in his defeat by [[Theodosius I]] at the [[Battle of the Save]] in 388. In the view of some historians his death marked the end of direct imperial presence in Northern Gaul and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500-c. 700&quot; by Paul Fouracre, Rosamond McKitterick (page 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Maximus was born in [[Gallaecia]], on the estates of [[Count Theodosius]] (the Elder) to who was a nephew and  [[Flavius Iulius Eucherius]] son and Marcellinus Brother.  Near contemporaries described his dignity as offended when lesser men were promoted to high positions.

Maximus was a distinguished general, who served under Count Theodosius in Africa in 373 and on the [[Danube]] in 376. It is likely he also may have been a junior officer in Britain in 368, during the quelling of the [[Great Conspiracy]]. Assigned to [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 380, he defeated an incursion of the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]] in 381.

The western emperor [[Gratian]] had become unpopular because of perceived favouritism toward [[Alans]] over Roman citizens. The Alans are an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Iranian]] speaking people (see also [[Sarmatians]] and [[Ossetians]]) who were early adopters of [[Christianity]] and migrated both east and west from their homeland.

In 383 Maximus was proclaimed emperor by his troops. He went to [[Gaul]] to pursue his imperial ambitions, taking a large portion of the British garrison troops with him.

Following his landing in Gaul, Maximus went out to meet his main opponent, emperor Gratian, whom he defeated near [[Paris]]. Gratian, after fleeing, was killed at [[Lyon]] on August 25, 383. Continuing his campaign into [[Italy]], Maximus was stopped from overthrowing [[Valentinian II]], who was only twelve, when [[Theodosius I]], the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]], sent [[Flavius Bauto]] with a powerful force to stop him. Negotiations followed in 384 including the intervention of [[Ambrose]], Bishop of Milan, leading to an accord with Valentinian II and Theodosius I in which Maximus was recognized as [[Augustus (rank)|Augustus]] in the west.

Maximus made his capital at Augusta Treverorum (Treves, [[Trier]]) in Gaul, and ruled Britain, Gaul, Spain and Africa. He issued coinage and a number of edicts reorganizing Gaul's system of provinces. Some scholars believe Maximus may have founded the office of the [[Comes Britanniarum]] as well. He became a popular emperor; [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] delivered a [[panegyric]] on Maximus' virtues. He used ''foederati'' forces such as the [[Alamanni]] to great effect. He was also a stern persecutor of [[heresy|heretics]]. It was on his orders that [[Priscillian]] and six companions became the first people in the history of [[Christianity]] to be executed for [[heresy]], in this case of [[Priscillianism]], by other Christians (though the civil charges laid by Maximus himself were for the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or &quot;witchcraft&quot;, technically spiritual fraud by use of ventriloquism),&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Josef Klauck, Brian McNeil Magic and paganism in early Christianity: the world of the Acts of the Apostles (2003), p.66&lt;/ref&gt; and their property was confiscated. These executions went ahead despite the wishes of prominent men such as [[St. Martin of Tours]]. Maximus' edict of 387 or 388 which censured Christians at Rome for burning down a Jewish synagogue, was condemned by bishop [[Ambrose]], who said people exclaimed: ‘the emperor has become a Jew’ &lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Patrologia Latina, 16–17 (1845), nos. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:162 Magnus Maximus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Magnus Maximus.]]
In 387 Maximus managed to force emperor [[Valentinian II]] out of [[Milan]], after which he fled to [[Theodosius I]].
Theodosius I and [[Valentinian II]] then invaded from the east, and campaigned against Magnus Maximus in July–August 388, their troops being led by  [[Richomeres]] and other generals. Maximus was defeated in the [[Battle of the Save]],&lt;ref&gt;Pan. Lat. II.34&lt;/ref&gt; and retreated to [[Aquileia]]. Meanwhile, the [[Franks]] under [[Marcomer]] had taken the opportunity to invade northern Gaul, at the same time further weakening Maximus' position.

[[Andragathius]], ''[[magister equitum]]'' of Maximus and the killer of emperor Gratian, was defeated near [[Siscia]] while Maximus' brother, Marcellinus, fell in battle at [[Poetovio]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan. Lat. II.35-6&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus surrendered in Aquileia, and although he pleaded for mercy was executed. The Senate passed a decree of ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]'' against him. However, his mother and at least two daughters were spared.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Ep. 40.32&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius' trusted general [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] strangled Maximus' son, [[Flavius Victor]], at Trier in the fall of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wise Bauer, &quot;The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade&quot;, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 22 feb 2010 (p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly happened to Maximus' family after his downfall is not recorded. He is known to have had a wife, who is recorded as having sought spiritual counsel from [[St. Martin of Tours]] during his time at Trier.  Her ultimate fate, and even her name (but see the Welsh tradition below), have not been preserved in definitive historic records. The same is true of Maximus' mother and daughters, other than that they were spared by Theodosius I.

One of Maximus' daughters may have been married to Ennodius, proconsul Africae (395). Ennodius' grandson was [[Petronius Maximus]], another ill-fated emperor, who ruled in Rome for but 77 days before he was stoned to death while fleeing from the Vandals on May 24, 455. Other descendants of Ennodius, and thus possibly of Maximus, included [[Olybrius|Anicius Olybrius]], emperor in 472, but also several consuls and bishops such as [[Magnus Felix Ennodius|St. Magnus Felix Ennodius]] (Bishop of [[Pavia]] c. 514-21).  We also encounter an otherwise unrecorded daughter of Magnus Maximus, [[Sevira]], on the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], an early medieval inscribed stone in Wales which claims her marriage to [[Vortigern]], king of the Britons.

==Role in British and Breton history ==
Maximus' bid for imperial power in 383 coincides with the last date for any evidence of a Roman military presence in Wales, the western [[Pennines]], and the fortress of [[Chester|Deva]]. Coins dated later than 383 have been found in excavations along [[Hadrian's Wall]], suggesting that troops were not stripped from it, as was once thought.&lt;ref name=Frere1&gt;{{Citation

Having left with the troops and senior administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend supports that this happened, with stories such as ''Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig'' (English: The Dream of Emperor Maximus), where he not only marries a wondrous British woman (thus making British descendants probable), but also gives her father sovereignty over Britain (thus formally transferring authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves).

The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus (referred to as ''Macsen/Maxen Wledig'', or ''Emperor Maximus'') the role of founding father of the dynasties of several medieval Welsh kingdoms, including those of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the [[Fifteen Tribes of Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachel Bromwich 2006&quot;&gt;Rachel Bromwich, editor and translator. Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads. Cardiff: [[University of Wales Press]], Third Edition, 2006. 441-444&lt;/ref&gt;

After he became emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Maximus would return to Britain to campaign against the [[Picts]] and Scots (i.e., Irish), probably in support of Rome's long-standing allies the [[Damnonii]], [[Votadini]], and [[Novantae]] (all located in modern [[Scotland]]). While there he likely made similar arrangements for a formal transfer of authority to local chiefs&amp;mdash;the later rulers of [[Galloway]], home to the Novantae, would claim Maximus as the founder of their line, the same as did the Welsh kings.&lt;ref name=Frere1/&gt;

The ninth century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' gives another account of Maximus and assigns him an important role:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The seventh emperor was Maximianus, (One of a great many confusions and conflations on Geoffrey's part). He withdrew from Britain with all its military force, slew Gratianus the king of the Romans, and obtained the sovereignty of all Europe. Unwilling to send back his warlike companions to their wives, families, and possessions in Britain, he conferred upon them numerous districts from the lake on the summit of Mons lovis, to the city called Cant Guic, and to the western Tumulus, that is Cruc Occident. These are the Armoric Britons, and they remain there to the present day. In consequence of their absence, Britain being overcome by foreign nations, the lawful heirs were cast out, till God interposed with his assistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern historians believe that this idea of mass British troop settlement in [[Brittany]] by Maximus may very well reflect some reality, as it accords with archaeological and other historical evidence and later Breton traditions.

[[Armorica]] declared independence from the Roman Empire in 407 CE, but contributed archers for [[Flavius Aetius]]'s defence against [[Attila]] the Hun, and its king [[Riothamus]] was subsequently mentioned in contemporary documents as an ally of Rome's against the [[Goths]]. Despite its continued usage of two distinct languages, Breton and Gallo, and extensive invasions and conquests by Franks and Vikings, Armorica retained considerable cultural cohesion into the 13th century.

Maximus also established a military base in his native [[Gallaecia]], i.e. [[Galicia (Spain)]], which persisted as a cultural entity despite occupation by the [[Suebi]] in 409, see [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. This kingdom successfully resisted the Moors and subsequently initiated the Spanish [[Reconquista]].

Aetius sent large numbers of [[Alans]] to both Armorica and Galicia following the defeat of Attila at the [[Battle of the Catalunian Plains]]. The Alans evidently assimilated quickly into the local Celtic cultures, contributing their own legends, e.g. to the Arthurian Cycle of romances.

==Welsh legend==
Legendary versions of Maximus' career in which he marries the Welsh princess [[Elen Luyddog|Elen]] may have circulated in popular tradition in Welsh-speaking areas from an early date. Although the story of Helen and Maximus's meeting is almost certainly fictional, there is some evidence for the basic claims. He is certainly given a prominent place in the earliest version of the [[Welsh Triads]] which are believed to date from c. 1100 and which reflect far older traditions. Welsh poetry also frequently refers to Macsen as a figure of comparison with later Welsh leaders. These legends come down to us in two separate versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachel Bromwich 2006&quot;/&gt;

=== Geoffrey of Monmouth ===
{{wikisource|History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5}}
According to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s fictional ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''ca.'' 1136), the basis for many English and Welsh legends, Maximianus as he calls him, was a Roman senator, a nephew of [[Coel Hen]] through Coel's brother Ioelinus, and king of the [[Brythons]] following the death of [[Octavius (King of the Britons)]]. Geoffrey writes this came about  because Octavius wanted to wed his daughter to such a powerful half-Roman-half-Briton and to give the kingship of Britain, as a dowry, to that husband, so he sent a message to Rome offering his daughter to Maximian.

[[Caradocus]], the [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], had suggested and supported the marriage between Octavius's daughter and Maximian. Maximian accepted the offer and left Rome for Britain. Geoffrey claims further that Maximian gathered an army as he sacked [[Franks|Frankish]] towns along the way. He invaded Clausentum (modern [[Southampton]]) unintentionally and nearly fought the army of the Britons under [[Conan Meriadoc|Conanus]] before agreeing to a truce. Following further negotiations, Maximian was given the kingship of Britain and Octavius retired. Five years into his kingship, Magnus Maximus assembled a vast fleet and invaded [[Gaul]], leaving Britain in the control of Caradocus. Upon reaching the kingdom of [[Armorica]] (historically, the region between the Loire and Seine rivers, later comprising Brittany, Normandy, Anjou, Maine and Touraine), he defeated the king and killed thousands of inhabitants. Before departing to Rome, he summoned [[Conan Meriadoc|Conanus]], the rebellious nephew of Octavius, and asked him to rule as king of the land, which was renamed [[Brittany]], or &quot;Little Britain&quot;. Conan's men married native women after cutting out their tongues to preserve the purity of their language. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] presents this legend to explain the Welsh name for Brittany, Llydaw, as originating from ''lled-taw'' or &quot;half-silent&quot;. Given that Conan was well established in genealogies as the founder of Brittany, this account is certainly connected to an older tradition than Geoffrey.

Following the death of Caradocus, rule of Britain as regent passed to [[Dionotus]], who - facing a foreign invasion - appealed to Maximus, who finally sent a man named [[Gracianus Municeps]] with two legions to stop the attack. He killed many thousands before the invaders fled to [[Ireland]]. Maximus died in [[Rome]] soon after and Dionotus became the official king of the Britons. Unfortunately, before he could begin his reign, Gracianus took hold of the crown and made himself king over Dionotus.

===The Dream of Macsen Wledig===
{{wikisource|The Mabinogion/The Dream of Maxen Wledig|The Dream of Maxen Wledig}}
{{main|The Dream of Macsen Wledig}}

Although the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' tale ''The Dream of Macsen Wledig'' is written in later manuscripts than Geoffrey's version, the two accounts are so different that scholars agree the Dream cannot be based purely on Geoffrey's version. The Dream's account also seems to accord better with details in the Triads, so it perhaps reflects an earlier tradition.

Macsen Wledig, the Emperor of Rome, dreams one night of a lovely maiden in a wonderful, far-off land. Awakening, he sends his men all over the earth in search of her. With much difficulty they find her in a rich castle in Wales, daughter of a chieftain based at [[Segontium Roman Fort|Segontium]] ([[Caernarfon]]), and lead the Emperor to her. Everything he finds is exactly as in his dream. The maiden, whose name is [[Helen of the Hosts|Helen]] or Elen, accepts and loves him. Because Elen is found a virgin, Macsen gives her father sovereignty over the island of Britain and orders three castles built for his bride.  In Macsen's absence, a new emperor seizes power and warns him not to return. With the help of men from Britain led by Elen's brother [[Conan Meriadoc|Conanus]] (''[[Welsh language|Welsh]]'': Kynan Meriadoc, ''[[Breton language|Breton]]'': Conan Meriadeg), Macsen marches across Gaul and Italy and recaptures Rome. In gratitude to his British allies, Macsen rewards them with a portion of Gaul that becomes known as Brittany.

==Later literature==
The prominent place of Macsen in history, Welsh legend and in the [[Matter of Britain]] means he is often a character or referred to in historical and Arthurian fiction. Such stories include [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s [[Pendragon Cycle]], [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', [[Jack Whyte]]'s Camulod Chronicles, [[Nancy McKenzie]]'s ''[[Queen of Camelot]]'' and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]''. The popular Welsh [[folk music|folk song]] ''[[Yma o Hyd]]'', recorded by [[Dafydd Iwan]] in 1981, recalls Macsen Wledig and celebrates the continued survival of the [[Welsh people]] since his days.

'''Flavius Eugenius''' (died 6 September 394) was a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] in the [[Western Roman Empire]] (392–394) against [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]]. Though himself a [[Christian]], he was the last Emperor to support [[Roman polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard Friell]] (1998). ''Theodosius: The Empire at Bay (Roman Imperial Biographies)''. (Routledge; 1 edition (May 28, 1998)). ISBN 0-415-17040-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
A former teacher of grammar and rhetoric, as well as ''magister scrinorum'', Eugenius was an acquaintance of the [[Franks|Frankish]] ''[[magister militum]]'' and of the ''de facto'' ruler of the Western Roman Empire, [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]].

===Rise to power===
Following the death of [[Valentinian II]], [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], who had probably been the cause of Valentinian II's murder or suicide, elevated Eugenius to the purple (22 August 392). The choice of Eugenius, over proclaiming himself, offered to Arbogast two strong advantages: first, Eugenius, a Roman, was more suitable than Arbogast, a Frank, as an emperor; furthermore, the [[Roman Senate]] would have been more likely to have supported Eugenius than Arbogast.

===Civil, religious, and military policies===
After being installed as Emperor, Eugenius changed the imperial administrators. When Theodosius had left the western half of the empire to Valentinian II, he had put his own men in the highest civil offices, to keep a strong grasp on the whole empire. Eugenius replaced these administrators with others loyal to himself, coming from the senatorial class. [[Virius Nicomachus Flavianus]] the Elder became [[praetorian prefecture of Italy|Praetorian Prefect of Italy]], his son [[Nicomachus Flavianus (son)|Nicomachus Flavianus]] the Younger received the title of Prefect of Rome, while the new ''[[grain supply to the city of Rome|praefectus annonae]]'' was [[Numerius Proiectus]].

Eugenius was nominally a Christian, and therefore was reluctant to accept a program of imperial support to [[Polytheism]]. His men, however, convinced Eugenius to use public money to fund pagan projects, such as the rededication of the [[Temple of Venus and Rome]] and the restoration of the [[Altar of Victory]] within the [[Curia]] (removed by Emperor [[Gratian]]). This religious policy created tension with Theodosius and the powerful and influential Bishop [[Ambrose]], who left his see in [[Milan]] when the imperial court of Eugenius arrived.

Eugenius was also successful in the military field, notably in the renovation of old alliances with [[Alamanni]] and Franks. Arbogast, who was a Frank and had also Alamanni and Frankish soldiers in his ranks, marched to the [[Rhine]] frontier, where he impressed and pacified the Germanic tribes by parading his army in front of them.

===Fall===
When he was elected emperor, Eugenius sent ambassadors to Theodosius's court, asking for recognition of his election. Theodosius received them, but started to gather troops to defeat Eugenius. Theodosius also promoted his eight-year-old son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] to the rank of &quot;[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]&quot; of the West in January 393.

Theodosius then moved from Constantinople with his army, and met Eugenius and Arbogast in the [[Battle of the Frigidus]] ([[Vipava Valley]], [[Slovenia]]) on 6 September 394. The bloody battle lasted two days, and was marked by unusual astronomical and meteorological events, but in the end Theodosius won. Arbogast immediately committed suicide after the defeat, while Eugenius was held for execution as a criminal, his head afterward being displayed in Theodosius' camp.

==Evaluation==
The reign of Eugenius marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Five months later Theodosius died, dividing his empire between his two sons. This had happened many times before in the previous two centuries, but this time it was to be final – the Roman Empire never reunited, even under [[Leo I the Thracian]] (when there was no Western Emperor for some periods), and soon after his reign, the western half fell.

Eugenius also represented the last opportunity for the pagans, with the senatorial class, to oppose the Christianization of the Empire. The Battle of the Frigidus was part of a trend towards using increasing percentages of barbarian troops, especially in the west, where it led to the weakening of the Empire itself.
